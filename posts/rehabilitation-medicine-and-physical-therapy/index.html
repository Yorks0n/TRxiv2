This pioneering study aims to examine perfectionism, moral injury, and burnout among UK-based physiotherapists across the NHS, private practice, sports, and academia. Method: This cross-sectional study utilised an online survey and implementation of Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) to assess the interplay of Perfectionism (Multidimension Perfectionism Scale-Short Form), Moral Injury (Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Healthcare Professionals) and Burnout (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire). Our sample size calculation shows representation of the UK physiotherapy profession via utilisation of 95% confidence interval with a 5% margin of error. Findings: Our analysis conducted on (n=402) UK-based physiotherapists reveals significant burnout levels - 96% are categorised as moderate to high. Furthermore, associations and SEM of Perfectionism and Moral Injury collectively account for a substantial proportion of burnout variability (r2.62), highlighting their sequential impact on burnout manifestation. Interpretation: With such high levels of burnout, urgent intervention is paramount. Elevated burnout presents challenges for the physiotherapy profession as staff retention, accurate and effective patient care, and overall health are severely impacted due to burnout. Recognising and addressing perfectionism and moral injury becomes pivotal to mitigate its impact on individual and collective health.\nVery low levels of physical activity among a broad group of patients hospitalized following hip fracture: A prospective cohort study (the HIP-ME-UP cohort study)\nAuthors: Hansen, M. S.; Kristensen, M. T.; Zilmer, C. K.; Berger, A. L.; Kirk, J. W.; Skibdal, K. M.; Kallemose, T.; Bandholm, T.; Pedersen, M. M.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.24302483\nObjectives: The evidence supports early and intensive mobilization and physical activity for hospitalized patients following a hip fracture. Since bedrest and inactivity during acute care are potentially fatal, we need updated knowledge of levels of physical activity in a diverse clinical population. Therefore, the objective was to determine levels of physical activity among a broad representation of patients hospitalized following hip fracture, and secondly to explore the association with 30-day post-discharge readmission, and mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Data were collected at two university hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark from March to June 2023. Participants: Patients hospitalized following hip fracture. Main outcome measures: 24-hr upright time (time standing and walking) was measured from inclusion (post-operative day (POD) 1-3) to discharge using a thigh-worn accelerometer. Readmission and mortality were verified by electronic patient records. Results: 101 patients (62 women) with a mean (SD) age of 79.9 (8.4) years were included. The median (IQR) 24-hr upright time on POD2-6 ranged from 15 (6.9:31.0) to a maximum of 34 (16:67) mins. Patients with cognitive impairment had less upright time than patients without. Post-surgery length of stay was a median of 7 (5:8) days. 25% of the patients were readmitted or had emergency ward referrals and 3% died within 30 days of discharge (no clear association with upright time). Conclusions: Physical activity seems extremely low among a broad representation of patients within the first week following a hip fracture but was not found to influence readmissions. Considering the strong evidence supporting physical activity during acute hospitalization, the low activity level in these patients calls for action. Clinicaltrials.gov-identifier: NCT05756517\n",
