The aim of this study was to examine whether kinesiophobia is negatively associated with physical activity and what factors influence this relationship. MethodsThree databases were searched for articles including both a measure of kinesiophobia and physical activity. Two reviewers screened articles for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from each study. Pearson product-moment correlations were pooled from eligible studies using the generic inverse pooling and random effects method to examine the relationship between kinesiophobia and physical activity. ResultsForty-nine articles were included in the systematic review and 41 studies (n = 4,848) in the meta-analysis.

Design: We used a qualitative descriptive design over two rounds of data collection with three participant groups: i) people with experience of rehabilitation for Long COVID (PwLC), ii) NHS staff delivering and/or managing community rehabilitation services (allied health professionals (AHPs)), and iii) NHS staff involved in strategic planning around Long COVID in their health board (Long COVID leads). Setting: Four NHS Scotland territorial health boards. Participants: 51 interviews: eight Long COVID leads (11 interviews), 15 AHPs (25 interviews), and 15 PwLC (15 interviews). Results: Three key themes were identified: i) Accessing care for PwLC, ii) Understanding Long COVID and its management, and iii) Strengths and limitations of existing Long COVID rehabilitation services. Conclusions: Organisational delivery of Long COVID community rehabilitation is complex and presents multiple challenges. In addition, access to Long COVID community rehabilitation can be challenging. When accessed, these services are valued by PwLC but require adequate planning, publicity, and resource. The findings presented here can be used by those developing and delivering services for people with Long COVID.\n",
