Preliminary efficacy would be indicated if a dose-response relationship exists between performed exercise dose and degree of postoperative recovery. The objective was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of home-based rehabilitation using elastic band exercise on performance-based function after THA, based on the association between performed exercise dose and change in performance-based function (gait speed) from 3 (start of intervention) to 10 weeks (end of intervention) after surgery. MethodsA pre-registered (NCT03109821) prospective cohort study was conducted. Following primary THA, patients were prescribed home-based rehabilitation exercise using elastic bands. Performed exercise dose (repetitions/week) was objectively measured using attached sensor technology. Primary outcome was change in gait speed (40m fast-paced walk test). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported hip disability. In the primary analysis, a linear regression model was used. ResultsNinety-four patients (39 women) with a median age of 66.5 years performed a median of 339 exercise repetitions/week (1st-3rd quartile: 209-549). Across outcomes, participants significantly improved from 3 to 10-week follow-up. The association between performed exercise dose and change in mean gait speed was 0.01 m/sec [95% CI: -0.01; 0.02] per 100 repetitions. ConclusionsWe found no indication of preliminary efficacy of home-based rehabilitation exercise using elastic bands, as no significant and clinically relevant associations between performed exercise dose and changes in outcomes were present. Trials comparing postoperative rehabilitation exercise with no exercise early after THA are warranted.\n",
