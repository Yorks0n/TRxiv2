K.; Young, D. L.; Roemmich, R. T.; Raghavan, P.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.24301026\nBackgroundAfter discharged from the hospital for acute stroke, individuals typically receive rehabilitation in one of three settings: inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), or home with community services (i.e., home health or outpatient clinics). The initial setting of post-acute care (i.e., discharge location) is related to mortality and hospital readmission; however, the impact of this setting on the change in functional mobility at 90-days after discharge is still poorly understood. The purpose of this work was to examine the impact of discharge location on the change in functional mobility between hospital discharge and 90-days post-discharge. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used the electronic health record to identify individuals admitted to Johns Hopkins Medicine with an acute stroke and who had measurements of mobility [Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Basic Mobility (AM-PAC BM)] at discharge from the acute hospital and 90-days post-discharge. Individuals were grouped by discharge location (IRF=190 [40%], SNF=103 [22%], Home with community services=182 [(38%]). We compared the change in mobility from time of discharge to 90-days post-discharge in each group using a difference-in-differences analysis and controlling for demographics, clinical characteristics, and social determinants of health. ResultsWe included 475 individuals (age 64.4 [14.8] years; female: 248 [52.2%]). After adjusting for covariates, individuals who were discharged to an IRF had a significantly greater improvement in AM-PAC BM from time of discharge to 90-days post-discharge compared to individuals discharged to a SNF or home with community services ({beta}=-3.5 (1.4), p=0.01 and {beta}=-8.2 (1.3), p=\u003c0.001, respectively). ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the initial post-acute rehabilitation setting impacts the magnitude of functional recovery at 90-days after discharge from the acute hospital. These findings support the need for high-intensity rehabilitation and for policies that facilitate the delivery of high-intensity rehabilitation after stroke.\nThe Effect of Sensory Reweighting on Postural Control and Cortical Activity in Parkinsons Disease\nAuthors: Sadeghi, M.; Bristow, T.; Fakorede, S.; Liao, K.; Palmer, J. A.; Lyons, K.; Pahwa, R.; Huang, C.-K.; Akinwuntan, A.; Devos, H.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301687\nAimsBalance requires the cortical control of visual, somatosensory, and vestibular inputs. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the contributions of each of these systems on postural control and cortical activity using a sensory reweighting approach between participants with Parkinsons disease (PD) and controls. MethodsTen participants with PD (age: 72 {+/-} 9; 3 women; Hoehn \u0026 Yahr: 2 [1.5 - 2.50]) and 11 controls (age: 70 {+/-} 3; 4 women) completed a sensory organization test in virtual reality (VR-SOT) while cortical activity was being recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Conditions 1 to 3 were completed on a stable platform; conditions 4 to 6 on a foam. Conditions 1 and 4 were done with eyes open; conditions 2 and 5 in a darkened VR environment; and conditions 3 and 6 in a moving VR environment. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in center of pressure (COP) displacement and EEG alpha and theta/beta ratio power between the two groups across the postural control conditions. Condition 1 was used as reference in all analyses. ResultsParticipants with PD showed greater COP displacement than controls in the anteroposterior (AP) direction when relying on vestibular input (condition 5; p\u003c0.0001). The mediolateral (ML) COP sway was greater in PD than in controls when relying on the somatosensory (condition 2; p = 0.03), visual (condition 4; p = 0.002), and vestibular (condition 5; p \u003c 0.0001) systems. Participants with PD exhibited greater alpha power compared to controls when relying on visual input (condition 2; p = 0.003) and greater theta/beta ratio power when relying on somatosensory input (condition 4; p = 0.001). ConclusionsPD affects reweighting of postural control, exemplified by greater COP displacement and increased cortical activity. Further research is needed to establish the temporal dynamics between cortical activity and COP displacement.\n",
