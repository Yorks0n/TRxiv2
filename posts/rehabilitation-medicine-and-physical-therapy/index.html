LC comprises a wide range of dysautonomia symptoms, including fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, pain and brain fog. This study tested the feasibility and estimated the efficacy, of a Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback (HRV-B) technique via a standardised slow diaphragmatic breathing programme in individuals with LC. Methods and AnalysisLC patients underwent a 4-week HRV-B intervention for 10 minutes twice daily for a total of 4 weeks using the Polar H10 ECG (Electrocardiogram) chest strap and Elite HRV phone application. Outcome measures C19-YRSm (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale modified), EQ5D-5L (EuroQol 5 Dimensions), Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31), WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), and Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between heartbeats (RMSSD) using a Fitbit device were completed before and after the intervention. The study was pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05228665. Results13 participants (54% female, 46% male) completed the study with high levels of data completeness and adherence. There was a statistically significant improvement in C19YRS-m (p=0.001), EQ5D Global Health Score (p=0.009), COMPASS-31 (p=0.007), RMSSD (p=0.047) and EHODAS (p=0.02). Qualitative feedback suggested participants were able to use it independently, were satisfied with the intervention, and reported beneficial effects from the intervention.

P.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295576\nBackground and PurposeIn the chronic phase after a stroke, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) initially plateau before steadily increasing. However, the benefits of pre-stroke levels of physical activity on these limitations remain unclear. To clarify this relationship, this study compares the effect of physical activity on the long-term evolution of I/ADL limitations between stroke survivors and stroke-free controls. MethodsLongitudinal data from 2,143 stroke survivors and 10,717 matched stroke-free controls aged 50 and over were drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE; 2004-2020). Physical activity was assessed on the wave preceding the stroke event and number of I/ADL limitations during the post-stroke chronic phase. Each stroke survivor was matched with 5 stroke-free controls who had similar propensity scores that were computed based on key covariates. The effect of pre-stroke physical activity on I/ADL limitations in stroke survivors was compared to its effect in stroke-free controls with a similar time lag between physical activity and I/ADL assessments using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, education level, and the number of chronic conditions. ResultsIn stroke survivors, the beneficial effect of pre-stroke physical activity on ADL limitations after stroke is significantly stronger than its effect in stroke-free controls matched for baseline age, sex, body mass index, limitations in I/ADL, chronic conditions, and country of residence, before any of the participants had experienced a stroke. ConclusionsPhysical activity is an effective preventive intervention that reduces the risk of functional dependence after stroke. In addition, pre-stroke level of physical activity is an important variable in the prognosis of functional dependence after stroke.\n",
