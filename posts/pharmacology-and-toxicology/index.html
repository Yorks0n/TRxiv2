Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.\nSGLT2 inhibitors attenuate endothelial to mesenchymal transition and cardiac fibroblast activation\nAuthors: Schmidt, K.; Schmidt, A.; Gross, S.; Just, A.; Pfanne, A.; Fuchs, M.; Jordan, M.; Mohr, E.; Pich, A.; Fiedler, J.; Thum, T.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572273\nBeneficial effects of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in cardiovascular diseases have been extensively reported leading to the inclusion of these drugs in the treatment guidelines for heart failure. However, molecular actions especially on non-myocyte cells remain uncertain. We observed dose-dependent inhibitory effects of two SGLT2is, dapagliflozin (DAPA) and empagliflozin (EMPA), on inflammatory signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Proteomics analyses and subsequent enrichment analyses discovered profound effects of these SGLT2is on proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration and actin cytoskeleton. Validation in functional oxygen consumption measurements as well as tube formation and migration assays revealed strong impacts of DAPA. Considering that most influenced parameters played central roles in endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT), we performed in vitro EndMT assays and identified substantial reduction of mesenchymal and fibrosis marker expression as well as changes in cellular morphology upon treatment with SGLT2is. In line, human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) exposed to DAPA showed less proliferation, reduced ATP production, and decelerated migration capacity while less extensive impacts were observed upon EMPA. Mechanistically, sodium proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) as well as sodium-myoinositol cotransporter (SMIT) and sodium-multivitamin cotransporter (SMVT) could be identified as relevant targets of SGLT2is in non-myocyte cardiovascular cells as validated by individual siRNA-knockdown experiments. In summary, we found comprehensive beneficial effects of SGLT2is on human endothelial cells and cardiac fibroblasts. The results of this study therefore support a distinct effect of selected SGLT2i on non-myocyte cardiovascular cells and grant further insights into potential molecular mode of action of these drugs.\n",
