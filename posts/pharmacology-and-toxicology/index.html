A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

P.; Samal, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552173\nBreast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.\nChemical and biophysical characterization of novel potassium channel blocker 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine\nAuthors: Sun, Y.; Rodriguez-Rangel, S.; Zhang, L. L.; Sanchez-Rodriguez, J. E.; Brugarolas, P.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.550404\n4-aminopyridine (4AP) is a potassium (K+) channel blocker used clinically to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple derivatives of 4AP capable of blocking K+ channels have been reported including three radiolabeled with positron emitting isotopes for imaging demyelinated lesions using PET. Here, we describe 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine (5Me3F4AP), a novel K+ channel blocker with potential application in PET. 5Me3F4AP has comparable potency to 4AP and 3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine (3F4AP). Compared to 3F4AP, 5Me3F4AP is more lipophilic (logD = 0.664 {+/-} 0.005 vs. 0.414 {+/-} 0.002) and slightly more basic (pKa = 7.46 {+/-} 0.01 vs. 7.37 {+/-} 0.07). In addition, 5Me3F4AP appears to be more permeable to an artificial brain membrane and stable towards oxidation by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1), responsible for the metabolism of 4AP and 3F4AP. Taken together, 5Me3F4AP has promising properties for PET imaging warranting additional investigation.\nPharmacology of Berberine and its Metabolites, is it the natures Ozempic or Imatinib?\nAuthors: Singh, N. K.; Dhanasekaran, M.; Kumar, A. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552100\nBackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools. Materials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool. ResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of \u003c4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were \u003e 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (\u003c1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values \u003c 5 uM. ConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.\nMolecular pharmacology of selective NaV1.6 and dual NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channel inhibitors that suppress excitatory neuronal activity ex vivo\nAuthors: Goodchild, S.

However, all currently available sodium channel targeting anti-seizure medications are non-selective among the NaV isoforms which potentially limits efficacy and therapeutic safety margins. XPC-7724 and XPC-5462 represent a new class of small molecule compounds. These compounds target inhibition of the NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channels in excitatory pyramidal neurons and possess a molecular selectivity of \u003e100 fold against NaV1.1 channels that are dominant in inhibitory cells. This profile will enable pharmacological dissection of the physiological roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and help to define the role of each channel in disease states. These compounds bind to and stabilize the inactivated-state of the channels, demonstrate higher potency with longer residency times, and slower off-rates than carbamazepine and phenytoin. These compounds possess cellular selectivity ex vivo in inhibiting action potential firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons, whilst sparing fast spiking inhibitory interneurons. XPC-5462 also suppresses epileptiform activity in an ex vivo brain slice seizure model. This class of compounds provides a unique approach for treating neuronal excitability disorders by selectively down-regulating excitatory circuits.\nDetermining the shelf life of an erythropoietin alfa biosimilar GBPD002 through stability study\nAuthors: Nag, K.; Mohiuddin, M.; Kumar, S.; Khan, M.

In this study, samples were analyzed according to current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) and regulatory guidelines to evaluate the quality of the product under the influence of variety of environmental factors in a time-dependent manner. Accelerated (25 {+/-} 2 {degrees}C and relative humidity: 60 {+/-} 5 %) and real-time (5 {+/-} 3 {degrees}C) stability study were conducted up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively; samples were analyzed in every 3 months. After 12 months, real-time stability studies were performed with 6 months interval up to18 months, which to be continued up to 24 months. Appearance and pH were assessed using standard methods, and molecular weight was determined by Western blotting. Chromatographic identification and quantitative assays were performed by reversed- phase chromatography (RPC). High-molecular weight aggregatesand degradants were determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. Biofunctionality of the samples were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays. Bacterial endotoxin and sterility test were performed as safety parameters. All samples met the acceptance criteria, and the data were extrapolated using the regulatory guideline to determine the shelf life. The data revealed that the GBPD002 is stable up to 24 months.\n",

Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

        <p class="abstract">Breast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">4-aminopyridine (4AP) is a potassium (K&#43;) channel blocker used clinically to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple derivatives of 4AP capable of blocking K&#43; channels have been reported including three radiolabeled with positron emitting isotopes for imaging demyelinated lesions using PET. Here, we describe 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine (5Me3F4AP), a novel K&#43; channel blocker with potential application in PET. 5Me3F4AP has comparable potency to 4AP and 3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine (3F4AP). Compared to 3F4AP, 5Me3F4AP is more lipophilic (logD = 0.664 {&#43;/-} 0.005 vs. 0.414 {&#43;/-} 0.002) and slightly more basic (pKa = 7.46 {&#43;/-} 0.01 vs. 7.37 {&#43;/-} 0.07). In addition, 5Me3F4AP appears to be more permeable to an artificial brain membrane and stable towards oxidation by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1), responsible for the metabolism of 4AP and 3F4AP. Taken together, 5Me3F4AP has promising properties for PET imaging warranting additional investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools.

Materials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool.

ResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of &lt;4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were &gt; 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (&lt;1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values &lt; 5 uM.

ConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.</p>

However, all currently available sodium channel targeting anti-seizure medications are non-selective among the NaV isoforms which potentially limits efficacy and therapeutic safety margins. XPC-7724 and XPC-5462 represent a new class of small molecule compounds. These compounds target inhibition of the NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channels in excitatory pyramidal neurons and possess a molecular selectivity of &gt;100 fold against NaV1.1 channels that are dominant in inhibitory cells. This profile will enable pharmacological dissection of the physiological roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and help to define the role of each channel in disease states. These compounds bind to and stabilize the inactivated-state of the channels, demonstrate higher potency with longer residency times, and slower off-rates than carbamazepine and phenytoin. These compounds possess cellular selectivity ex vivo in inhibiting action potential firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons, whilst sparing fast spiking inhibitory interneurons. XPC-5462 also suppresses epileptiform activity in an ex vivo brain slice seizure model. This class of compounds provides a unique approach for treating neuronal excitability disorders by selectively down-regulating excitatory circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">GBPD002 is a recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cell expression system. In this study, samples were analyzed according to current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) and regulatory guidelines to evaluate the quality of the product under the influence of variety of environmental factors in a time-dependent manner. Accelerated (25 {&#43;/-} 2 {degrees}C and relative humidity: 60 {&#43;/-} 5 %) and real-time (5 {&#43;/-} 3 {degrees}C) stability study were conducted up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively; samples were analyzed in every 3 months. After 12 months, real-time stability studies were performed with 6 months interval up to18 months, which to be continued up to 24 months. Appearance and pH were assessed using standard methods, and molecular weight was determined by Western blotting. Chromatographic identification and quantitative assays were performed by reversed- phase chromatography (RPC). High-molecular weight aggregatesand degradants were determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. Biofunctionality of the samples were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays. Bacterial endotoxin and sterility test were performed as safety parameters. All samples met the acceptance criteria, and the data were extrapolated using the regulatory guideline to determine the shelf life. The data revealed that the GBPD002 is stable up to 24 months.</p>
