First-generation TPD agents exploit a limited set of broadly expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases with constitutive activity, forbidding their application to proteins requiring higher levels of targeting selectivity. Here, by phenotype-based screening, we discovered that the antipsychotic drug acepromazine possesses interferon-enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines expressing high levels of aldo-keto reductases 1C. These enzymes convert acepromazine into its stereo-selective metabolite (S)-hydroxyl-acepromazine, which recruits the interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex, resulting in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Co-crystal structures of acepromazine and derivatives in complex with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 revealed a ligandable pocket, which was exploited for designing heterobifunctional degraders. The resulting chemicals selectively degrade multimeric proteins-- such as those in biomolecular condensates--without affecting monomeric proteins, consistent with the requirement of substrate-induced clustering for TRIM21 activation. As aberrant protein assemblies have been causally linked to diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and cancer, our findings highlight the potential of TRIM21-based multimer-selective degraders as a strategy to tackle the direct causes of these diseases.\nPerinatal ampicillin administration modulates murine bile acid metabolism in vivo - an observational study\nAuthors: Thomas, S. P.; Askarian, F.; Kousha, A.; Suzuki, E.; Tsai, C. M.; Liu, G.; Nizet, V.; Dorrestein, P. C.; Tsunoda, S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578215\nAntibiotics are an indispensable tool of modern medicine, yet their impact extends beyond eliminating harmful bacteria to perturbing the commensal bacteria constituting the gut microbiome. This collateral damage is particularly significant in early life when the gut microbiome is still developing. In humans, antibiotic administration during infancy and childhood is associated with various long-term negative health outcomes. However, existing research has predominantly focused on the direct administration of antibiotics to infants, leaving uncertainties about whether indirect antibiotic exposure produces similar effects. Here, we use mouse models to investigate how three distinct routes of exposure to the commonly prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin influences parent and infant metabolism. These methods simulate major modes of both direct and indirect antibiotic exposure: intravenous antibiotic administration to the mother immediately before birth mimicking intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotic use by the mother during lactation, and direct administration to infants mimicking empiric antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis. Through untargeted metabolomics of fecal samples from mouse dams and infants, we identified one class of compounds, bile acids and related cholane steroids, as particularly sensitive to ampicillin treatment. Bile acids, produced by the host and extensively modified by the gut microbiome, serve as important mediators in the cross-talk between the microbiota and the host. Here, we detail the coordinated changes in bile acid metabolism in response to a commonly prescribed antibiotic, focusing on dams treated both pre- and postpartum. Additionally, we identify unique bile acids associated with weight gain in infant mice. ImportanceAntibiotics are widely used perinatally, administered to both parents and infants before, during, and after birth. While they can play a life-saving role, antibiotics also result in collateral damage to the beneficial microbes constituting the gut microbiome. These microbes have many important functions, particularly in the metabolism of small molecules in the body. One such group of molecules, bile acids, undergo extensive modifications by bacteria and may act as a \"language\" through which microbes communicate with the host. This observational study investigates the impact of the commonly prescribed antibiotic ampicillin on the metabolism of these molecules during childbirth. Our results indicate that ampicillin administration pre- or post-partum significantly alters the mothers bile acid metabolism, but has a minimal influence on infant bile acid levels. However, in all cases, ampicillin administration significantly increased infant weight, even when the antibiotic was solely administered to the mother.\nCardiovascular and Locomotor Effects of Binary Mixtures of Common Bath Salts Constituents: Studies with Methylone, MDPV, and Caffeine in Rats\nAuthors: Seaman, R. W.; Galindo, D. G.; Stinson, B. T.; Sulima, A.; Rice, K. C.; Javors, M. A.; Ginsburg, B. C.; Collins, G. T.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578069\nBackground and PurposeThe use of \"Bath Salts\" drug preparations has been associated with high rates of toxicity and death. Preparations often contain mixtures of drugs including multiple synthetic cathinones or synthetic cathinones and caffeine; however, little is known about whether interactions among \"Bath Salts\" constituents contribute to the adverse effects often reported in users. Experimental ApproachThis study used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to characterize the cardiovascular effects, locomotor effects, and pharmacokinetics of methylone, MDPV, and caffeine, administered alone and as binary mixtures. Dose-addition analyses were used to determine the effect levels predicted for a strictly additive interaction for each dose pair. Key ResultsMethylone, MDPV, and caffeine increased heart rate and locomotion, with methylone producing the largest increase in heart rate, MDPV producing the largest increase in locomotor activity, and caffeine being the least effective in stimulating heart rate and locomotor activity. MDPV and caffeine increased mean arterial pressure, with caffeine being more effective than MDPV. The nature of the interactions between methylone and MDPV tended toward sub-additivity for all endpoints, whereas interactions between MDPV or methylone and caffeine tended to be additive or sub-additive for cardiovascular endpoints, and additive or supra-additive for increases in locomotion. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between individual constituents, but methylone displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics at the largest dose evaluated. Conclusion and ImplicationsThese findings demonstrate that the composition of \"Bath Salts\" preparations can impact both cardiovascular and locomotor effects and suggest that such interactions among constituent drugs could contribute to the \"Bath Salts\" toxidrome reported by human users. What is already known\"Bath Salts\" preparations are associated with a sympathomimetic toxidrome in human users. What this study addsCharacterization of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between common \"Bath Salts\" constituents with regard to cardiovascular and locomotor effects. Clinical SignificanceThe vast majority of drug overdose deaths involve more than one substance. Though these studies focused on combinations of stimulant drugs, they provide direct evidence that the toxidrome resulting from multi-drug overdoses can be significantly different than would be expected for a single drug.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and PurposeThe use of &#34;Bath Salts&#34; drug preparations has been associated with high rates of toxicity and death. Preparations often contain mixtures of drugs including multiple synthetic cathinones or synthetic cathinones and caffeine; however, little is known about whether interactions among &#34;Bath Salts&#34; constituents contribute to the adverse effects often reported in users.

Experimental ApproachThis study used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to characterize the cardiovascular effects, locomotor effects, and pharmacokinetics of methylone, MDPV, and caffeine, administered alone and as binary mixtures. Dose-addition analyses were used to determine the effect levels predicted for a strictly additive interaction for each dose pair.

Key ResultsMethylone, MDPV, and caffeine increased heart rate and locomotion, with methylone producing the largest increase in heart rate, MDPV producing the largest increase in locomotor activity, and caffeine being the least effective in stimulating heart rate and locomotor activity. MDPV and caffeine increased mean arterial pressure, with caffeine being more effective than MDPV. The nature of the interactions between methylone and MDPV tended toward sub-additivity for all endpoints, whereas interactions between MDPV or methylone and caffeine tended to be additive or sub-additive for cardiovascular endpoints, and additive or supra-additive for increases in locomotion. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between individual constituents, but methylone displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics at the largest dose evaluated.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThese findings demonstrate that the composition of &#34;Bath Salts&#34; preparations can impact both cardiovascular and locomotor effects and suggest that such interactions among constituent drugs could contribute to the &#34;Bath Salts&#34; toxidrome reported by human users.

What is already known&#34;Bath Salts&#34; preparations are associated with a sympathomimetic toxidrome in human users.

What this study addsCharacterization of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between common &#34;Bath Salts&#34; constituents with regard to cardiovascular and locomotor effects.

Clinical SignificanceThe vast majority of drug overdose deaths involve more than one substance. Though these studies focused on combinations of stimulant drugs, they provide direct evidence that the toxidrome resulting from multi-drug overdoses can be significantly different than would be expected for a single drug.</p>
