The sodium (Na&#43;) leak channel (NALCN) is a member of the four-domain voltage-gated cation channel family that includes the prototypical voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels (NaVs and CaVs, respectively). Unlike NaVs and CaVs, which have four lateral fenestrations that serve as routes for lipophilic compounds to enter the central cavity to modulate channel function, NALCN has bulky residues (W311, L588, M1145 and Y1436) that block these openings.">

G.; Serra, O.; Carnevale, V.; Pless, S.; Chua, H. C.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.12.536537\nThe sodium (Na+) leak channel (NALCN) is a member of the four-domain voltage-gated cation channel family that includes the prototypical voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels (NaVs and CaVs, respectively). Unlike NaVs and CaVs, which have four lateral fenestrations that serve as routes for lipophilic compounds to enter the central cavity to modulate channel function, NALCN has bulky residues (W311, L588, M1145 and Y1436) that block these openings. Structural data suggest that oc-cluded lateral fenestrations underlie the pharmacological resistance of NALCN to lipophilic compounds, but functional evidence is lacking. To test this hypothesis, we unplugged the fenestrations of NALCN by substituting the four aforementioned resi-dues with alanine (AAAA) and compared the effects of NaV, CaV and NALCN block-ers on both wild-type (WT) and AAAA channels. Most compounds behaved in a simi-lar manner on both channels, but phenytoin and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) elicited additional, distinct responses on AAAA channels. Further experiments using single alanine mutants revealed that phenytoin and 2-APB enter the inner cav-ity through distinct fenestrations, implying structural specificity to their modes of ac-cess. Using a combination of computational and functional approaches, we identified amino acid residues critical for 2-APB activity, supporting the existence of drug bind-ing site(s) within the pore region. Intrigued by the activity of 2-APB and its ana-logues, we tested additional compounds containing the diphenylmethane/amine moiety on WT channels. We identified compounds from existing clinically used drugs that exhibited diverse activity, thus expanding the pharmacological toolbox for NALCN. While the low potencies of active compounds reiterate the resistance of NALCN to pharmacological targeting, our findings lay the foundation for rational drug design to develop NALCN modulators with refined properties. Significance statementThe sodium leak channel (NALCN) is essential for survival: mutations cause life-threatening developmental disorders in humans. However, no treatment is currently available due to the resistance of NALCN to pharmacological targeting. One likely reason is that the lateral fenestrations, a common route for clinically used drugs to enter and block related ion channels, are occluded in NALCN. Using a combination of computational and functional approaches, we unplugged the fenestrations of NALCN which led us to the first molecularly defined drug binding site within the pore region. Besides that, we also identified additional NALCN modulators from existing clinically used therapeutics, thus expanding the pharmacological toolbox for this leak channel.\nSelective degradation of multimeric proteins via chemically induced proximity to TRIM21\nAuthors: Lu, P.; Cheng, Y.; Xue, L.; Ren, X.; Chen, C.; Li, J.; Wu, Q.; Sun, S.; Hou, J.; Jia, W.; Li, C.; Qi, X.; Huang, N.; Han, T.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578122\nTargeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as an effective strategy to eliminate disease-causing proteins by inducing their interactions with the protein degradation machinery. First-generation TPD agents exploit a limited set of broadly expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases with constitutive activity, forbidding their application to proteins requiring higher levels of targeting selectivity. Here, by phenotype-based screening, we discovered that the antipsychotic drug acepromazine possesses interferon-enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines expressing high levels of aldo-keto reductases 1C. These enzymes convert acepromazine into its stereo-selective metabolite (S)-hydroxyl-acepromazine, which recruits the interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex, resulting in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Co-crystal structures of acepromazine and derivatives in complex with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 revealed a ligandable pocket, which was exploited for designing heterobifunctional degraders. The resulting chemicals selectively degrade multimeric proteins-- such as those in biomolecular condensates--without affecting monomeric proteins, consistent with the requirement of substrate-induced clustering for TRIM21 activation. As aberrant protein assemblies have been causally linked to diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and cancer, our findings highlight the potential of TRIM21-based multimer-selective degraders as a strategy to tackle the direct causes of these diseases.\nSafety, pharmacokinetics, and potential neurological interactions of ivermectin, tafenoquine and chloroquine in Rhesus Macaques\nAuthors: Vanachayangkul, P.; Kodchakorn, C.; Ta-aksorn, W.; Im-Erbsin, R.; Tungtaeng, A.; Tipthara, P.; Tarning, J.; Lugo-Roman, L. A.; Wojnarski, M.; Vesely, B. A.; Kobylinski, K. C.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578449\nIvermectin could be used for malaria control as treated persons are lethal to blood feeding Anopheles, resulting in reduced transmission. Tafenoquine could be used in combination with ivermectin to clear persons of liver stage Plasmodium vivax reservoir and as a prophylactic in high-risk populations. The safety of ivermectin and tafenoquine has not been evaluated. As earlier forms of 8-aminoquinolones were neurotoxic, and ivermectin is an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein blood brain barrier transporter, there is concern that co-administration could be neurotoxic. The safety and pharmacokinetic interaction of tafenoquine, ivermectin, and chloroquine was evaluated in Rhesus macaques. No clinical, biochemistry, or hematological outcomes of concern were observed. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery was employed to assess potential neurological deficits following drug administration. Some impairment was observed with tafenoquine alone and in the same monkeys with subsequent co-administrations. Co-administration of chloroquine and tafenoquine resulted in increased plasma exposure to tafenoquine. Urine concentrations of the 5,6 orthoquinone TQ metabolite were increased with co-administration of tafenoquine with ivermectin. There was an increase in ivermectin plasma exposure when co-administered with chloroquine. No interaction of tafenoquine on ivermectin was observed in vitro. Chloroquine and trace levels of ivermectin, but not tafenoquine, were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. The 3\"-O-demethyl ivermectin metabolite was observed in macaque plasma but not in urine or cerebrospinal fluid. Overall, the combination of ivermectin, tafenoquine, and chloroquine did not have clinical, neurological, or pharmacological interactions of concern in macaques, therefore this combination could be considered for evaluation in human trials.\nLarge- and Small-Animal Studies of Safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Biodistribution of Inflammasome-Targeting Nanoligomer in the Brain and Other Target Organs\nAuthors: Risen, S.; Kusick, B.; Sharma, S.; Gilberto, V.; Brindley, S.; Aguilar, M.; Brown, J.; McGrath, S.; Chatterjee, A.; Moreno, J.; Nagpal, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579323\nThe human immune system is the key line of defense in the body against infections and disease and is critical for our survival. However, immune malfunction or misrecognition of healthy cells and tissue, termed autoimmune disease, is implicated in more than 80 disease conditions and multiple other secondary pathologies. While pan-immunosuppressive therapies like steroids offer some relief for systemic inflammation for some organs, many patients never achieve remission and such drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier making them ineffective for tackling neuroinflammation. Especially in the brain, unintended activation of microglia and astrocytes is hypothesized to be directly or indirectly responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson Disease (PD), and Alzheimer Disease (AD). Recent studies have also shown that targeting inflammasome and specific immune targets can be beneficial for a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Further, our previous studies have shown targeting NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 through brain penetrant Nanoligomer cocktail SB_NI_112 (abbreviated to NI112) can be therapeutic for several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show safety-toxicity studies, followed by pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in small- (mice) and large-animal (dog) studies of this inflammasome-targeting Nanoligomer cocktail NI 112 which downregulates NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3. We conducted studies using four different routes of administration: intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SQ), intraperitoneal (IP), and intranasal (IN), and identified the drug concentration over time using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the blood serum, the brain (including different brain regions), and other target organs like liver, kidney, and colon. Our results indicate the Nanoligomer cocktail has a strong safety profile, has a consistent peak concentration in blood serum, and shows high biodistribution (F) and delivery across all routes of administration. Further analysis of multiexponential serum concentration with time shows while the bound/unbound ratio is highly dependent on the route of administration, species (dog/mice), and dosage, the bound serum to Nanoligomer concentration in the brain is consistent at ~30%. Moreover, different dosing in dogs through IV and SQ routes also show predictability in bound serum concentration, and constant ratio when comparing large- and small-animal data (dog and mice). We hypothesize the constant ratio is determined by target protein amount, and PK parameters such as area under the curve (AUC) and can be used for more accurate interspecies scaling/dose determination. These results provide an excellent platform for translating and predicting therapeutic dosage between routes of administration in the same species, and a good prediction of scaling between species to attain similar target inhibition using high affinity and specificity of Nanoligomer binding the target.\nThe contribution of neutrophils to bacteriophage clearance and pharmacokinetics in vivo\nAuthors: Echterhof, A.; Dharmaraj, T.; McBride, R.; Berry, J. D.; Hopkins, M.; Selvakumar, H.; Lin, K.-Y.; Chia, L.; Shen, C.-C.; Lioa, W.; Lee, P.; Yeh, T.; Suh, G.; Blankenberg, F. G.; Frymoyer, A.; Bollyky, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577154\nWith the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.\nDevelopment of a LRRC15-Targeted Radio-Immunotheranostic Approach to Deplete Pro-tumorigenic Mechanisms and Immunotherapy Resistance\nAuthors: Storey, C.

L.; Ulmert, D.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577289\nLeucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) has emerged as an attractive biomarker and target for cancer therapy. We have developed a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), DUNP19, that specifically binds to a phylogenetically conserved LRRC15 epitope and is internalized by target-expressing cancer and stromal cells. In xenograft mouse models, Lutetium-177 labeled DUNP19 ([177Lu]-DUNP19) enables non-invasive imaging and precise radiotherapy to LRRC15-expressing cancer cells and murine cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), halting tumor progression and prolonging survival with minimal toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of [177Lu]-DUNP19-treated tumors reveal a loss of pro-tumorigenic mechanisms, including a transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta})-driven and LRRC15+ signature associated with immunotherapy resistance. Together, these results demonstrate that radio-theranostic targeting of LRRC15 with DUNP19 is a compelling precision medicine platform for image-guided diagnosis, eradication, and reprogramming of LRRC15+ tumor tissue that drives immuno-resistance and aggressive disease. SIGNIFICANCEWe introduce a pioneering LRRC15-guided radio-theranostic approach integrating clinical imaging and radioimmunotherapy. Our strategy utilizes a mAb, DUNP19, to target LRRC15-expressing cancer cells and fibroblasts, demonstrating significant tumor reduction, prolonged survival, and reversal of TGF{beta}-driven treatment resistance. This approach offers a promising strategy for improving outcomes in aggressive cancers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The sodium (Na&#43;) leak channel (NALCN) is a member of the four-domain voltage-gated cation channel family that includes the prototypical voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels (NaVs and CaVs, respectively). Unlike NaVs and CaVs, which have four lateral fenestrations that serve as routes for lipophilic compounds to enter the central cavity to modulate channel function, NALCN has bulky residues (W311, L588, M1145 and Y1436) that block these openings. Structural data suggest that oc-cluded lateral fenestrations underlie the pharmacological resistance of NALCN to lipophilic compounds, but functional evidence is lacking. To test this hypothesis, we unplugged the fenestrations of NALCN by substituting the four aforementioned resi-dues with alanine (AAAA) and compared the effects of NaV, CaV and NALCN block-ers on both wild-type (WT) and AAAA channels. Most compounds behaved in a simi-lar manner on both channels, but phenytoin and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) elicited additional, distinct responses on AAAA channels. Further experiments using single alanine mutants revealed that phenytoin and 2-APB enter the inner cav-ity through distinct fenestrations, implying structural specificity to their modes of ac-cess. Using a combination of computational and functional approaches, we identified amino acid residues critical for 2-APB activity, supporting the existence of drug bind-ing site(s) within the pore region. Intrigued by the activity of 2-APB and its ana-logues, we tested additional compounds containing the diphenylmethane/amine moiety on WT channels. We identified compounds from existing clinically used drugs that exhibited diverse activity, thus expanding the pharmacological toolbox for NALCN. While the low potencies of active compounds reiterate the resistance of NALCN to pharmacological targeting, our findings lay the foundation for rational drug design to develop NALCN modulators with refined properties.

Significance statementThe sodium leak channel (NALCN) is essential for survival: mutations cause life-threatening developmental disorders in humans. However, no treatment is currently available due to the resistance of NALCN to pharmacological targeting. One likely reason is that the lateral fenestrations, a common route for clinically used drugs to enter and block related ion channels, are occluded in NALCN. Using a combination of computational and functional approaches, we unplugged the fenestrations of NALCN which led us to the first molecularly defined drug binding site within the pore region. Besides that, we also identified additional NALCN modulators from existing clinically used therapeutics, thus expanding the pharmacological toolbox for this leak channel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as an effective strategy to eliminate disease-causing proteins by inducing their interactions with the protein degradation machinery. First-generation TPD agents exploit a limited set of broadly expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases with constitutive activity, forbidding their application to proteins requiring higher levels of targeting selectivity. Here, by phenotype-based screening, we discovered that the antipsychotic drug acepromazine possesses interferon-enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines expressing high levels of aldo-keto reductases 1C. These enzymes convert acepromazine into its stereo-selective metabolite (S)-hydroxyl-acepromazine, which recruits the interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex, resulting in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Co-crystal structures of acepromazine and derivatives in complex with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 revealed a ligandable pocket, which was exploited for designing heterobifunctional degraders. The resulting chemicals selectively degrade multimeric proteins-- such as those in biomolecular condensates--without affecting monomeric proteins, consistent with the requirement of substrate-induced clustering for TRIM21 activation. As aberrant protein assemblies have been causally linked to diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and cancer, our findings highlight the potential of TRIM21-based multimer-selective degraders as a strategy to tackle the direct causes of these diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ivermectin could be used for malaria control as treated persons are lethal to blood feeding Anopheles, resulting in reduced transmission. Tafenoquine could be used in combination with ivermectin to clear persons of liver stage Plasmodium vivax reservoir and as a prophylactic in high-risk populations. The safety of ivermectin and tafenoquine has not been evaluated. As earlier forms of 8-aminoquinolones were neurotoxic, and ivermectin is an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein blood brain barrier transporter, there is concern that co-administration could be neurotoxic. The safety and pharmacokinetic interaction of tafenoquine, ivermectin, and chloroquine was evaluated in Rhesus macaques. No clinical, biochemistry, or hematological outcomes of concern were observed. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery was employed to assess potential neurological deficits following drug administration. Some impairment was observed with tafenoquine alone and in the same monkeys with subsequent co-administrations. Co-administration of chloroquine and tafenoquine resulted in increased plasma exposure to tafenoquine. Urine concentrations of the 5,6 orthoquinone TQ metabolite were increased with co-administration of tafenoquine with ivermectin. There was an increase in ivermectin plasma exposure when co-administered with chloroquine. No interaction of tafenoquine on ivermectin was observed in vitro. Chloroquine and trace levels of ivermectin, but not tafenoquine, were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. The 3&#34;-O-demethyl ivermectin metabolite was observed in macaque plasma but not in urine or cerebrospinal fluid. Overall, the combination of ivermectin, tafenoquine, and chloroquine did not have clinical, neurological, or pharmacological interactions of concern in macaques, therefore this combination could be considered for evaluation in human trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human immune system is the key line of defense in the body against infections and disease and is critical for our survival. However, immune malfunction or misrecognition of healthy cells and tissue, termed autoimmune disease, is implicated in more than 80 disease conditions and multiple other secondary pathologies. While pan-immunosuppressive therapies like steroids offer some relief for systemic inflammation for some organs, many patients never achieve remission and such drugs do not cross the blood-brain barrier making them ineffective for tackling neuroinflammation. Especially in the brain, unintended activation of microglia and astrocytes is hypothesized to be directly or indirectly responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson Disease (PD), and Alzheimer Disease (AD). Recent studies have also shown that targeting inflammasome and specific immune targets can be beneficial for a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Further, our previous studies have shown targeting NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3 through brain penetrant Nanoligomer cocktail SB_NI_112 (abbreviated to NI112) can be therapeutic for several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show safety-toxicity studies, followed by pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in small- (mice) and large-animal (dog) studies of this inflammasome-targeting Nanoligomer cocktail NI 112 which downregulates NF-{kappa}B and NLRP3. We conducted studies using four different routes of administration: intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SQ), intraperitoneal (IP), and intranasal (IN), and identified the drug concentration over time using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the blood serum, the brain (including different brain regions), and other target organs like liver, kidney, and colon. Our results indicate the Nanoligomer cocktail has a strong safety profile, has a consistent peak concentration in blood serum, and shows high biodistribution (F) and delivery across all routes of administration. Further analysis of multiexponential serum concentration with time shows while the bound/unbound ratio is highly dependent on the route of administration, species (dog/mice), and dosage, the bound serum to Nanoligomer concentration in the brain is consistent at ~30%. Moreover, different dosing in dogs through IV and SQ routes also show predictability in bound serum concentration, and constant ratio when comparing large- and small-animal data (dog and mice). We hypothesize the constant ratio is determined by target protein amount, and PK parameters such as area under the curve (AUC) and can be used for more accurate interspecies scaling/dose determination. These results provide an excellent platform for translating and predicting therapeutic dosage between routes of administration in the same species, and a good prediction of scaling between species to attain similar target inhibition using high affinity and specificity of Nanoligomer binding the target.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) has emerged as an attractive biomarker and target for cancer therapy. We have developed a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), DUNP19, that specifically binds to a phylogenetically conserved LRRC15 epitope and is internalized by target-expressing cancer and stromal cells. In xenograft mouse models, Lutetium-177 labeled DUNP19 ([177Lu]-DUNP19) enables non-invasive imaging and precise radiotherapy to LRRC15-expressing cancer cells and murine cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), halting tumor progression and prolonging survival with minimal toxicity. Transcriptomic analyses of [177Lu]-DUNP19-treated tumors reveal a loss of pro-tumorigenic mechanisms, including a transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta})-driven and LRRC15&#43; signature associated with immunotherapy resistance. Together, these results demonstrate that radio-theranostic targeting of LRRC15 with DUNP19 is a compelling precision medicine platform for image-guided diagnosis, eradication, and reprogramming of LRRC15&#43; tumor tissue that drives immuno-resistance and aggressive disease.

SIGNIFICANCEWe introduce a pioneering LRRC15-guided radio-theranostic approach integrating clinical imaging and radioimmunotherapy. Our strategy utilizes a mAb, DUNP19, to target LRRC15-expressing cancer cells and fibroblasts, demonstrating significant tumor reduction, prolonged survival, and reversal of TGF{beta}-driven treatment resistance. This approach offers a promising strategy for improving outcomes in aggressive cancers.</p>
