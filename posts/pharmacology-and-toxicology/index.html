First-generation TPD agents exploit a limited set of broadly expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases with constitutive activity, forbidding their application to proteins requiring higher levels of targeting selectivity. Here, by phenotype-based screening, we discovered that the antipsychotic drug acepromazine possesses interferon-enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines expressing high levels of aldo-keto reductases 1C. These enzymes convert acepromazine into its stereo-selective metabolite (S)-hydroxyl-acepromazine, which recruits the interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex, resulting in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Co-crystal structures of acepromazine and derivatives in complex with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 revealed a ligandable pocket, which was exploited for designing heterobifunctional degraders. The resulting chemicals selectively degrade multimeric proteins, such as those in biomolecular condensates, without affecting monomeric proteins, consistent with the requirement of substrate-induced clustering for TRIM21 activation. As aberrant protein assemblies have been causally linked to diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and cancer, our findings highlight the potential of TRIM21-based multimer-selective degraders as a strategy to tackle the direct causes of these diseases.\nThe contribution of neutrophils to bacteriophage clearance and pharmacokinetics in vivo\nAuthors: Echterhof, A.; Dharmaraj, T.; McBride, R.; Berry, J. D.; Hopkins, M.; Selvakumar, H.; Lin, K.-Y.; Chia, L.; Shen, C.-C.; Lioa, W.; Lee, P.; Yeh, T.; Suh, G.; Blankenberg, F. G.; Frymoyer, A.; Bollyky, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577154\nWith the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.\nPerinatal ampicillin administration modulates murine bile acid metabolism in vivo - an observational study\nAuthors: Thomas, S. P.; Askarian, F.; Kousha, A.; Suzuki, E.; Tsai, C. M.; Liu, G.; Nizet, V.; Dorrestein, P. C.; Tsunoda, S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578215\nAntibiotics are an indispensable tool of modern medicine, yet their impact extends beyond eliminating harmful bacteria to perturbing the commensal bacteria constituting the gut microbiome. This collateral damage is particularly significant in early life when the gut microbiome is still developing. In humans, antibiotic administration during infancy and childhood is associated with various long-term negative health outcomes. However, existing research has predominantly focused on the direct administration of antibiotics to infants, leaving uncertainties about whether indirect antibiotic exposure produces similar effects. Here, we use mouse models to investigate how three distinct routes of exposure to the commonly prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin influences parent and infant metabolism. These methods simulate major modes of both direct and indirect antibiotic exposure: intravenous antibiotic administration to the mother immediately before birth mimicking intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotic use by the mother during lactation, and direct administration to infants mimicking empiric antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis. Through untargeted metabolomics of fecal samples from mouse dams and infants, we identified one class of compounds, bile acids and related cholane steroids, as particularly sensitive to ampicillin treatment. Bile acids, produced by the host and extensively modified by the gut microbiome, serve as important mediators in the cross-talk between the microbiota and the host. Here, we detail the coordinated changes in bile acid metabolism in response to a commonly prescribed antibiotic, focusing on dams treated both pre- and postpartum. Additionally, we identify unique bile acids associated with weight gain in infant mice.\nCardiovascular and Locomotor Effects of Binary Mixtures of Common Bath Salts Constituents: Studies with Methylone, MDPV, and Caffeine in Rats\nAuthors: Seaman, R. W.; Galindo, D. G.; Stinson, B. T.; Sulima, A.; Rice, K. C.; Javors, M. A.; Ginsburg, B. C.; Collins, G. T.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578069\nBackground and Purpose: The use of Bath Salts drug preparations has been associated with high rates of toxicity and death. Preparations often contain mixtures of drugs including multiple synthetic cathinones or synthetic cathinones and caffeine; however, little is known about whether interactions among Bath Salts constituents contribute to the adverse effects often reported in users. Experimental Approach: This study used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to characterize the cardiovascular effects, locomotor effects, and pharmacokinetics of methylone, MDPV, and caffeine, administered alone and as binary mixtures. Dose-addition analyses were used to determine the effect levels predicted for a strictly additive interaction for each dose pair. Key Results: Methylone, MDPV, and caffeine increased heart rate and locomotion, with methylone producing the largest increase in heart rate, MDPV producing the largest increase in locomotor activity, and caffeine being the least effective in stimulating heart rate and locomotor activity. MDPV and caffeine increased mean arterial pressure, with caffeine being more effective than MDPV. The nature of the interactions between methylone and MDPV tended toward sub-additivity for all endpoints, whereas interactions between MDPV or methylone and caffeine tended to be additive or sub-additive for cardiovascular endpoints, and additive or supra-additive for increases in locomotion. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between individual constituents, but methylone displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics at the largest dose evaluated. Conclusion and Implications: These findings demonstrate that the composition of Bath Salts preparations can impact both cardiovascular and locomotor effects and suggest that such interactions among constituent drugs could contribute to the Bath Salts toxidrome reported by human users. What is already known: Bath Salts preparations are associated with a sympathomimetic toxidrome in human users. What this study adds: Characterization of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between common Bath Salts constituents with regard to cardiovascular and locomotor effects. Clinical Significance: The vast majority of drug overdose deaths involve more than one substance. Though these studies focused on combinations of stimulant drugs, they provide direct evidence that the toxidrome resulting from multi-drug overdoses can be significantly different than would be expected for a single drug.\nSilver nanoparticles can be sampled by ultrafiltration probe but elution into \u0026 recovery from plasma and DPBS differs in vitro\nAuthors: risselada, m.; Mc Cain, R. R.; Bates, M. G.; Anderson, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577516\nWe compared 1) the influence of elution fluid on rate, pattern, and completeness of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) elution, and 2) ultrafiltration (UF) probe and direct sampling in vitro. Six specimens (2.5ml of 0.02mg/ml 10nm AgNP and 5.0ml of 30% poloxamer 407) contained in a dialysis tube (12-14kDa pores) were placed in 100ml Dulbeccos Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) (n=3) or canine plasma (n=3) for 96h on a stirred hot plate (37{degrees}C and 600rpm) and sampled 20 times. Six pipette and UF probe samples were taken of a 0.001mg AgNP/ml DPBS or plasma solution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to analyze Ag. Stock plasma contained Ag. At 96h, 5/6 dialysis tubes had not fully released AgNP. One peak in hourly Ag increase was present in DPBS (10-13h), and two peaks in plasma (6-8h and 10-13h). The hourly Ag increase in plasma decreased earlier than in DPBS. UF probe sampling was possible in both DPBS and plasma and resulted in higher Ag concentrations but with more variation than pipette samples. While in vitro use of DPBS might be more cost effective, plasma should be considered due to difference in elution and recovery.\nCreating cell-specific computational models of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes using optical experiments\nAuthors: Yang, J.; Daily, N.; Pullinger, T. K.; Wakatsuki, T.; Sobie, E. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574577\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help understand the ionic underpinnings of, and to simulate, various cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created simulated datasets by applying various protocols to a population of in silico cells with known conductance variations, and we fitted to those datasets. We found that calibrating models to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation held regardless of whether the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses. Author SummaryMany drug treatments or environmental factors can trigger cardiac arrhythmias, which are dangerous and often unpredictable. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor stem cells have proven to be a promising model for studying these events, but variability in donor genetic background and cell maturation methods, as well as overall immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes relative to the adult heart, have hindered reproducibility and reliability of these studies. Mathematical models of these cells can aid in understanding the underlying electrophysiological contributors to this variability, but determining these models parameters for multiple cell preparations is challenging. In this study, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational method to simultaneously estimate multiple model parameters using data from imaging-based experiments, which can be easily scaled to rapidly characterize multiple cell lines. This method can generate many personalized models of individual cell preparations, improving drug response predictions and revealing specific differences in electrophysiological properties that contribute to variability in cardiac maturity and arrhythmia susceptibility.

        <p class="abstract">Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as an effective strategy to eliminate disease-causing proteins by inducing their interactions with the protein degradation machinery. First-generation TPD agents exploit a limited set of broadly expressed E3 ubiquitin ligases with constitutive activity, forbidding their application to proteins requiring higher levels of targeting selectivity. Here, by phenotype-based screening, we discovered that the antipsychotic drug acepromazine possesses interferon-enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines expressing high levels of aldo-keto reductases 1C. These enzymes convert acepromazine into its stereo-selective metabolite (S)-hydroxyl-acepromazine, which recruits the interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 to the vicinity of the nuclear pore complex, resulting in the degradation of nuclear pore proteins. Co-crystal structures of acepromazine and derivatives in complex with the PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 revealed a ligandable pocket, which was exploited for designing heterobifunctional degraders. The resulting chemicals selectively degrade multimeric proteins, such as those in biomolecular condensates, without affecting monomeric proteins, consistent with the requirement of substrate-induced clustering for TRIM21 activation. As aberrant protein assemblies have been causally linked to diseases such as neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and cancer, our findings highlight the potential of TRIM21-based multimer-selective degraders as a strategy to tackle the direct causes of these diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibiotics are an indispensable tool of modern medicine, yet their impact extends beyond eliminating harmful bacteria to perturbing the commensal bacteria constituting the gut microbiome. This collateral damage is particularly significant in early life when the gut microbiome is still developing. In humans, antibiotic administration during infancy and childhood is associated with various long-term negative health outcomes. However, existing research has predominantly focused on the direct administration of antibiotics to infants, leaving uncertainties about whether indirect antibiotic exposure produces similar effects. Here, we use mouse models to investigate how three distinct routes of exposure to the commonly prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotic ampicillin influences parent and infant metabolism. These methods simulate major modes of both direct and indirect antibiotic exposure: intravenous antibiotic administration to the mother immediately before birth mimicking intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotic use by the mother during lactation, and direct administration to infants mimicking empiric antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis. Through untargeted metabolomics of fecal samples from mouse dams and infants, we identified one class of compounds, bile acids and related cholane steroids, as particularly sensitive to ampicillin treatment. Bile acids, produced by the host and extensively modified by the gut microbiome, serve as important mediators in the cross-talk between the microbiota and the host. Here, we detail the coordinated changes in bile acid metabolism in response to a commonly prescribed antibiotic, focusing on dams treated both pre- and postpartum. Additionally, we identify unique bile acids associated with weight gain in infant mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and Purpose: The use of Bath Salts drug preparations has been associated with high rates of toxicity and death. Preparations often contain mixtures of drugs including multiple synthetic cathinones or synthetic cathinones and caffeine; however, little is known about whether interactions among Bath Salts constituents contribute to the adverse effects often reported in users. Experimental Approach: This study used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to characterize the cardiovascular effects, locomotor effects, and pharmacokinetics of methylone, MDPV, and caffeine, administered alone and as binary mixtures. Dose-addition analyses were used to determine the effect levels predicted for a strictly additive interaction for each dose pair. Key Results: Methylone, MDPV, and caffeine increased heart rate and locomotion, with methylone producing the largest increase in heart rate, MDPV producing the largest increase in locomotor activity, and caffeine being the least effective in stimulating heart rate and locomotor activity. MDPV and caffeine increased mean arterial pressure, with caffeine being more effective than MDPV. The nature of the interactions between methylone and MDPV tended toward sub-additivity for all endpoints, whereas interactions between MDPV or methylone and caffeine tended to be additive or sub-additive for cardiovascular endpoints, and additive or supra-additive for increases in locomotion. No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between individual constituents, but methylone displayed non-linear pharmacokinetics at the largest dose evaluated. Conclusion and Implications: These findings demonstrate that the composition of Bath Salts preparations can impact both cardiovascular and locomotor effects and suggest that such interactions among constituent drugs could contribute to the Bath Salts toxidrome reported by human users. What is already known: Bath Salts preparations are associated with a sympathomimetic toxidrome in human users. What this study adds: Characterization of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between common Bath Salts constituents with regard to cardiovascular and locomotor effects. Clinical Significance: The vast majority of drug overdose deaths involve more than one substance. Though these studies focused on combinations of stimulant drugs, they provide direct evidence that the toxidrome resulting from multi-drug overdoses can be significantly different than would be expected for a single drug.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We compared 1) the influence of elution fluid on rate, pattern, and completeness of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) elution, and 2) ultrafiltration (UF) probe and direct sampling in vitro. Six specimens (2.5ml of 0.02mg/ml 10nm AgNP and 5.0ml of 30% poloxamer 407) contained in a dialysis tube (12-14kDa pores) were placed in 100ml Dulbeccos Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) (n=3) or canine plasma (n=3) for 96h on a stirred hot plate (37{degrees}C and 600rpm) and sampled 20 times. Six pipette and UF probe samples were taken of a 0.001mg AgNP/ml DPBS or plasma solution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to analyze Ag. Stock plasma contained Ag. At 96h, 5/6 dialysis tubes had not fully released AgNP. One peak in hourly Ag increase was present in DPBS (10-13h), and two peaks in plasma (6-8h and 10-13h). The hourly Ag increase in plasma decreased earlier than in DPBS. UF probe sampling was possible in both DPBS and plasma and resulted in higher Ag concentrations but with more variation than pipette samples. While in vitro use of DPBS might be more cost effective, plasma should be considered due to difference in elution and recovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help understand the ionic underpinnings of, and to simulate, various cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters.

We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created simulated datasets by applying various protocols to a population of in silico cells with known conductance variations, and we fitted to those datasets. We found that calibrating models to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation held regardless of whether the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

Author SummaryMany drug treatments or environmental factors can trigger cardiac arrhythmias, which are dangerous and often unpredictable. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor stem cells have proven to be a promising model for studying these events, but variability in donor genetic background and cell maturation methods, as well as overall immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes relative to the adult heart, have hindered reproducibility and reliability of these studies. Mathematical models of these cells can aid in understanding the underlying electrophysiological contributors to this variability, but determining these models parameters for multiple cell preparations is challenging. In this study, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational method to simultaneously estimate multiple model parameters using data from imaging-based experiments, which can be easily scaled to rapidly characterize multiple cell lines. This method can generate many personalized models of individual cell preparations, improving drug response predictions and revealing specific differences in electrophysiological properties that contribute to variability in cardiac maturity and arrhythmia susceptibility.
