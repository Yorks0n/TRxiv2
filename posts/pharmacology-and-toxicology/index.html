O.; Cui, Z.\nScore: 143.5, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563139\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) administered intranasally as dry powders can be potentially applied for the treatment or pre-exposure prevention of viral infections in the upper respiratory tract. However, a method to transform the mAbs from liquid to dry powders suitable for intranasal administration and a device that can spray the dry powders to the desired region of the nasal cavity are needed to fully realize the potentials of the mAbs. Herein, we report that thin-film freeze-drying can be applied to prepare aerosolizable mAb dry powders and that the dry powders can be sprayed into the posterior nasal cavity using Aptar Pharmas Unidose (UDS) Powder Nasal Spray System. AUG-3387, a human-derived mAb that neutralizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was used in the present study. First, we prepared AUG-3387 thin-film freeze-dried powders (i.e., TFF AUG-3387 powders) from liquid formulations containing different levels of mAbs. The TFF AUG-3387 powder with the highest solid content (i.e., TFF AUG-3387C powder) was then chosen for further characterization, including the evaluation of the plume geometry, spray pattern, and particle size distribution after the powder was sprayed using the UDS Powder device. Finally, the deposition patterns of the TFF AUG-3387C powder sprayed using the UDS Powder device were studied using 3D-printed nasal replica casts based on an adult model and a child model. It is concluded that it is feasible to intranasally deliver mAbs as dry powders by transforming the mAbs into dry powders using thin-film freeze-drying and then spray the powder using the UDS Powder device.\nThe in vitro functional profiles of fentanyl and nitazene analogs at the μ-opioid receptor - high efficacy is dangerous regardless of signaling bias\nAuthors: Tsai, M.-H. M.; Chen, L.; Baumann, M. H.; Canals, M.; Javitch, J. A.; Lane, J. R.; Shi, L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566672\nNovel synthetic opioids (NSOs), including both fentanyl and non-fentanyl analogs that act as the -opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, are associated with serious intoxication and fatal overdose. Previous studies proposed that G protein biased MOR agonists are safer pain medications, while other evidence indicates that low intrinsic efficacy at MOR better explains reduced opioid side effects. Here, we characterized the in vitro functional profiles of various NSOs at MOR using adenylate cyclase inhibition and {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment assays, in conjunction with the application of the receptor depletion approach. By fitting the concentration-response data to the operational model of agonism, we deduced the intrinsic efficacy and affinity for each opioid in the Gi protein signaling and {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment pathways. Compared to the reference agonist DAMGO, we found that several fentanyl analogs were more efficacious at inhibiting cAMP production, whereas all fentanyl analogs were less efficacious at recruiting {beta}-arrestin2. In contrast, the non-fentanyl 2-benzylbenzimidazole (i.e., nitazene) analogs were highly efficacious and potent in both the cAMP and {beta}-arrestin2 assays. Our findings suggest that the high intrinsic efficacy of the NSOs in Gi protein signaling is a common property that may underlie their high risk of intoxication and overdose, highlighting the limitation of using in vitro functional bias to predict the adverse effects of opioids. Instead, our results show that, regardless of bias, opioids with sufficiently high intrinsic efficacy can be lethal, especially given the extremely high potency of many of these compounds that are now pervading the illicit drug market.\nSingle-molecule tracking-based drug screening\nAuthors: Watanabe, D.; Hiroshima, M.; Ueda, M.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566743\nThe single-molecule tracking of transmembrane receptors in living cells has provided significant insights into signaling mechanisms, such as mobility and clustering upon their activation/inactivation, making it a potential screening method for drug discovery. Using an automated system for large-scale single-molecule analysis, we screened for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from 1,134 of FDA approved drugs. Included in the hit 18 compounds covered all EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the library that suppressed phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of EGFR, proving the concept of this approach. The remaining hit compounds are not reported as EGFR-targeted drugs and affected the mobility and/or clustering of EGFR to modulate downstream signaling. Thus, single-molecule tracking provides a new modality for discovering novel therapeutics on various receptor functions with previously untargeted mechanisms.\nImpulse initiation in engrafted pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can stimulate the recipient heart.\nAuthors: Stuedemann, T.; Schwarzova, B.; Schneidewind, T.; Geertz, B.; von Bibra, C.; Nehring, M.; Roessinger, J.; Wiegert, J. S.; Eschenhagen, T.; Weinberger, F.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.566756\nTransplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is a novel promising cell-based therapeutic approach for patients with heart failure. However, engraftment arrhythmias are a predictable life-threatening complication and represent a major hurdle for clinical translation. Catheter-based electrophysiological analysis suggested that the ventricular arrhythmias were caused by an automaticity of the transplanted cells, but whether impulse generation by transplanted cardiomyocytes can propagate to the host myocardium and override the recipient rhythm has not been directly assessed experimentally. We used optogenetics to specifically activate engrafted cardiomyocytes, which resulted in impulse generation in the engrafted cardiomyocytes and stimulated the recipient heart (4/9 hearts). Thus, our study shows that transplanted cardiomyocytes can electrically couple to the host myocardium and stimulate the recipient heart, providing experimental evidence that cardiomyocyte automaticity can serve as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias.\nModification of the antibiotic, colistin, with dextrin causes enhanced cytotoxicity and triggers apoptosis in myeloid leukemia\nAuthors: Rizzo, S.; Varache, M.; Sayers, E. J.; Jones, A. T.; Tonks, A.; Thomas, D. W.; Ferguson, E. L.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.565276\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains difficult to treat due to its heterogeneity in molecular landscape, epigenetics and cell signaling alterations. Precision medicine is a major goal in AML therapy towards developing agents that can be used to treat patients with different subtypes in combination with current chemotherapies. We have previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates to combat the rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections and overcome dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Recent evidence of colistins anticancer activity, mediated through inhibition of intracellular lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A), suggests that dextrin-colistin conjugates could be used to treat cancer cells, including AML. This study aimed to evaluate whether dextrin conjugation (which reduces in vivo toxicity and prolongs plasma half-life) could enhance colistins cytotoxic effects in myeloid leukemia cell lines and compare the intracellular uptake and localization of the free and conjugated antibiotic. Our results identified a conjugate (containing 8,000 g/mol dextrin with 1 mol% succinoylation) that caused significantly increased toxicity in myeloid leukemia cells, compared to free colistin. Dextrin conjugation altered the mechanism of cell death by colistin, from necrosis to caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, conjugation via a reversible ester linker, instead of an amide, had no effect on the mechanism of the colistin-induced cell death. Live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently-labelled compounds showed both free and dextrin-conjugated colistin were endocytosed and co-localized in lysosomes and increasing the degree of modification by succinoylation of dextrin significantly reduced colistin internalization. Whilst clinical translation of dextrin-colistin conjugates for the treatment of AML is unlikely due to the potential to promote AMR and the relatively high colistin concentrations required for anticancer activity, the ability to potentiate the effectiveness of an anticancer drug by polymer conjugation, while reducing side effects and improving biodistribution of the drug, is very attractive, and this approach warrants further investigation.

M.; Russo, M.; Rosapane, M.; Tosti, E.; Russo, G. L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.567676\nThe last decades have seen an increase in the isolation and characterization of anticancer compounds derived from marine organisms, especially invertebrates, and their use in clinical trials. In this regard, ascidians, which are included in the subphylum Tunicata, represent successful examples with two drugs, Aplidine(C) and Yondelis(C), that reached the market as orphan drugs against several malignancies. Here, we report that an organic extract prepared from homogenized tissues of the Mediterranean ascidian Ciona robusta inhibited cell proliferation in HT-29, Hep G2, and U2 OS human cells with the former resulting as the most sensitive to the extract (EC50 = 250 g/ml). We demonstrated that the ascidian organic extract was not cytotoxic on HT-29 cells induced to differentiate with sodium butyrate, suggesting a preference for the mixture for the malignant phenotype. Finally, we reported that the cell death induced by the organic extract was mediated by the activation of a process of cytotoxic autophagy as a result of the increased expression of the LC3-II marker and the number of autophagic vacuoles, which almost doubled in treated HT-29 cells. In summary, although the detailed chemical composition of the Ciona robusta extract is still undetermined, our data suggest the presence in it of bioactive compounds possessing anticancer activity\nhURAT1 Transgenic Mouse Model for Evaluating Targeted Urate-Lowering Agents\nAuthors: De, G.; Cai, W.; Yang, M.; Zhao, Q.; Yi, G.; Lin, P.; Chen, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567192\nObjective: Urate transporter 1 (URAT1), a well-established urate-lowering therapeutic target for hyperuricemia and gout treatment, expresses in the kidney proximal tubule and is responsible for uric acid (UA) reabsorption. However, non-primate animal models currently used in pharmacological studies failed to evaluate URAT1 inhibitor's effectiveness because their URAT1 has a very low UA affinity compared to human URAT1, resulting in a lag in targeting drug screening and novel therapy development for gout treatment. We established a human URAT1 (hURAT1) transgenic knock-in (KI) mouse model to assess uricosuric agents' effectiveness and characterize URAT1-caused pathogenesis. Methods: We generated hURAT1 transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in technique. mUrat1 knockout was achieved by replacing exon 1 coding sequence with a human SLC22A12 CDS-pA cassette. Based on the above transgenic mice, a hyperuricemia model was further established by hypoxanthine administration. Results: The hURAT1-KI mice successfully expressed hURAT1 protein to the apical side of the kidney proximal tubule epithelium, where a native human URAT1 kidney localization in human body. Upon hypoxanthine challenge, the blood UA level was elevated in hURAT1-KI mice, exhibiting an approximately 37% increase compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The elevated blood UA level could be alleviated by hURAT1 inhibitor benzbromarone treatment in the hURAT1-KI mice whereas no response was observed in WT littermates. Therefore, hURAT1 transgenic mice responded well to inhibitors and can be used to evaluate the therapeutic effects. Conclusion: The hURAT1-KI hyperuricaemia mouse model would be valuable for preclinical evaluation of urate-lowering agents toward gout treatment and studying UA metabolic complexities in humans.\nLeukemia in Sprague-Dawley Rats Exposed Long-term from Prenatal Life to Glyphosate and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides\nAuthors: Panzacchi, S.; Tibaldi, E.; De Angelis, L.; Falcioni, L.; Gnudi, F.; Iuliani, M.; Manservigi, M.; Manservisi, F.; Manzoli, I.; Menghetti, I.; Montella, R.; Noferini, R.; Sgargi, D.; Strollo, V.; Antoniou, M.; Chen, J.; Dinelli, G.; Lorenzetti, S.; Mesnage, R.; Vornoli, A.; Perry, M. J.; Landrigan, P. J.; Belpoggi, F.; Mandrioli, D.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.566013\nBackground: Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world's most widely used weed control agents. There has been intense and increasing public health concern about glyphosate and GBHs since the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015. Aims: To further study the health effects of glyphosate and GBHs, the Ramazzini Institute, in collaboration with an international network of institutes and universities, has launched the Global Glyphosate Study (GGS), the most comprehensive toxicological study ever performed on these compounds. The GGS is an integrated study designed to test a wide range of toxicological outcomes including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, multi-generational effects, organ toxicity, endocrine disruption and prenatal developmental toxicity. The present study reports the first definitive results on leukemia incidence and mortality from the carcinogenicity arm of the GGS. Method: Glyphosate and two GBHs, Roundup Bioflow (MON 52276) used in the European Union (EU) and RangerPro (EPA 524-517) used in the U.S., were administered long-term to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats beginning in prenatal life until 104 weeks of age via drinking water at doses of 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg body weight/day. This dose range encompasses both the EU Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the EU No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for glyphosate. Each experimental group was composed of 51 males and 51 females, the total number animals were 1020 (510 males and 510 females). Results: In the animals exposed to glyphosate, a significantly increased trend in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia was observed in males. In the Roundup Bioflow-treated animals, significantly increased trends were observed in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia (males and females), monocytic leukemia (males), total myeloid leukemia (males), and all leukemias combined (males and females). In the RangerPro-treated animals, significantly increased trends were observed in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia (males and females), monocytic leukemia (males) and all leukemias combined (males). 43% of leukemias deaths in the glyphosate and GBHs treated groups occurred before the first year of age (52 weeks). Conclusions: Glyphosate and GBHs at exposure levels corresponding to the EU ADI and the EU NOAEL caused significant, dose-related increased trends in incidence of leukemia, a very rare malignancy, in SD rats. Notably, about half of the leukemia deaths seen in the glyphosate and GBH groups occurred at less than one year of age, comparable to less than 35-40 years of age in humans.\nThe effects of paroxetine-induced transient apoptosis and brain remodeling on social behavior in developing zebrafish\nAuthors: Sato, T.; Saito, K.; Oyu, T.; Tsuda, S.; Kurisaki, T.; Kajihara, T.; Nagashima, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566506\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition caused by various genetic and environmental factors. This disorder has the cardinal symptoms including impaired social behavior involving the amygdala. Antidepressants such as paroxetine in early pregnancy increase the risk of ASD in offspring. However, a comprehensive picture of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to paroxetine suppresses neurogenesis in the optic tectum and the dorsal telencephalon which corresponds to the human amygdala. Paroxetine-treated embryos exhibit impaired growth, with small heads and short body lengths resulting from transient apoptosis. This is reminiscent of the early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with ASD. Interestingly, the suppressed neurogenesis in the small heads was found to be restored after the cessation of paroxetine. This was accompanied by extended retinotectal projections, suggesting brain-preferential remodeling. Finally, the paroxetine-treated fish exhibited impaired social behavior, further supporting the correspondence with ASD. Our findings offer new insights into the early neurodevelopmental etiology of ASD.\nOral delivery of the amylin receptor agonist pramlintide\nAuthors: Sinezia, C.; Sisnande, T.; Icart, L.

T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566408\nAimThe aims of this study were to design and characterize polymeric microparticles for oral delivery of pramlintide, a triple proline human amylin analogue clinically proved efficient in diabetes therapy. MethodsThe microparticles were prepared with gastric-resistant polymer Eudragit S100 by double-emulsion and solvent evaporation technique. The study responses were repeatability, encapsulation efficiency, yield, morphology, particle size, response to acidic and alkaline milieu and pharmacokinetics. ResultsWe obtained spherical microcapsules, with particle size of 66 m {+/-} 11, with 83.2 % {+/-} 2.7 efficiency for pramlintide entrapment and 67.6 % {+/-} 2.1 yield. Intra-venous pramlintide free in solution showed a plasmatic half-life of 6.8 min in mice. In contrast, oral delivery of acid-resistant pramlintide-loaded microparticles in mice showed a protracted release for 120 min compared to 30 min obtained for pramlintide in solution. ConclusionsOral route is an alternative for therapeutic development of pramlintide formulations.

        <p class="abstract">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) administered intranasally as dry powders can be potentially applied for the treatment or pre-exposure prevention of viral infections in the upper respiratory tract. However, a method to transform the mAbs from liquid to dry powders suitable for intranasal administration and a device that can spray the dry powders to the desired region of the nasal cavity are needed to fully realize the potentials of the mAbs. Herein, we report that thin-film freeze-drying can be applied to prepare aerosolizable mAb dry powders and that the dry powders can be sprayed into the posterior nasal cavity using Aptar Pharmas Unidose (UDS) Powder Nasal Spray System. AUG-3387, a human-derived mAb that neutralizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was used in the present study. First, we prepared AUG-3387 thin-film freeze-dried powders (i.e., TFF AUG-3387 powders) from liquid formulations containing different levels of mAbs. The TFF AUG-3387 powder with the highest solid content (i.e., TFF AUG-3387C powder) was then chosen for further characterization, including the evaluation of the plume geometry, spray pattern, and particle size distribution after the powder was sprayed using the UDS Powder device. Finally, the deposition patterns of the TFF AUG-3387C powder sprayed using the UDS Powder device were studied using 3D-printed nasal replica casts based on an adult model and a child model. It is concluded that it is feasible to intranasally deliver mAbs as dry powders by transforming the mAbs into dry powders using thin-film freeze-drying and then spray the powder using the UDS Powder device.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Novel synthetic opioids (NSOs), including both fentanyl and non-fentanyl analogs that act as the -opioid receptor (MOR) agonists, are associated with serious intoxication and fatal overdose. Previous studies proposed that G protein biased MOR agonists are safer pain medications, while other evidence indicates that low intrinsic efficacy at MOR better explains reduced opioid side effects. Here, we characterized the in vitro functional profiles of various NSOs at MOR using adenylate cyclase inhibition and {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment assays, in conjunction with the application of the receptor depletion approach. By fitting the concentration-response data to the operational model of agonism, we deduced the intrinsic efficacy and affinity for each opioid in the Gi protein signaling and {beta}-arrestin2 recruitment pathways. Compared to the reference agonist DAMGO, we found that several fentanyl analogs were more efficacious at inhibiting cAMP production, whereas all fentanyl analogs were less efficacious at recruiting {beta}-arrestin2. In contrast, the non-fentanyl 2-benzylbenzimidazole (i.e., nitazene) analogs were highly efficacious and potent in both the cAMP and {beta}-arrestin2 assays. Our findings suggest that the high intrinsic efficacy of the NSOs in Gi protein signaling is a common property that may underlie their high risk of intoxication and overdose, highlighting the limitation of using in vitro functional bias to predict the adverse effects of opioids. Instead, our results show that, regardless of bias, opioids with sufficiently high intrinsic efficacy can be lethal, especially given the extremely high potency of many of these compounds that are now pervading the illicit drug market.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The single-molecule tracking of transmembrane receptors in living cells has provided significant insights into signaling mechanisms, such as mobility and clustering upon their activation/inactivation, making it a potential screening method for drug discovery. Using an automated system for large-scale single-molecule analysis, we screened for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from 1,134 of FDA approved drugs. Included in the hit 18 compounds covered all EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the library that suppressed phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of EGFR, proving the concept of this approach. The remaining hit compounds are not reported as EGFR-targeted drugs and affected the mobility and/or clustering of EGFR to modulate downstream signaling. Thus, single-molecule tracking provides a new modality for discovering novel therapeutics on various receptor functions with previously untargeted mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is a novel promising cell-based therapeutic approach for patients with heart failure. However, engraftment arrhythmias are a predictable life-threatening complication and represent a major hurdle for clinical translation. Catheter-based electrophysiological analysis suggested that the ventricular arrhythmias were caused by an automaticity of the transplanted cells, but whether impulse generation by transplanted cardiomyocytes can propagate to the host myocardium and override the recipient rhythm has not been directly assessed experimentally. We used optogenetics to specifically activate engrafted cardiomyocytes, which resulted in impulse generation in the engrafted cardiomyocytes and stimulated the recipient heart (4/9 hearts). Thus, our study shows that transplanted cardiomyocytes can electrically couple to the host myocardium and stimulate the recipient heart, providing experimental evidence that cardiomyocyte automaticity can serve as a trigger for ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains difficult to treat due to its heterogeneity in molecular landscape, epigenetics and cell signaling alterations. Precision medicine is a major goal in AML therapy towards developing agents that can be used to treat patients with different  subtypes in combination with current chemotherapies. We have previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates to combat the rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections and overcome dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Recent evidence of colistins anticancer activity, mediated through inhibition of intracellular lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A), suggests that dextrin-colistin conjugates could be used to treat cancer cells, including AML. This study aimed to evaluate whether dextrin conjugation (which reduces in vivo toxicity and prolongs plasma half-life) could enhance colistins cytotoxic effects in myeloid leukemia cell lines and compare the intracellular uptake and localization of the free and conjugated antibiotic. Our results identified a conjugate (containing 8,000 g/mol dextrin with 1 mol% succinoylation) that caused significantly increased toxicity in myeloid leukemia cells, compared to free colistin. Dextrin conjugation altered the mechanism of cell death by colistin, from necrosis to caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, conjugation via a reversible ester linker, instead of an amide, had no effect on the mechanism of the colistin-induced cell death. Live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently-labelled compounds showed both free and dextrin-conjugated colistin were endocytosed and co-localized in lysosomes and increasing the degree of modification by succinoylation of dextrin significantly reduced colistin internalization. Whilst clinical translation of dextrin-colistin conjugates for the treatment of AML is unlikely due to the potential to promote AMR and the relatively high colistin concentrations required for anticancer activity, the ability to potentiate the effectiveness of an anticancer drug by polymer conjugation, while reducing side effects and improving biodistribution of the drug, is very attractive, and this approach warrants further investigation.

        <p class="abstract">The last decades have seen an increase in the isolation and characterization of anticancer compounds derived from marine organisms, especially invertebrates, and their use in clinical trials. In this regard, ascidians, which are included in the subphylum Tunicata, represent successful examples with two drugs, Aplidine(C) and Yondelis(C), that reached the market as orphan drugs against several malignancies. Here, we report that an organic extract prepared from homogenized tissues of the Mediterranean ascidian Ciona robusta inhibited cell proliferation in HT-29, Hep G2, and U2 OS human cells with the former resulting as the most sensitive to the extract (EC50 = 250 g/ml). We demonstrated that the ascidian organic extract was not cytotoxic on HT-29 cells induced to differentiate with sodium butyrate, suggesting a preference for the mixture for the malignant phenotype. Finally, we reported that the cell death induced by the organic extract was mediated by the activation of a process of cytotoxic autophagy as a result of the increased expression of the LC3-II marker and the number of autophagic vacuoles, which almost doubled in treated HT-29 cells. In summary, although the detailed chemical composition of the Ciona robusta extract is still undetermined, our data suggest the presence in it of bioactive compounds possessing anticancer activity</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Urate transporter 1 (URAT1), a well-established urate-lowering therapeutic target for hyperuricemia and gout treatment, expresses in the kidney proximal tubule and is responsible for uric acid (UA) reabsorption. However, non-primate animal models currently used in pharmacological studies failed to evaluate URAT1 inhibitor&#39;s effectiveness because their URAT1 has a very low UA affinity compared to human URAT1, resulting in a lag in targeting drug screening and novel therapy development for gout treatment. We established a human URAT1 (hURAT1) transgenic knock-in (KI) mouse model to assess uricosuric agents&#39; effectiveness and characterize URAT1-caused pathogenesis. Methods: We generated hURAT1 transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in technique. mUrat1 knockout was achieved by replacing exon 1 coding sequence with a human SLC22A12 CDS-pA cassette. Based on the above transgenic mice, a hyperuricemia model was further established by hypoxanthine administration. Results: The hURAT1-KI mice successfully expressed hURAT1 protein to the apical side of the kidney proximal tubule epithelium, where a native human URAT1 kidney localization in human body. Upon hypoxanthine challenge, the blood UA level was elevated in hURAT1-KI mice, exhibiting an approximately 37% increase compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The elevated blood UA level could be alleviated by hURAT1 inhibitor benzbromarone treatment in the hURAT1-KI mice whereas no response was observed in WT littermates. Therefore, hURAT1 transgenic mice responded well to inhibitors and can be used to evaluate the therapeutic effects. Conclusion: The hURAT1-KI hyperuricaemia mouse model would be valuable for preclinical evaluation of urate-lowering agents toward gout treatment and studying UA metabolic complexities in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the world&#39;s most widely used weed control agents. There has been intense and increasing public health concern about glyphosate and GBHs since the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015. Aims: To further study the health effects of glyphosate and GBHs, the Ramazzini Institute, in collaboration with an international network of institutes and universities, has launched the Global Glyphosate Study (GGS), the most comprehensive toxicological study ever performed on these compounds. The GGS is an integrated study designed to test a wide range of toxicological outcomes including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, multi-generational effects, organ toxicity, endocrine disruption and prenatal developmental toxicity. The present study reports the first definitive results on leukemia incidence and mortality from the carcinogenicity arm of the GGS. Method: Glyphosate and two GBHs, Roundup Bioflow (MON 52276) used in the European Union (EU) and RangerPro (EPA 524-517) used in the U.S., were administered long-term to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats beginning in prenatal life until 104 weeks of age via drinking water at doses of 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg body weight/day. This dose range encompasses both the EU Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and the EU No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for glyphosate. Each experimental group was composed of 51 males and 51 females, the total number animals were 1020 (510 males and 510 females). Results: In the animals exposed to glyphosate, a significantly increased trend in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia was observed in males. In the Roundup Bioflow-treated animals, significantly increased trends were observed in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia (males and females), monocytic leukemia (males), total myeloid leukemia (males), and all leukemias combined (males and females). In the RangerPro-treated animals, significantly increased trends were observed in incidence of lymphoblastic leukemia (males and females), monocytic leukemia (males) and all leukemias combined (males). 43% of leukemias deaths in the glyphosate and GBHs treated groups occurred before the first year of age (52 weeks). Conclusions: Glyphosate and GBHs at exposure levels corresponding to the EU ADI and the EU NOAEL caused significant, dose-related increased trends in incidence of leukemia, a very rare malignancy, in SD rats. Notably, about half of the leukemia deaths seen in the glyphosate and GBH groups occurred at less than one year of age, comparable to less than 35-40 years of age in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition caused by various genetic and environmental factors. This disorder has the cardinal symptoms including impaired social behavior involving the amygdala. Antidepressants such as paroxetine in early pregnancy increase the risk of ASD in offspring. However, a comprehensive picture of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to paroxetine suppresses neurogenesis in the optic tectum and the dorsal telencephalon which corresponds to the human amygdala. Paroxetine-treated embryos exhibit impaired growth, with small heads and short body lengths resulting from transient apoptosis. This is reminiscent of the early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with ASD. Interestingly, the suppressed neurogenesis in the small heads was found to be restored after the cessation of paroxetine. This was accompanied by extended retinotectal projections, suggesting brain-preferential remodeling. Finally, the paroxetine-treated fish exhibited impaired social behavior, further supporting the correspondence with ASD. Our findings offer new insights into the early neurodevelopmental etiology of ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimThe aims of this study were to design and characterize polymeric microparticles for oral delivery of pramlintide, a triple proline human amylin analogue clinically proved efficient in diabetes therapy.

MethodsThe microparticles were prepared with gastric-resistant polymer Eudragit S100 by double-emulsion and solvent evaporation technique. The study responses were repeatability, encapsulation efficiency, yield, morphology, particle size, response to acidic and alkaline milieu and pharmacokinetics.

ResultsWe obtained spherical microcapsules, with particle size of 66 m {&#43;/-} 11, with 83.2 % {&#43;/-} 2.7 efficiency for pramlintide entrapment and 67.6 % {&#43;/-} 2.1 yield. Intra-venous pramlintide free in solution showed a plasmatic half-life of 6.8 min in mice. In contrast, oral delivery of acid-resistant pramlintide-loaded microparticles in mice showed a protracted release for 120 min compared to 30 min obtained for pramlintide in solution.

ConclusionsOral route is an alternative for therapeutic development of pramlintide formulations.
