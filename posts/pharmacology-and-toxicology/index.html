H.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549222\nActin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.\nTranscriptomic Effects of Low-Dose Inorganic Arsenic Exposure on Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages.\nAuthors: Illingworth, E. J.; Maertens, A.; Sille, F. C. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550543\nBoth tissue-resident macrophages and monocytes recruited from the bone marrow that transform into tissue-resident cells play critical roles in mediating homeostasis as well as in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the most common drinking water contaminant worldwide and represents a major public health concern. Several diseases that macrophages have implicated involvement in are caused by iAs exposure, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and increased risk of infectious disease. Therefore, understanding the effects of iAs exposure on macrophages can help us better grasp the full range of arsenic immunotoxicity and better design therapeutic targets for iAs-induced diseases particularly in exposed populations. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of low dose iAs-exposed male and female murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either M0, M1, or M2 stimulation. We identified differentially expressed genes by iAs in a sex- and stimulation-dependent manner and used bioinformatics tools to predict protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulatory networks, and associated biological processes. Overall, our data suggest that M1-stimulated, especially female-derived, BMDMs are most susceptible to iAs exposure. Most notably, we observed significant downregulation of major proinflammatory transcription factors, like IRF8, and its downstream targets, as well as genes encoding proteins involved in pattern recognition and antigen presentation, such as TLR7, TLR8, and H2-D1, potentially providing causal insight regarding arsenic's role in perturbing immune responses to infectious diseases. We also observed significant downregulation of genes involved in processes crucial to coordinating a proinflammatory response including leukocyte migration, differentiation, and cytokine and chemokine production and response. Finally, we discovered that 24 X-linked genes were dysregulated in iAs-exposed female stimulation groups compared to only 3 across the iAs-exposed male stimulation groups. These findings elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the sex-differential iAs-associated immune-related disease risk.\nNepicastat, a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor decreases blood pressure and induces the infiltration of macrophages and B cells in the heart of spontaneous hypertensive rats\nAuthors: Chandan, S.; Kosher, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.549206\nNepicastat is a potent dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor that modulates the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the synthesis of norepinephrine. Nepicastat is a potential drug for the treatment of congestive heart failure. We sought to investigate the mechanistic role of Nepicastsat in the heart of Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats (SHR) rats. Here, we investigated if Nepicastat at both acute (7 days) and chronic administration (14 days) decrease blood pressure and echocardiography parameters in SHR rats. SHR 3-4 months male rats were administered either Nepicastsat (30mg/kg, orally), Enalapril (10 mg/kg, orally), or vehicle for 7 days or 14 days. Blood pressure and echocardiography parameters were recorded on day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 14 of drug administration. The animals were sacrificed, and tissues are collected for histology, qRTPCR, and flow cytometry analysis. At both acute and chronic administration, Nepicastat decreased systolic blood pressure and intraventricular septal thickness of SHR rats compared to vehicle groups. The decrease in blood pressure was comparable to Enalapril treated rats. Interestingly, Nepicastat also decreased the infiltrating macrophages and B cells in the hearts of SHR rats. In conclusion, Nepicastsat consistently decreased the systolic blood pressure but increased the macrophages and B cell infiltration in the heart of SHR rats.\nNeuropathic pain has sex-specific effects on oxycodone seeking and drug-seeking ensembles in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex\nAuthors: Sarka, B. C.; Liu, S.; Banerjee, A.; Stucky, C. L.; Liu, Q.-s.; Olsen, C. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548045\nApproximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and opioids are commonly prescribed for such individuals. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drug-seeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury. HighlightsO_LIOxycodone seeking was higher in females following SNI that came after the 10-day SA timeline. C_LIO_LIAn increase in intrinsic excitability was detected among non-ensemble neurons from female mice that received SNI, and this correlated with an increase in seeking behavior.

J.; Smith, A. N.; Akers, W. S.; Cornea, R. L.; Laver, D. L.; Johnston, J. N.; Knollmann, B. C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547578\nCa2+ leak from cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an established mechanism of sudden cardiac death (SCD), whereby dysregulated Ca2+ handling causes ventricular arrhythmias. We previously discovered the RyR2-selective inhibitor ent-(+)-verticilide (ent-1), a 24-membered cyclooligomeric depsipeptide that is the enantiomeric form of a natural product (nat-(-)-verticilide). Here, we examined its 18-membered ring-size oligomer (ent-verticilide B1; \"ent-B1\") in single RyR2 channel assays, [3H]ryanodine binding assays, and in Casq2-/- cardiomyocytes and mice, a gene-targeted model of SCD. ent-B1 inhibited RyR2 single-channels and [3H]ryanodine binding with low micromolar potency, and RyR2-mediated spontaneous Ca release in Casq2-/-cardiomyocytes with sub-micromolar potency. Maximal inhibitory efficacy was less than 50% in all three assays. ent-B1 was stable in plasma, with a peak plasma concentration of 1460 ng/ml at 10 min and half-life of 45 min after intraperitoneal administration of 3 mg/kg in mice. Both 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg ent-B1 significantly reduced catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmia in Casq2-/-mice. Hence, we have identified a novel chemical entity - ent-B1 - that preserves the mechanism of action of a hit compound and shows therapeutic efficacy. These findings strengthen RyR2 as an antiarrhythmic drug target and highlight the potential of investigating the mirror-image isomers of natural products to discover new therapeutics. Significance statementThe cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an untapped target in the stagnant field of antiarrhythmic drug development. We have validated RyR2 as a target in a mouse model of sudden cardiac death and shown the therapeutic efficacy of a second enantiomeric natural product.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Both tissue-resident macrophages and monocytes recruited from the bone marrow that transform into tissue-resident cells play critical roles in mediating homeostasis as well as in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the most common drinking water contaminant worldwide and represents a major public health concern. Several diseases that macrophages have implicated involvement in are caused by iAs exposure, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and increased risk of infectious disease. Therefore, understanding the effects of iAs exposure on macrophages can help us better grasp the full range of arsenic immunotoxicity and better design therapeutic targets for iAs-induced diseases particularly in exposed populations. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of low dose iAs-exposed male and female murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either M0, M1, or M2 stimulation. We identified differentially expressed genes by iAs in a sex- and stimulation-dependent manner and used bioinformatics tools to predict protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulatory networks, and associated biological processes. Overall, our data suggest that M1-stimulated, especially female-derived, BMDMs are most susceptible to iAs exposure. Most notably, we observed significant downregulation of major proinflammatory transcription factors, like IRF8, and its downstream targets, as well as genes encoding proteins involved in pattern recognition and antigen presentation, such as TLR7, TLR8, and H2-D1, potentially providing causal insight regarding arsenic&#39;s role in perturbing immune responses to infectious diseases. We also observed significant downregulation of genes involved in processes crucial to coordinating a proinflammatory response including leukocyte migration, differentiation, and cytokine and chemokine production and response. Finally, we discovered that 24 X-linked genes were dysregulated in iAs-exposed female stimulation groups compared to only 3 across the iAs-exposed male stimulation groups. These findings elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the sex-differential iAs-associated immune-related disease risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nepicastat is a potent dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor that modulates the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the synthesis of norepinephrine. Nepicastat is a potential drug for the treatment of congestive heart failure. We sought to investigate the mechanistic role of Nepicastsat in the heart of Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats (SHR) rats. Here, we investigated if Nepicastat at both acute (7 days) and chronic administration (14 days) decrease blood pressure and echocardiography parameters in SHR rats. SHR 3-4 months male rats were administered either Nepicastsat (30mg/kg, orally), Enalapril (10 mg/kg, orally), or vehicle for 7 days or 14 days. Blood pressure and echocardiography parameters were recorded on day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 14 of drug administration. The animals were sacrificed, and tissues are collected for histology, qRTPCR, and flow cytometry analysis. At both acute and chronic administration, Nepicastat decreased systolic blood pressure and intraventricular septal thickness of SHR rats compared to vehicle groups. The decrease in blood pressure was comparable to Enalapril treated rats. Interestingly, Nepicastat also decreased the infiltrating macrophages and B cells in the hearts of SHR rats. In conclusion, Nepicastsat consistently decreased the systolic blood pressure but increased the macrophages and B cell infiltration in the heart of SHR rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and opioids are commonly prescribed for such individuals. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drug-seeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury.

HighlightsO_LIOxycodone seeking was higher in females following SNI that came after the 10-day SA timeline.
C_LIO_LIAn increase in intrinsic excitability was detected among non-ensemble neurons from female mice that received SNI, and this correlated with an increase in seeking behavior.

        <p class="abstract">Ca2&#43; leak from cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an established mechanism of sudden cardiac death (SCD), whereby dysregulated Ca2&#43; handling causes ventricular arrhythmias. We previously discovered the RyR2-selective inhibitor ent-(&#43;)-verticilide (ent-1), a 24-membered cyclooligomeric depsipeptide that is the enantiomeric form of a natural product (nat-(-)-verticilide). Here, we examined its 18-membered ring-size oligomer (ent-verticilide B1; &#34;ent-B1&#34;) in single RyR2 channel assays, [3H]ryanodine binding assays, and in Casq2-/- cardiomyocytes and mice, a gene-targeted model of SCD. ent-B1 inhibited RyR2 single-channels and [3H]ryanodine binding with low micromolar potency, and RyR2-mediated spontaneous Ca release in Casq2-/-cardiomyocytes with sub-micromolar potency. Maximal inhibitory efficacy was less than 50% in all three assays. ent-B1 was stable in plasma, with a peak plasma concentration of 1460 ng/ml at 10 min and half-life of 45 min after intraperitoneal administration of 3 mg/kg in mice. Both 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg ent-B1 significantly reduced catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmia in Casq2-/-mice. Hence, we have identified a novel chemical entity - ent-B1 - that preserves the mechanism of action of a hit compound and shows therapeutic efficacy. These findings strengthen RyR2 as an antiarrhythmic drug target and highlight the potential of investigating the mirror-image isomers of natural products to discover new therapeutics.

Significance statementThe cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an untapped target in the stagnant field of antiarrhythmic drug development. We have validated RyR2 as a target in a mouse model of sudden cardiac death and shown the therapeutic efficacy of a second enantiomeric natural product.</p>
