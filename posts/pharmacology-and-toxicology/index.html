L.; Barnard, I. L.; Finch, E.; McElroy, D. L.; Austin-Scott, F. V.; Greba, Q.; Michel, D.; Zagzoog, A.; Howland, J. G.; Laprairie, R. B.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545309\nCannabis sativa has gained popularity as a \"natural substance\", leading many to falsely assume that it is not harmful. This assumption has been documented amongst pregnant mothers, many of whom consider Cannabis use during pregnancy as benign. The purpose of this study was to validate a Cannabis smoke exposure model in pregnant rats by determining the plasma levels of cannabinoids and associated metabolites in the dams after exposure to either Cannabis smoke or injected cannabinoids. Maternal and fetal cytokine and chemokine profiles were also assessed after exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated daily from gestational day 6 - 20 with either room air, i.p. vehicle, inhaled high-{Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (17.98% THC, 0.1% cannabidiol [CBD]) smoke, inhaled high-CBD (0.1% THC, 12.83% CBD) smoke, 3 mg/kg i.p. THC, or 10 mg/kg i.p. CBD. Our data reveal that THC and CBD, but not their metabolites, accumulate in maternal plasma after repeated exposures. Injection of THC or CBD was associated with fewer offspring and increased uterine reabsorption events. For cytokines and chemokines, injection of THC or CBD up-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to control or high-THC smoke or high-CBD smoke in placental and fetal brain tissue, whereas smoke exposure was generally associated with reduced cytokine and chemokine concentrations in placental and fetal brain tissue compared to controls. These results support existing, but limited, knowledge on how different routes of administration contribute to inconsistent manifestations of cannabinoid-mediated effects on pregnancy. Smoked Cannabis is still the most common means of human consumption, and more preclinical investigation is needed to determine the effects of smoke inhalation on developmental and behavioural trajectories.\nSystematic Characterization of LSD metabolites in C. elegans by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry\nAuthors: Silveira, C. M. d. V.; dos Santos, V. F.; Ornelas, I. M.; Carrilho, B. d. S.; Ventura, M. A. V. d. C.; Pereira, H. M. G.; Rehen, S. K.; Junqueira, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545563\nPsychedelic compounds have gained renewed interest for their potential therapeutic applications, but their metabolism and effects on complex biological systems remain poorly understood. Here, we present a systematic characterization of LSD metabolites in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. By employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), we identified and quantified a range of LSD metabolites, shedding light on their metabolic pathways and offering insights into their pharmacokinetics. Our study demonstrates the suitability of C. elegans as a valuable model system for investigating the metabolism of psychedelic compounds and provides a foundation for further research on the therapeutic potential of LSD. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and highlight the importance of advanced analytical methodologies in elucidating the effects of psychedelic substances on biological systems.\nSperm Toolbox - A selection of small molecules to study human spermatozoa\nAuthors: Gruber, F. S.; Richardson, A.; Johnston, Z. C.; Myles, R.; Norcross, N.; Day, D.; Georgiou, I.; Sesma Sanz, L.; Wilson, C.; Read, K. D.; Martins da Silva, S.; Barratt, C. L.; Gilbert, I. H.; Swedlow, J. R.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.02.539126\nMale contraceptive options and infertility treatments are limited. To help overcome these limitations we established a small molecule library as a toolbox for assay development and screening campaigns using human spermatozoa. We have profiled all compounds in our automated high-throughput screening platform and provide the dataset, which allows direct side-by-side comparisons of compound effects and assays using live human spermatozoa.\nLarvicidal activity of the photosensitive insecticides, methylene blue and rose bengal, in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes\nAuthors: Meier, C. J.; Hillyer, J. F.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547250\nBACKGROUND: Insecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules-here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs-that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTS: MB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti. CONCLUSION: MB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.\nSafety Assessment and Evaluation of Novel Thiourea Derivatives as Antivirals\nAuthors: Kumar, J.; Tyagi, P.; saini, a. k.; Sharma, D.; Kumar, V.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546447\nDSA-00 and its two derivatives (DSA-02 \u0026 DSA-09) are new thiourea derivatives that exhibit strong antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus comparable to Entecavir. Here these compounds were evaluated for in-vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and in vivo acute toxicity for their potential therapeutic use. The cytotoxicity of thiourea derivatives was assessed in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells by MTT assay whereas their genotoxicity was measured by Ames II test. The acute toxicity study was carried out in the Sprague-Dawley rats by observing the following parameters: mortality, clinical symptoms, hematological parameters, urine and changes in animal body \u0026 organs weight, gross necropsy and histopathology. DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 were non-cytotoxic even at the 320M concentration with respective CC50 values of 329.6, 323.5, and 349.7 M. The Ames II test revealed that these molecules were non-mutagenic at a [~]1M concentration. The acute toxicity studies revealed LD50 values belong from the moderate range of toxicity of DSA-00, DSA-02 and DSA-09. Importantly, there were no abnormal change in body weight and organs weight. Moreover, no abnormal clinical signs such as hematological parameter, urinalysis, gross necropsy and or histopathological in any of the animals after receiving oral doses of thiourea derivatives. Thiourea derivatives DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 appear to have a moderate range of acute toxicity at dosages used and thus, appear to be generally safe.

K.; Jennings, C.; Ali, M.; Park, H.; Englund, K.; Khorana, A. A.; Svensson, L.; Kapadia, S. R.; McCrae, K. R.; Cameron, S. J.\nScore: 57.2, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.18.545507\nObjectivePost-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, also referred as Long-COVID) sometimes follows COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, and especially to activate platelets acutely, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC. Approach and ResultsPASC patients and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under venous shear stress conditions. While only a mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was markedly decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under venous shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed using age- and sex-matched platelets from healthy individuals. ConclusionsPASC patients demonstrate dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating plasma-derived molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic compounds have gained renewed interest for their potential therapeutic applications, but their metabolism and effects on complex biological systems remain poorly understood. Here, we present a systematic characterization of LSD metabolites in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. By employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), we identified and quantified a range of LSD metabolites, shedding light on their metabolic pathways and offering insights into their pharmacokinetics. Our study demonstrates the suitability of C. elegans as a valuable model system for investigating the metabolism of psychedelic compounds and provides a foundation for further research on the therapeutic potential of LSD. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and highlight the importance of advanced analytical methodologies in elucidating the effects of psychedelic substances on biological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Insecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules-here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs-that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTS: MB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti. CONCLUSION: MB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DSA-00 and its two derivatives (DSA-02 &amp; DSA-09) are new thiourea derivatives that exhibit strong antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus comparable to Entecavir. Here these compounds were evaluated for in-vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and in vivo acute toxicity for their potential therapeutic use. The cytotoxicity of thiourea derivatives was assessed in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells by MTT assay whereas their genotoxicity was measured by Ames II test. The acute toxicity study was carried out in the Sprague-Dawley rats by observing the following parameters: mortality, clinical symptoms, hematological parameters, urine and changes in animal body &amp; organs weight, gross necropsy and histopathology. DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 were non-cytotoxic even at the 320M concentration with respective CC50 values of 329.6, 323.5, and 349.7 M. The Ames II test revealed that these molecules were non-mutagenic at a [~]1M concentration. The acute toxicity studies revealed LD50 values belong from the moderate range of toxicity of DSA-00, DSA-02 and DSA-09. Importantly, there were no abnormal change in body weight and organs weight. Moreover, no abnormal clinical signs such as hematological parameter, urinalysis, gross necropsy and or histopathological in any of the animals after receiving oral doses of thiourea derivatives. Thiourea derivatives DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 appear to have a moderate range of acute toxicity at dosages used and thus, appear to be generally safe.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivePost-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, also referred as Long-COVID) sometimes follows COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, and especially to activate platelets acutely, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC.

Approach and ResultsPASC patients and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under venous shear stress conditions. While only a mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was markedly decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under venous shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed using age- and sex-matched platelets from healthy individuals.

ConclusionsPASC patients demonstrate dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating plasma-derived molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
