Since these diseases target the most vulnerable communities who are disadvantaged by health and socio-economic factors, new agents should be, if possible, easy-to-prepare to allow for commercialization based on their low cost. In this study, we show that simple modification of one of the most well-known antifungal drugs, fluconazole, with organometallic moieties not only improves the activity of the parent drug but also broadens the scope of application of the new derivatives. These compounds were highly effective in vivo against pathogenic fungal infections and potent against parasitic worms such as Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally. Notably, the identified molecular targets indicate a mechanism of action that differs greatly from the parental antifungal drug, including targets involved in biosynthetic pathways that are absent in humans, offering great potential to expand our armamentarium against drug-resistant fungal infections and NTDs targeted for elimination by 2030. Overall, the discovery of these new compounds with broad-spectrum activity opens new avenues for the development of treatments for several current human infections, either caused by fungi or by parasites, including other NTDs, as well as newly emerging diseases. ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYSimple derivatives of the well-known antifungal drug fluconazole were found to be highly effective in vivo against fungal infections, and also potent against the parasitic nematode Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and against Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally.\nSCA44- and SCAR13-associated GRM1 mutations affect metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 function through distinct mechanisms\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Muraleetharan, A.; Gregory, K. J.; Hellyer, S. D.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.545810\nMetabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative CNS disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Clinical reports have identified naturally-occurring mGlu1 mutations in rare SCA subtypes and clinical symptoms of mGlu1 mutations have been described. However, how mutations alter mGlu1 function remains unknown. We explored SCA-associated mutation effects on mGlu1 cell surface expression and canonical signal transduction. Orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) were assessed at two functional endpoints (iCa2+ mobilisation and IP1 accumulation). mGlu1 mutants exhibited differential impacts on receptor expression, with a truncating C-terminus mutation significantly reducing mGlu1 expression. Mutations differentially influenced orthosteric ligand affinity, efficacy, and functional cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Loss-of-function mutations L454F and N885del reduced orthosteric affinity and efficacy, respectively. Gain-of-function Y792C mutant mGlu1 displayed enhanced constitutive activity in IP1 assays, which manifested as reduced orthosteric agonist activity. mGlu1 PAMs restored glutamate potency in iCa2+ mobilisation for loss-of-function mutations, and mGlu1 NAMs displayed enhanced inverse agonist activity at Y792C relative to wild-type mGlu1. Collectively, these data highlight distinct mechanisms by which mGlu1 mutations affect receptor function and show allosteric modulators may present a means to restore aberrant mGlu1 function in rare SCA subtypes.\nStructural and Biological Evaluations of a Non-Nucleoside STING Agonist Specific for Human STING-A230 Variants\nAuthors: Tang, Z.; Zhao, J.; Li, Y.; Tomer, S.; Selvaraju, M.; Tien, N.; Sun, D.; Johnson, D. K.; Zhen, A.; Li, P.; Wang, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547363\nPreviously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STINGA230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STINGA230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 [A] resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2,3-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compounds activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STINGA230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STINGA230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macro-phages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.\nThe CB1 Negative Allosteric Modulator PSNCBAM-1 Reduces Ethanol Self-Administration via a Nonspecific Hypophagic Effect\nAuthors: Buechler, H. M.; Sumi, M.; Madhurathakam, I. M.; Donegan, C.; DiGiorgio, F.; Acosta, A.; Uribe, S.; Rahman, M. A.; Sorbello, A.; Fischer, B. D.; Keck, T. M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547272\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 15 million people in the United States. Current pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD are only modestly effective, necessitating the identification of new targets for medications development. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been a target of interest for the development of medications for substance use disorders and other compulsive disorders. However, CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have severe side effects that limit their clinical utility, including anxiety, depression, and suicide. Recent development of CB1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), including PSNCBAM-1, may provide an alternative mechanism of attenuating CB1 signaling with reduced side effects. PSNCBAM-1 has not yet been evaluated for effects in models of AUD. In this study, we investigated the effects of the CB1 NAM, PSNCBAM-1, in rodent models of AUD using adult male mice. PSNCBAM-1 dose-dependently attenuated oral ethanol self-administration (8% w/v ethanol in water), significantly reducing ethanol rewards at a dose of 30 mg/kg, but not at 10 or 18 mg/kg. PSNCBAM-1 also dose-dependently attenuated palatable food self-administration (diluted vanilla Ensure), significantly reducing food rewards at 18 and 30 mg/kg PSNCBAM-1. PSNCBAM-1 did not affect conditioned place preference for 2 g/kg ethanol. These results suggest PSNCBAM-1 reduces ethanol-taking behavior via a nonspecific hypophagic effect and does not reduce the rewarding effects of ethanol.\nToxicogenomic analysis of the carcinogenic potential of plastic additives\nAuthors: Vincoff, S.; Schleupner, B.; Santos, J.; Morrison, M.; Zhang, N.; Dunphy-Daly, M. M.; Eward, W. C.; Armstrong, A. J.; Diana, Z.; Somarelli, J.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547246\nPlastics are the most prevalent human-made substance in the world and are ubiquitous throughout all ecosystems. Microscopic plastic particles are routinely ingested and inhaled by humans and other organisms. Despite the frequency of plastic exposures, little is known about their health consequences. Of particular concern are plastic additives - chemical compounds that are mixed into plastics to improve functionality or are unintentionally acquired during plastic production and use. Additives are loosely bound to the plastic polymer and may be released during plastic exposures. These compounds may pose health concerns, such as cancer, but little is known about the potential impact of these chemicals on health. To better understand the health effects of plastic additives, we performed an integrated toxicogenomic analysis on 2,712 additives, focusing on cancer as a well-studied toxicological endpoint. Screening these substances across three chemical databases revealed two key observations: 1) over 150 plastic additives have known carcinogenicity and 2) the majority ([~]90%) of plastic additives lack data on carcinogenic endpoints. Analyses of additive usage patterns pinpointed specific polymers, functions, and products in which carcinogenic additives reside. Based on published chemical-gene interactions, both carcinogenic additives and additives with unknown carcinogenicity impacted similar biological pathways. The predominant pathways involved DNA damage, apoptosis, immune response, viral diseases, and cancer. This study underscores the urgent need for systematic and comprehensive carcinogenicity assessment of plastic additives and regulatory responses to mitigate the potential health risks of plastic exposure.\nLarvicidal activity of the photosensitive insecticides, methylene blue and rose bengal, in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes\nAuthors: Meier, C. J.; Hillyer, J. F.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547250\nBACKGROUNDInsecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules--here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs--that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTSMB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti. CONCLUSIONMB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.\n",

Since these diseases target the most vulnerable communities who are disadvantaged by health and socio-economic factors, new agents should be, if possible, easy-to-prepare to allow for commercialization based on their low cost. In this study, we show that simple modification of one of the most well-known antifungal drugs, fluconazole, with organometallic moieties not only improves the activity of the parent drug but also broadens the scope of application of the new derivatives. These compounds were highly effective in vivo against pathogenic fungal infections and potent against parasitic worms such as Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally. Notably, the identified molecular targets indicate a mechanism of action that differs greatly from the parental antifungal drug, including targets involved in biosynthetic pathways that are absent in humans, offering great potential to expand our armamentarium against drug-resistant fungal infections and NTDs targeted for elimination by 2030. Overall, the discovery of these new compounds with broad-spectrum activity opens new avenues for the development of treatments for several current human infections, either caused by fungi or by parasites, including other NTDs, as well as newly emerging diseases.

ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYSimple derivatives of the well-known antifungal drug fluconazole were found to be highly effective in vivo against fungal infections, and also potent against the parasitic nematode Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and against Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative CNS disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Clinical reports have identified naturally-occurring mGlu1 mutations in rare SCA subtypes and clinical symptoms of mGlu1 mutations have been described. However, how mutations alter mGlu1 function remains unknown. We explored SCA-associated mutation effects on mGlu1 cell surface expression and canonical signal transduction. Orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) were assessed at two functional endpoints (iCa2&#43; mobilisation and IP1 accumulation). mGlu1 mutants exhibited differential impacts on receptor expression, with a truncating C-terminus mutation significantly reducing mGlu1 expression. Mutations differentially influenced orthosteric ligand affinity, efficacy, and functional cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Loss-of-function mutations L454F and N885del reduced orthosteric affinity and efficacy, respectively. Gain-of-function Y792C mutant mGlu1 displayed enhanced constitutive activity in IP1 assays, which manifested as reduced orthosteric agonist activity. mGlu1 PAMs restored glutamate potency in iCa2&#43; mobilisation for loss-of-function mutations, and mGlu1 NAMs displayed enhanced inverse agonist activity at Y792C relative to wild-type mGlu1. Collectively, these data highlight distinct mechanisms by which mGlu1 mutations affect receptor function and show allosteric modulators may present a means to restore aberrant mGlu1 function in rare SCA subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STINGA230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STINGA230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 [A] resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2,3-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compounds activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STINGA230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STINGA230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macro-phages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 15 million people in the United States. Current pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD are only modestly effective, necessitating the identification of new targets for medications development. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been a target of interest for the development of medications for substance use disorders and other compulsive disorders. However, CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have severe side effects that limit their clinical utility, including anxiety, depression, and suicide. Recent development of CB1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), including PSNCBAM-1, may provide an alternative mechanism of attenuating CB1 signaling with reduced side effects. PSNCBAM-1 has not yet been evaluated for effects in models of AUD. In this study, we investigated the effects of the CB1 NAM, PSNCBAM-1, in rodent models of AUD using adult male mice. PSNCBAM-1 dose-dependently attenuated oral ethanol self-administration (8% w/v ethanol in water), significantly reducing ethanol rewards at a dose of 30 mg/kg, but not at 10 or 18 mg/kg. PSNCBAM-1 also dose-dependently attenuated palatable food self-administration (diluted vanilla Ensure), significantly reducing food rewards at 18 and 30 mg/kg PSNCBAM-1. PSNCBAM-1 did not affect conditioned place preference for 2 g/kg ethanol. These results suggest PSNCBAM-1 reduces ethanol-taking behavior via a nonspecific hypophagic effect and does not reduce the rewarding effects of ethanol.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plastics are the most prevalent human-made substance in the world and are ubiquitous throughout all ecosystems. Microscopic plastic particles are routinely ingested and inhaled by humans and other organisms. Despite the frequency of plastic exposures, little is known about their health consequences. Of particular concern are plastic additives - chemical compounds that are mixed into plastics to improve functionality or are unintentionally acquired during plastic production and use. Additives are loosely bound to the plastic polymer and may be released during plastic exposures. These compounds may pose health concerns, such as cancer, but little is known about the potential impact of these chemicals on health. To better understand the health effects of plastic additives, we performed an integrated toxicogenomic analysis on 2,712 additives, focusing on cancer as a well-studied toxicological endpoint. Screening these substances across three chemical databases revealed two key observations: 1) over 150 plastic additives have known carcinogenicity and 2) the majority ([~]90%) of plastic additives lack data on carcinogenic endpoints. Analyses of additive usage patterns pinpointed specific polymers, functions, and products in which carcinogenic additives reside. Based on published chemical-gene interactions, both carcinogenic additives and additives with unknown carcinogenicity impacted similar biological pathways. The predominant pathways involved DNA damage, apoptosis, immune response, viral diseases, and cancer. This study underscores the urgent need for systematic and comprehensive carcinogenicity assessment of plastic additives and regulatory responses to mitigate the potential health risks of plastic exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDInsecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules--here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs--that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage.

RESULTSMB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti.

CONCLUSIONMB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.</p>
