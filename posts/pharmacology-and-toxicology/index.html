L.; Yang, S.; Wacker, D.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556555\nThe human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1, hTA1) is a key regulator of monoaminergic neurotransmission and the actions of psychostimulants. Despite preclinical research demonstrating its tractability as a drug target, its molecular mechanisms of activation remain unclear. Moreover, poorly understood pharmacological differences between rodent and human TA1 complicate the translation of findings from preclinical disease models into novel pharmacotherapies. To elucidate hTA1s mechanisms on the molecular scale and investigate the underpinnings of its divergent pharmacology from rodent orthologs, we herein report the structure of the human TA1 receptor in complex with a Gs heterotrimer. Our structure reveals shared structural elements with other TAARs, as well as with its closest monoaminergic ortholog, the serotonin receptor 5-HT4R. We further find that a single mutation dramatically shifts the selectivity of hTA1 towards that of its rodent orthologs, and report on the effects of substituting residues to those found in serotonin and dopamine receptors. Strikingly, we also discover that the atypical antipsychotic medication and pan-monoaminergic antagonist asenapine potently and efficaciously activates hTA1. Together our studies provide detailed insight into hTA1 structure and function, contrast its molecular pharmacology with that of related receptors, and uncover off-target activities of monoaminergic drugs at hTA1.\nMachine Learning connects structure, bitterness \u0026 mechanism to antimalarial activity\nAuthors: Sambu, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556833\nMachine learning allows us to identify patterns we might otherwise have missed in the data. It therefore provides an ample solution to the age-old problem of lossless research. When the pattern is robust and the signal is durable, it is possible to use relatively modest amounts of data to build powerful well-learned models. By constructing a classifier using gradient-boosted machines, it was shown that the model was robust, yielded high quality metrics and demonstrated consistent probability assignments for chemistries that have a suitable chemical backbone qualified for inclusion in antiplasmodic libraries. Critical to model development was the utilization of molecular fingerprinting and extraction of physico-chemical parameters relevant to the mechanism driving antiplasmodic activity. Subsequently, such an approach allows the model to uncover the link between bitterness, molecular structure and therapeutic value. This approach to evaluating antiplasmodic activity in chemistries provides a low-cost tool usable in identifying new classes of molecules for use in reducing malaria morbidity that often affects vulnerable members of the community the most. Additionally, given their relatively broad, low colligation and potent efficacies, these molecules may provide strong safety margins and durability netting high returns for health equity.\nMeisoindigo: An Effective Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Revealed by Yeast System\nAuthors: Grabinski, W.; Kicinska, A.; Kosicka, E.; Baranek-Grabinska, M.; Hejenkowska, E. D.; Budzik, J.; Sliska, P.; Sliwinska, W.; Karachitos, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.555867\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARS- CoV-2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.\nVascular injury associated with ethanol intake is driven by AT1 receptor and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nAuthors: Awata, W. M. C.; Alves, J. V.; Costa, R. M.; Bruder-Nascimento, A.; Singh, S.; Barbosa, G. S.; Tirapelli, C. R.; Nascimento, T. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556341\nBackgroundRenin-angiotensin (Ang II)-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial for the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive ethanol consumption. Disturbs in mitochondria have been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, if mitochondria dysfunction contributes to ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated whether ethanol leads to vascular dysfunction via RAAS activation, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). MethodsMale C57/BL6J or mt-keima mice (6-8-weeks old) were treated with ethanol (20% vol./vol.) for 12 weeks with or without Losartan (10 mg/kg). ResultsEthanol induced aortic hypercontractility in an endothelium-dependent manner. PGC1 (a marker of biogenesis), Mfn2, (an essential protein for mitochondria fusion), as well as Pink-1 and Parkin (markers of mitophagy), were reduced in aortas from ethanol-treated mice. Disturb in mitophagy flux was further confirmed in arteries from mt-keima mice. Additionally, ethanol increased mtROS and reduced SOD2 expression. Strikingly, losartan prevented vascular hypercontractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and restored SOD2 expression. Both MnTMPyP (SOD2 mimetic) and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) reverted ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction. Moreover, L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) and EUK 134 (superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic) did not affect vascular response in ethanol group, suggesting that ethanol reduces aortic nitric oxide (NO) and H2O2 bioavailability. These responses were prevented by losartan. ConclusionAT1 receptor modulates ethanol-induced vascular hypercontractility by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and reduction of NO and H2O2 bioavailability. Our findings shed a new light in our understanding of ethanol-induced vascular toxicity and open perspectives of new therapeutic approaches for patients with disorder associated with abusive ethanol drinking.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARS- CoV-2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRenin-angiotensin (Ang II)-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial for the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive ethanol consumption. Disturbs in mitochondria have been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, if mitochondria dysfunction contributes to ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated whether ethanol leads to vascular dysfunction via RAAS activation, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS).

MethodsMale C57/BL6J or mt-keima mice (6-8-weeks old) were treated with ethanol (20% vol./vol.) for 12 weeks with or without Losartan (10 mg/kg).

ResultsEthanol induced aortic hypercontractility in an endothelium-dependent manner. PGC1 (a marker of biogenesis), Mfn2, (an essential protein for mitochondria fusion), as well as Pink-1 and Parkin (markers of mitophagy), were reduced in aortas from ethanol-treated mice. Disturb in mitophagy flux was further confirmed in arteries from mt-keima mice. Additionally, ethanol increased mtROS and reduced SOD2 expression. Strikingly, losartan prevented vascular hypercontractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and restored SOD2 expression. Both MnTMPyP (SOD2 mimetic) and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) reverted ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction. Moreover, L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) and EUK 134 (superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic) did not affect vascular response in ethanol group, suggesting that ethanol reduces aortic nitric oxide (NO) and H2O2 bioavailability. These responses were prevented by losartan.

ConclusionAT1 receptor modulates ethanol-induced vascular hypercontractility by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and reduction of NO and H2O2 bioavailability. Our findings shed a new light in our understanding of ethanol-induced vascular toxicity and open perspectives of new therapeutic approaches for patients with disorder associated with abusive ethanol drinking.</p>
