However, a method to transform the mAbs from liquid to dry powders suitable for intranasal administration and a device that can spray the dry powders to the desired region of the nasal cavity are needed to fully realize the potentials of the mAbs. Herein, we report that thin-film freeze-drying can be applied to prepare aerosolizable mAb dry powders and that the dry powders can be sprayed into the posterior nasal cavity using Aptar Pharmas Unidose (UDS) Powder Nasal Spray System. AUG-3387, a human-derived mAb that neutralizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was used in the present study. First, we prepared AUG-3387 thin-film freeze-dried powders (i.e., TFF AUG-3387 powders) from liquid formulations containing different levels of mAbs. The TFF AUG-3387 powder with the highest solid content (i.e., TFF AUG-3387C powder) was then chosen for further characterization, including the evaluation of the plume geometry, spray pattern, and particle size distribution after the powder was sprayed using the UDS Powder device. Finally, the deposition patterns of the TFF AUG-3387C powder sprayed using the UDS Powder device were studied using 3D-printed nasal replica casts based on an adult model and a child model. It is concluded that it is feasible to intranasally deliver mAbs as dry powders by transforming the mAbs into dry powders using thin-film freeze-drying and then spray the powder using the UDS Powder device.\nModification of the antibiotic, colistin, with dextrin causes enhanced cytotoxicity and triggers apoptosis in myeloid leukemia\nAuthors: Rizzo, S.; Varache, M.; Sayers, E. J.; Jones, A. T.; Tonks, A.; Thomas, D. W.; Ferguson, E. L.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.565276\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains difficult to treat due to its heterogeneity in molecular landscape, epigenetics and cell signaling alterations. Precision medicine is a major goal in AML therapy towards developing agents that can be used to treat patients with different 'subtypes' in combination with current chemotherapies. We have previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates to combat the rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections and overcome dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Recent evidence of colistin's anticancer activity, mediated through inhibition of intracellular lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A), suggests that dextrin-colistin conjugates could be used to treat cancer cells, including AML. This study aimed to evaluate whether dextrin conjugation (which reduces in vivo toxicity and prolongs plasma half-life) could enhance colistin's cytotoxic effects in myeloid leukemia cell lines and compare the intracellular uptake and localization of the free and conjugated antibiotic. Our results identified a conjugate (containing 8,000 g/mol dextrin with 1 mol% succinoylation) that caused significantly increased toxicity in myeloid leukemia cells, compared to free colistin. Dextrin conjugation altered the mechanism of cell death by colistin, from necrosis to caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, conjugation via a reversible ester linker, instead of an amide, had no effect on the mechanism of the colistin-induced cell death. Live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently-labelled compounds showed both free and dextrin-conjugated colistin were endocytosed and co-localized in lysosomes and increasing the degree of modification by succinoylation of dextrin significantly reduced colistin internalization. Whilst clinical translation of dextrin-colistin conjugates for the treatment of AML is unlikely due to the potential to promote AMR and the relatively high colistin concentrations required for anticancer activity, the ability to potentiate the effectiveness of an anticancer drug by polymer conjugation, while reducing side effects and improving biodistribution of the drug, is very attractive, and this approach warrants further investigation.\nAnti-cancer compound screening identifies Aurora Kinase A inhibition as a means to favor CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction over knock-out\nAuthors: Wilbie, D.; Eising, S.; Amo-Addae, V.; Walther, J.; Bosman, E.; de Jong, O. G.; Molenaar, J. J.; Mastrobattista, E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566375\nCRISPR gene therapy holds the potential to cure a variety of genetic diseases by targeting causative mutations and introducing double stranded DNA breaks, subsequently allowing the host DNA repair mechanisms to introduce mutations. One option to introduce precise gene corrections is via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. HDR can introduce a range of desired mutations dictated by a DNA template which holds a corrected DNA sequence which is written into the targeted gene. The problem in utilizing this pathway is that CRISPR-induced double stranded DNA breaks are repaired more often through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which does not use a designed template and introduces random DNA damage in the form of insertions and deletions at the cut site. Since HDR activation depends on many interconnected processes in the cell, we aimed to screen a small library of drug compounds in clinical use or clinical development for cancer, to steer the DNA repair process towards preferential HDR activation. We included compounds in our screen based on three relevant mechanisms in CRISPR gene editing: the cell cycle, DNA repair processing and chromosomal packing. We included forty compounds, based on these criteria, screened their toxicity and dosed them in sub-toxic concentrations in cells during genome editing. Of these forty compounds we identified nine potential hits to have an effect on preferential activation of the HDR pathway over NHEJ. Alisertib, rucaparib and belinostat revealed a significant and major effect on gene editing pathway selection in further validation. Alisertib, an Aurora kinase A inhibitor, showed a particularly strong effect towards improving HDR over NHEJ. We subsequently investigated this effect at the genetic level and in a murine hepatoma cell line, which corroborated the initial findings. Alisertib led to an over 4-fold increase in preferential gene correction over gene knock-out, at a dose of 0.3 micromolar. However, the observations that Aurora kinase A inhibitors show considerable cytotoxicity (\u003c50% cell viability) and can induce morphological changes at this concentration pose a limitation for the direct use of these inhibitors as HDR enhancers. However these findings do implicate that the pathways mediated by Aurora kinase A strongly influence HDR outcomes, which warrants further investigation into the downstream pathways driving this effect.\nDextrin conjugation to colistin inhibits its toxicity, cellular uptake and acute kidney injury in vivo.\nAuthors: Varache, M.; Rizzo, S.; Sayers, E. J.; Newbury, L.; Mason, A.; Liao, C.-T.; Chiron, E.; Bourdiec, N.; Jones, A.; Fraser, D. J.; Taylor, P. R.; Jones, A. T.; Thomas, D. W.; Ferguson, E. L.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565265\nThe acute kidney injury (AKI) and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, which occurs in 20-60% of patients following systemic administration of colistin, represents a challenge in the effective treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. To reduce clinical toxicity of colistin and improve targeting to infected /inflamed tissues, we previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates, whereby colistin is designed to be released by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin in infected and inflamed tissues, after passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Whilst it was evident in vitro that polymer conjugation can reduce toxicity and prolong plasma half-life, without significant reduction in antimicrobial activity of colistin, it was unclear how dextrin conjugation would alter cellular uptake and localisation of colistin in renal tubular cells in vivo. We discovered that dextrin conjugation effectively reduced colistins toxicity towards human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) in vitro, which was mirrored by significantly less cellular uptake of Oregon Green (OG)-labelled dextrin-colistin conjugate, when compared to colistin. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we revealed localisation of both, free and dextrin-bound colistin in endolysosome compartments of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Using a murine AKI model, we demonstrated dextrin-colistin conjugation dramatically diminishes both proximal tubular injury and renal accumulation of colistin. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which dextrin conjugation can overcome colistins renal toxicity and show the potential of polymer conjugation to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs.

This disorder has the cardinal symptoms including impaired social behavior involving the amygdala. Antidepressants such as paroxetine in early pregnancy increase the risk of ASD in offspring. However, a comprehensive picture of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to paroxetine suppresses neurogenesis in the optic tectum and the dorsal telencephalon which corresponds to the human amygdala. Paroxetine-treated embryos exhibit impaired growth, with small heads and short body lengths resulting from transient apoptosis. This is reminiscent of the early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with ASD. Interestingly, the suppressed neurogenesis in the small heads was found to be restored after the cessation of paroxetine. This was accompanied by extended retinotectal projections, suggesting brain-preferential remodeling. Finally, the paroxetine-treated fish exhibited impaired social behavior, further supporting the correspondence with ASD. Our findings offer new insights into the early neurodevelopmental etiology of ASD.\nOral delivery of the amylin receptor agonist pramlintide\nAuthors: Sinezia, C.; Sisnande, T.; Icart, L. P.; Lima, L. M. T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566408\nAim: The aims of this study were to design and characterize polymeric microparticles for oral delivery of pramlintide, a triple proline human amylin analogue clinically proved efficient in diabetes therapy. Methods: The microparticles were prepared with gastric-resistant polymer Eudragit S100 by double-emulsion and solvent evaporation technique. The study responses were repeatability, encapsulation efficiency, yield, morphology, particle size, response to acidic and alkaline milieu and pharmacokinetics. Results: We obtained spherical microcapsules, with particle size of 66 micrometer + 11, with 83.2 % + 2.7 efficiency for pramlintide entrapment and 67.6 % + 2.1 yield. Intra-venous pramlintide free in solution showed a plasmatic half-life of 6.8 min in mice. In contrast, oral delivery of acid-resistant pramlintide-loaded microparticles in mice showed a protracted release for 120 min compared to 30 min obtained for pramlintide in solution. Conclusions: Oral route is an alternative for therapeutic development of pramlintide formulations.\nIn vivo screening for toxicity-modulating drug interactions identifies antagonism that protects against ototoxicity in zebrafish\nAuthors: Bustad, E.; Mudrock, E.; Nilles, E. M.; McQuate, A.; Bergado, M.; Gu, A.; Galitan, L.; Gleason, N.; Ou, H. C.; Raible, D. W.; Hernandez, R. E.; Ma, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566159\nOtotoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications with diverse mechanisms of action, many of which could be taken concurrently to treat multiple conditions. Approaches for preclinical evaluation of drug interactions that might impact ototoxicity would facilitate design of safer multi-drug regimens and mitigate unsafe polypharmacy by flagging combinations that potentially cause adverse interactions for monitoring. They may also identify protective agents that antagonize ototoxic injury. To address this need, we have developed a novel workflow that we call Parallelized Evaluation of Protection and Injury for Toxicity Assessment (PEPITA), which empowers high-throughput, semi-automated quantification of ototoxicity and otoprotection in zebrafish larvae. By applying PEPITA to characterize ototoxic drug interaction outcomes, we have discovered antagonistic interactions between macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics that confer protection against aminoglycoside-induced damage to lateral line hair cells in zebrafish larvae. Co-administration of either azithromycin or erythromycin in zebrafish protected against damage from a broad panel of aminoglycosides, at least in part via inhibiting drug uptake into hair cells via a mechanism independent from hair cell mechanotransduction. Conversely, combining macrolides with aminoglycosides in bacterial inhibition assays does not show antagonism of antimicrobial efficacy. The proof-of-concept otoprotective antagonism suggests that combinatorial interventions can potentially be developed to protect against other forms of toxicity without hindering on-target drug efficacy.\nInsights into the early-life chemical exposome of Nigerian infants and potential correlations with the developing gut microbiome\nAuthors: Oesterle, I.; Ayeni, K. I.; Ezekiel, C. N.; Berry, D.; Rompel, A.; Warth, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566030\nEarly-life exposure to natural and/or synthetic chemicals can impact acute and chronic health conditions. Here, a suspect screening workflow anchored on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to elucidate xenobiotics in breast milk and matching stool samples collected from Nigerian mother-infant pairs (n = 11) at three-time points. Potential correlations between xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, were subsequently explored. Overall, 12,192 and 16,461 features were acquired in the breast milk and stool samples, respectively. Following quality control and suspect screening, 562 and 864 features remained, respectively, with 149 of these features present in both matrices. Taking advantage of 242 authentic reference standards measured for confirmatory purposes of both, potentially beneficial and adverse xenobiotics, 34 features in breast milk and 68 features in stool were unambiguously identified and subsequently semi-quantified. Moreover, 51 and 78 features were annotated with spectral library matching, as well as 416 and 652 with in silico fragmentation in breast milk and stool, respectively. Despite that the workflow was originally optimized for polyphenols, a diverse range of other chemical classes were simultaneously identified including mycotoxins, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), antibiotics, plasticizers, perfluorinated alkylated substances, and pesticides. Spearman rank correlation of the identified features revealed significant correlations between chemicals of the same classification such as polyphenols. One-way ANOVA and differential abundance analysis of the data obtained from stool samples revealed that features of plant-based origin were elevated when complementary foods were introduced to the infants diets. Features in the stool deemed significant by ANOVA, such as tricetin, positively correlated with the genus Blautia. Moreover, vulgaxanthin negatively correlated with Escherichia-Shigella. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study provides high-quality exposure data of matched biospecimens obtained from mother-infant pairs in sub-Saharan Africa, and showed potential correlations between the chemical exposome and the gut microbiome.

A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564282\nEpidemiological evidence suggests that the legalization of cannabis may reduce opioid-related harms. Preclinical evidence of neuropharmacological interactions of endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems prompts further investigation of cannabinoids as potential therapeutics for the non-medical use of opioids. In these studies female rats, previously trained to self-administer oxycodone (0.15 mg/kg/infusion) intravenously in 6 h sessions, were allowed to self-administer oxycodone after exposure to cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by vapor inhalation and THC by injection (5.0-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Self-administration was characterized under Progressive Ratio (PR) and Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedules of reinforcement in 3 h sessions. THC decreased IVSA of oxycodone in a FR procedure but increased reward seeking in a PR procedure. CBD decreased the IVSA of oxycodone in the FR but not the PR procedure. The results are consistent with an anti-reward effect of CBD but suggest THC acts to increase the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in this procedure.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) administered intranasally as dry powders can be potentially applied for the treatment or pre-exposure prevention of viral infections in the upper respiratory tract. However, a method to transform the mAbs from liquid to dry powders suitable for intranasal administration and a device that can spray the dry powders to the desired region of the nasal cavity are needed to fully realize the potentials of the mAbs. Herein, we report that thin-film freeze-drying can be applied to prepare aerosolizable mAb dry powders and that the dry powders can be sprayed into the posterior nasal cavity using Aptar Pharmas Unidose (UDS) Powder Nasal Spray System. AUG-3387, a human-derived mAb that neutralizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was used in the present study. First, we prepared AUG-3387 thin-film freeze-dried powders (i.e., TFF AUG-3387 powders) from liquid formulations containing different levels of mAbs. The TFF AUG-3387 powder with the highest solid content (i.e., TFF AUG-3387C powder) was then chosen for further characterization, including the evaluation of the plume geometry, spray pattern, and particle size distribution after the powder was sprayed using the UDS Powder device. Finally, the deposition patterns of the TFF AUG-3387C powder sprayed using the UDS Powder device were studied using 3D-printed nasal replica casts based on an adult model and a child model. It is concluded that it is feasible to intranasally deliver mAbs as dry powders by transforming the mAbs into dry powders using thin-film freeze-drying and then spray the powder using the UDS Powder device.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains difficult to treat due to its heterogeneity in molecular landscape, epigenetics and cell signaling alterations. Precision medicine is a major goal in AML therapy towards developing agents that can be used to treat patients with different &#39;subtypes&#39; in combination with current chemotherapies. We have previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates to combat the rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections and overcome dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Recent evidence of colistin&#39;s anticancer activity, mediated through inhibition of intracellular lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A), suggests that dextrin-colistin conjugates could be used to treat cancer cells, including AML. This study aimed to evaluate whether dextrin conjugation (which reduces in vivo toxicity and prolongs plasma half-life) could enhance colistin&#39;s cytotoxic effects in myeloid leukemia cell lines and compare the intracellular uptake and localization of the free and conjugated antibiotic. Our results identified a conjugate (containing 8,000 g/mol dextrin with 1 mol% succinoylation) that caused significantly increased toxicity in myeloid leukemia cells, compared to free colistin. Dextrin conjugation altered the mechanism of cell death by colistin, from necrosis to caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, conjugation via a reversible ester linker, instead of an amide, had no effect on the mechanism of the colistin-induced cell death. Live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently-labelled compounds showed both free and dextrin-conjugated colistin were endocytosed and co-localized in lysosomes and increasing the degree of modification by succinoylation of dextrin significantly reduced colistin internalization. Whilst clinical translation of dextrin-colistin conjugates for the treatment of AML is unlikely due to the potential to promote AMR and the relatively high colistin concentrations required for anticancer activity, the ability to potentiate the effectiveness of an anticancer drug by polymer conjugation, while reducing side effects and improving biodistribution of the drug, is very attractive, and this approach warrants further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR gene therapy holds the potential to cure a variety of genetic diseases by targeting causative mutations and introducing double stranded DNA breaks, subsequently allowing the host DNA repair mechanisms to introduce mutations. One option to introduce precise gene corrections is via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. HDR can introduce a range of desired mutations dictated by a DNA template which holds a corrected DNA sequence which is written into the targeted gene. The problem in utilizing this pathway is that CRISPR-induced double stranded DNA breaks are repaired more often through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which does not use a designed template and introduces random DNA damage in the form of insertions and deletions at the cut site. Since HDR activation depends on many interconnected processes in the cell, we aimed to screen a small library of drug compounds in clinical use or clinical development for cancer, to steer the DNA repair process towards preferential HDR activation.

We included compounds in our screen based on three relevant mechanisms in CRISPR gene editing: the cell cycle, DNA repair processing and chromosomal packing. We included forty compounds, based on these criteria, screened their toxicity and dosed them in sub-toxic concentrations in cells during genome editing. Of these forty compounds we identified nine potential hits to have an effect on preferential activation of the HDR pathway over NHEJ. Alisertib, rucaparib and belinostat revealed a significant and major effect on gene editing pathway selection in further validation.

Alisertib, an Aurora kinase A inhibitor, showed a particularly strong effect towards improving HDR over NHEJ. We subsequently investigated this effect at the genetic level and in a murine hepatoma cell line, which corroborated the initial findings. Alisertib led to an over 4-fold increase in preferential gene correction over gene knock-out, at a dose of 0.3 micromolar. However, the observations that Aurora kinase A inhibitors show considerable cytotoxicity (&lt;50% cell viability) and can induce morphological changes at this concentration pose a limitation for the direct use of these inhibitors as HDR enhancers. However these findings do implicate that the pathways mediated by Aurora kinase A strongly influence HDR outcomes, which warrants further investigation into the downstream pathways driving this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The acute kidney injury (AKI) and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, which occurs in 20-60% of patients following systemic administration of colistin, represents a challenge in the effective treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. To reduce clinical toxicity of colistin and improve targeting to infected /inflamed tissues, we previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates, whereby colistin is designed to be released by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin in infected and inflamed tissues, after passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Whilst it was evident in vitro that polymer conjugation can reduce toxicity and prolong plasma half-life, without significant reduction in antimicrobial activity of colistin, it was unclear how dextrin conjugation would alter cellular uptake and localisation of colistin in renal tubular cells in vivo. We discovered that dextrin conjugation effectively reduced colistins toxicity towards human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) in vitro, which was mirrored by significantly less cellular uptake of Oregon Green (OG)-labelled dextrin-colistin conjugate, when compared to colistin. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we revealed localisation of both, free and dextrin-bound colistin in endolysosome compartments of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Using a murine AKI model, we demonstrated dextrin-colistin conjugation dramatically diminishes both proximal tubular injury and renal accumulation of colistin. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which dextrin conjugation can overcome colistins renal toxicity and show the potential of polymer conjugation to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs.

        <p class="abstract">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition caused by various genetic and environmental factors. This disorder has the cardinal symptoms including impaired social behavior involving the amygdala. Antidepressants such as paroxetine in early pregnancy increase the risk of ASD in offspring. However, a comprehensive picture of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that early exposure of zebrafish embryos to paroxetine suppresses neurogenesis in the optic tectum and the dorsal telencephalon which corresponds to the human amygdala. Paroxetine-treated embryos exhibit impaired growth, with small heads and short body lengths resulting from transient apoptosis. This is reminiscent of the early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) associated with ASD. Interestingly, the suppressed neurogenesis in the small heads was found to be restored after the cessation of paroxetine. This was accompanied by extended retinotectal projections, suggesting brain-preferential remodeling. Finally, the paroxetine-treated fish exhibited impaired social behavior, further supporting the correspondence with ASD. Our findings offer new insights into the early neurodevelopmental etiology of ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aim: The aims of this study were to design and characterize polymeric microparticles for oral delivery of pramlintide, a triple proline human amylin analogue clinically proved efficient in diabetes therapy. Methods: The microparticles were prepared with gastric-resistant polymer Eudragit S100 by double-emulsion and solvent evaporation technique. The study responses were repeatability, encapsulation efficiency, yield, morphology, particle size, response to acidic and alkaline milieu and pharmacokinetics. Results: We obtained spherical microcapsules, with particle size of 66 micrometer &#43; 11, with 83.2 % &#43; 2.7 efficiency for pramlintide entrapment and 67.6 % &#43; 2.1 yield. Intra-venous pramlintide free in solution showed a plasmatic half-life of 6.8 min in mice. In contrast, oral delivery of acid-resistant pramlintide-loaded microparticles in mice showed a protracted release for 120 min compared to 30 min obtained for pramlintide in solution. Conclusions: Oral route is an alternative for therapeutic development of pramlintide formulations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications with diverse mechanisms of action, many of which could be taken concurrently to treat multiple conditions. Approaches for preclinical evaluation of drug interactions that might impact ototoxicity would facilitate design of safer multi-drug regimens and mitigate unsafe polypharmacy by flagging combinations that potentially cause adverse interactions for monitoring. They may also identify protective agents that antagonize ototoxic injury. To address this need, we have developed a novel workflow that we call Parallelized Evaluation of Protection and Injury for Toxicity Assessment (PEPITA), which empowers high-throughput, semi-automated quantification of ototoxicity and otoprotection in zebrafish larvae. By applying PEPITA to characterize ototoxic drug interaction outcomes, we have discovered antagonistic interactions between macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics that confer protection against aminoglycoside-induced damage to lateral line hair cells in zebrafish larvae. Co-administration of either azithromycin or erythromycin in zebrafish protected against damage from a broad panel of aminoglycosides, at least in part via inhibiting drug uptake into hair cells via a mechanism independent from hair cell mechanotransduction. Conversely, combining macrolides with aminoglycosides in bacterial inhibition assays does not show antagonism of antimicrobial efficacy. The proof-of-concept otoprotective antagonism suggests that combinatorial interventions can potentially be developed to protect against other forms of toxicity without hindering on-target drug efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life exposure to natural and/or synthetic chemicals can impact acute and chronic health conditions. Here, a suspect screening workflow anchored on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to elucidate xenobiotics in breast milk and matching stool samples collected from Nigerian mother-infant pairs (n = 11) at three-time points. Potential correlations between xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, were subsequently explored. Overall, 12,192 and 16,461 features were acquired in the breast milk and stool samples, respectively. Following quality control and suspect screening, 562 and 864 features remained, respectively, with 149 of these features present in both matrices. Taking advantage of 242 authentic reference standards measured for confirmatory purposes of both, potentially beneficial and adverse xenobiotics, 34 features in breast milk and 68 features in stool were unambiguously identified and subsequently semi-quantified. Moreover, 51 and 78 features were annotated with spectral library matching, as well as 416 and 652 with in silico fragmentation in breast milk and stool, respectively. Despite that the workflow was originally optimized for polyphenols, a diverse range of other chemical classes were simultaneously identified including mycotoxins, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), antibiotics, plasticizers, perfluorinated alkylated substances, and pesticides. Spearman rank correlation of the identified features revealed significant correlations between chemicals of the same classification such as polyphenols. One-way ANOVA and differential abundance analysis of the data obtained from stool samples revealed that features of plant-based origin were elevated when complementary foods were introduced to the infants diets. Features in the stool deemed significant by ANOVA, such as tricetin, positively correlated with the genus Blautia. Moreover, vulgaxanthin negatively correlated with Escherichia-Shigella. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study provides high-quality exposure data of matched biospecimens obtained from mother-infant pairs in sub-Saharan Africa, and showed potential correlations between the chemical exposome and the gut microbiome.

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological evidence suggests that the legalization of cannabis may reduce opioid-related harms. Preclinical evidence of neuropharmacological interactions of endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems prompts further investigation of cannabinoids as potential therapeutics for the non-medical use of opioids. In these studies female rats, previously trained to self-administer oxycodone (0.15 mg/kg/infusion) intravenously in 6 h sessions, were allowed to self-administer oxycodone after exposure to cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by vapor inhalation and THC by injection (5.0-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Self-administration was characterized under Progressive Ratio (PR) and Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedules of reinforcement in 3 h sessions. THC decreased IVSA of oxycodone in a FR procedure but increased reward seeking in a PR procedure. CBD decreased the IVSA of oxycodone in the FR but not the PR procedure. The results are consistent with an anti-reward effect of CBD but suggest THC acts to increase the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in this procedure.</p>
