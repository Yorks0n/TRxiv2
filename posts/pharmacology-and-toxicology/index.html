The reasons for these marked differences in sensitivity are presently unknown. The objective of this research was to explore potential toxicokinetic drivers of species sensitivity by characterizing biliary metabolites of 6PPD-Q in sensitive and tolerant fishes. For the first time, we identified an O-glucuronide metabolite of 6PPD-Q using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The semi-quantified levels of this metabolite in tolerant species or life stages, including white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkia lewisi) and non-fry life stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), were greater than those in sensitive species, including coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), suggesting that tolerant species might more effectively detoxify 6PPD-Q. Thus, we hypothesize that differences in species sensitivity are a result of differences in basal expression of biotransformation enzyme across various fish species. Moreover, the semi-quantification of 6PPD-Q metabolites in bile extracted from wild-caught fish might be a useful biomarker of exposure to 6PPD-Q, thereby being invaluable to environmental monitoring and risk assessment.\nIlluminating the Function of the Orphan Transporter, SLC22A10 in Humans and Other Primates\nAuthors: Yee, S. W.; Ferrandez-Peral, L.; Alentorn, P.; Fontsere, C.; Ceylan, M.; Koleske, M. L.; Handin, N.; Artegoitia, V. M.; Lara, G.; Chien, H.-C.; Zhou, X.; Dainat, J.; Zalevsky, A.; Sali, A.; Brand, C. M.; Capra, J. A.; Artursson, P.; Newman, J. W.; Marques-Bonet, T.; Giacomini, K. M.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552553\nSLC22A10 is classified as an orphan transporter with unknown substrates and function. Here we describe the discovery of the substrate specificity and functional characteristics of SLC22A10. The human SLC22A10 tagged with green fluorescent protein was found to be absent from the plasma membrane, in contrast to the SLC22A10 orthologs found in great apes. Estradiol-17{beta}-glucuronide accumulated in cells expressing great ape SLC22A10 orthologs (over 4-fold, p\u003c0.001). In contrast, human SLC22A10 displayed no uptake function. Sequence alignments revealed two amino acid differences including a proline at position 220 of the human SLC22A10 and a leucine at the same position of great ape orthologs. Site-directed mutagenesis yielding the human SLC22A10-P220L produced a protein with excellent plasma membrane localization and associated uptake function. Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes show human-like sequences at proline 220 position, corroborating that SLC22A10 were rendered nonfunctional during hominin evolution after the divergence from the pan lineage (chimpanzees and bonobos). These findings demonstrate that human SLC22A10 is a unitary pseudogene and was inactivated by a missense mutation that is fixed in humans, whereas orthologs in great apes transport sex steroid conjugates.\nDuhuo Jisheng Decoction Regulates Intracellular Zinc Homeostasis by Enhancing Autophagy via PTEN/Akt/mTOR to Improve Knee Cartilage Degeneration\nAuthors: Wang, Y.-H.; Zhou, Y.; Gao, X.; Sun, S.; Xie, Y.-Z.; Hu, Y.-P.; Fu, Y.; Fan, X.; Xie, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553976\nBackground: Articular cartilage degeneration as well as cartilage matrix degradation is one of the key pathological changes in the early stage of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). However, currently, there are limited early prevention and treatment options available. Duhuo Jisheng Decoction (DHJSD) is a formula from Bei Ji Qian jin Yao Fang compiled by Sun Simiao in the Tang Dynasty of China. As a complementary therapy, it is widely used to treat early-stage KOA in China, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Objective: This study is aiming at investigating the potential role and mechanism of DHJSD in protecting cartilage from degradation. Methods: The mechanism of DHJSD in alleviating OA was explored by gene silencing technology combined with a series of functional experiments in primary rat chondrocytes. Next, 25 wistar rats were used to validate the results obtained in vitro. The PTEN, Akt, mTOR, MMP13, Zn, collagen II, autophagy and apoptosis were determined. Results: DHJSD reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and the expression of zinc, MMP13, Bax and Bcl2. DHJSD increased the level of autophagy and the expression of autophagy proteins LC3 and Beclin1. After silencing PTEN gene, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR and the effects of Bax, Bcl2, LC3 and Beclin1 were weakened by DHJSD. DHJSD increased the formation of autophagosomes in chondrocytes. Histopathological staining revealed that DHJSD had a protective effect on cartilage. Conclusion: DHJSD inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by targeting PTEN to promote autophagy in chondrocytes, which may be closely to repress the formation of MMP-13 by regulating the level of zinc in chondrocytes.\nIn vitro toxicity of LiTFSI on Human Renal and Hepatoma Cells\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Sands, M.; Lin, M.; Guelfo, J.; Irudayaraj, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553404\nWe evaluate the cytotoxicity, intracellular redox conditions, apoptosis, and methylation of DNMTs/TETs upon exposure to LiTFSI, a novel PFAS compound commonly found in lithium-ion batteries, on human renal carcinoma cells (A498) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). The MTT assay showed both PFOS and LiTFSI had a dose-dependent effect on A498 and HepG2, with LiTFSI being less toxic. Intracellular redox conditions were assessed with a microplate reader and confocal, which showed a significant decrease in ROS levels and an increase in SOD content in both cells. Exposure to LiTFSI enhanced cell apoptosis, with HepG2 being more susceptible than A498. Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of 19 genes associated with kidney injury, methylation, lipid metabolism and transportation was performed. LiTFSI exposure impacted kidney function by downregulating Acta2 and upregulating Tgfb1, Bcl2l1, Harvcr1, Nfe2l2, and Hes1 expression. LiTFSI exposure also affected the abundance of transcripts associated with DNA methylation by the expression of TET and DNMT genes. Furthermore, LiTFSI exposure induced an increase in lipid anabolism and alterations in lipid catabolism in HepG2. Our results provide new insight on the potential role of a new contaminant, LiTFSI in the regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and methylation in human renal carcinoma and hepatoma cells.\nScreening for novel RyR2 inhibitors by ER Ca2+ monitoring\nAuthors: Takenaka, M.; Kodama, M.; Murayama, T.; Ishigami-Yuasa, M.; Mori, S.; Ishida, R.; Suzuki, J.; Kanemaru, K.; Sugihara, M.; Iino, M.; Miura, A.; Nishio, H.; Morimoto, S.; Kagechika, H.; Sakurai, T.; Kurebayashi, N.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553510\nType 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca2+ release channel on the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) that plays a central role in the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Hyperactivity of RyR2 has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and heart failure, where spontaneous Ca2+ release via hyperactivated RyR2 depolarizes diastolic membrane potential to induce triggered activity. In such cases, drugs that suppress RyR2 activity are expected to prevent the arrhythmias, but there is no clinically available RyR2 inhibitors at present. In this study, we searched for RyR2 inhibitors from a well-characterized compound library using a recently developed ER Ca2+-based assay, where the inhibition of RyR2 activity was detected by the increase in ER Ca2+ signals from R-CEPIA1er, a genetically encoded ER Ca2+ indicator, in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. By screening 1535 compounds in the library, we identified three compounds (chloroxylenol, methyl orsellinate and riluzole) that greatly increased the ER Ca2+ signal. All of the three compounds suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells and correspondingly reduced the Ca2+-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding activity. In cardiomyocytes from RyR2-mutant mice, the three compounds effectively suppressed abnormal Ca2+ waves without substantial effects on the action-potential-induced Ca2+ transients. These results confirm that ER Ca2+-based screening is useful for identifying modulators of ER Ca2+ release channels and suggest that RyR2 inhibitors have potential to be developed as a new category of antiarrhythmic drugs.\nAn in-silico approach to identify bioactive phytochemicals from Houttuynia cordata Thunb. As potential inhibitors of Human Glutathione Reductase\nAuthors: Sangeet, S.; Khan, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553374\nCellular infections underpin the pathogenesis of cancer and malaria. Mitigating cellular oxidative stress via glutathione reductase (GR) inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue. Exploiting the antioxidant-rich Houttuynia cordata Thunb., we investigated natural GR inhibitors. Among 13 docked phytochemicals, Quercetin, Quercitrin, and Sesamin exhibited exceptional GR binding affinities. Molecular Docking analysis highlighted their propensity to precisely target the GR active site. Subsequent 150 ns molecular dynamics simulations corroborated their robust interactions, unveiling dynamic stabilizing effects on the protein structure and bolstering their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, ADME-Tox profiling affirmed their favourable drug-like attributes. These findings underscore H. cordatas reservoir of potent antioxidants, poised to combat various maladies, including malaria and cancer. This study distinctly accentuates the distinctive outcomes and paramount significance of harnessing H. cordata phytochemicals as efficacious antioxidants, unravelling novel therapeutic avenues.\nRats Chasing the Dragon: A new heroin inhalation method\nAuthors: Gutierrez, A.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552712\nRationaleDespite extensive human use of the inhalation route for ingesting opioids, models in rodents have mostly been limited to parenteral injection and oral dosing. Methods using electronic drug delivery systems (EDDS; \"e-cigarettes\") have shown efficacy in rodent models but these do not faithfully mimic the most popular human inhalation method of heating heroin to the point of vaporization. ObjectiveThis study was designed to determine if direct volatilization of heroin hydrochloride delivers effective heroin doses to rodents. MethodsMiddle aged rats were exposed to vapor created by direct heating of heroin HCl powder in a ceramic e-cigarette type atomizer. Efficacy was determined with a warm water tail withdrawal nociception assay, rectal temperature and self-administration. ResultsTen minutes of inhalation of vaporized heroin slowed response latency in a warm water tail withdrawal assay and increased rectal temperature in male rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Similar antinociceptive effects in female rats were attenuated by the opioid antagonist naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). Female rats made operant responses for heroin vapor in 15-minute sessions, increased their response rate when the reinforcement ratio increased from FR1 to FR5, and further increased their responding when vapor delivery was omitted. Anti-nociceptive effects of self-administered volatilized heroin were of a similar magnitude as those produced by the 10-minute non-contingent exposure. ConclusionsThis study shows that \"chasing the dragon\" methods of inhalation of heroin can be modeled successfully in the rat. Inhalation techniques may be particularly useful for longer term studies deep into middle age of rat species.\n",

        <p class="abstract">N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N-Phenyl-P-Phenylenediamine-Quinone (6PPD-Q) is a recently identified contaminant that originates from the oxidation of the tire anti-degradant 6PPD. 6PPD-Q is acutely toxic to select salmonids at environmentally relevant concentrations, while other fish species display tolerance to concentrations surpassing those measured in the environment. The reasons for these marked differences in sensitivity are presently unknown. The objective of this research was to explore potential toxicokinetic drivers of species sensitivity by characterizing biliary metabolites of 6PPD-Q in sensitive and tolerant fishes. For the first time, we identified an O-glucuronide metabolite of 6PPD-Q using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The semi-quantified levels of this metabolite in tolerant species or life stages, including white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkia lewisi) and non-fry life stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), were greater than those in sensitive species, including coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), suggesting that tolerant species might more effectively detoxify 6PPD-Q. Thus, we hypothesize that differences in species sensitivity are a result of differences in basal expression of biotransformation enzyme across various fish species. Moreover, the semi-quantification of 6PPD-Q metabolites in bile extracted from wild-caught fish might be a useful biomarker of exposure to 6PPD-Q, thereby being invaluable to environmental monitoring and risk assessment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SLC22A10 is classified as an orphan transporter with unknown substrates and function. Here we describe the discovery of the substrate specificity and functional characteristics of SLC22A10. The human SLC22A10 tagged with green fluorescent protein was found to be absent from the plasma membrane, in contrast to the SLC22A10 orthologs found in great apes. Estradiol-17{beta}-glucuronide accumulated in cells expressing great ape SLC22A10 orthologs (over 4-fold, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, human SLC22A10 displayed no uptake function. Sequence alignments revealed two amino acid differences including a proline at position 220 of the human SLC22A10 and a leucine at the same position of great ape orthologs. Site-directed mutagenesis yielding the human SLC22A10-P220L produced a protein with excellent plasma membrane localization and associated uptake function. Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes show human-like sequences at proline 220 position, corroborating that SLC22A10 were rendered nonfunctional during hominin evolution after the divergence from the pan lineage (chimpanzees and bonobos). These findings demonstrate that human SLC22A10 is a unitary pseudogene and was inactivated by a missense mutation that is fixed in humans, whereas orthologs in great apes transport sex steroid conjugates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Articular cartilage degeneration as well as cartilage matrix degradation is one of the key pathological changes in the early stage of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). However, currently, there are limited early prevention and treatment options available. Duhuo Jisheng Decoction (DHJSD) is a formula from Bei Ji Qian jin Yao Fang compiled by Sun Simiao in the Tang Dynasty of China. As a complementary therapy, it is widely used to treat early-stage KOA in China, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Objective: This study is aiming at investigating the potential role and mechanism of DHJSD in protecting cartilage from degradation. Methods: The mechanism of DHJSD in alleviating OA was explored by gene silencing technology combined with a series of functional experiments in primary rat chondrocytes. Next, 25 wistar rats were used to validate the results obtained in vitro. The PTEN, Akt, mTOR, MMP13, Zn, collagen II, autophagy and apoptosis were determined. Results: DHJSD reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR and the expression of zinc, MMP13, Bax and Bcl2. DHJSD increased the level of autophagy and the expression of autophagy proteins LC3 and Beclin1. After silencing PTEN gene, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR and the effects of Bax, Bcl2, LC3 and Beclin1 were weakened by DHJSD. DHJSD increased the formation of autophagosomes in chondrocytes. Histopathological staining revealed that DHJSD had a protective effect on cartilage. Conclusion: DHJSD inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by targeting PTEN to promote autophagy in chondrocytes, which may be closely to repress the formation of MMP-13 by regulating the level of zinc in chondrocytes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We evaluate the cytotoxicity, intracellular redox conditions, apoptosis, and methylation of DNMTs/TETs upon exposure to LiTFSI, a novel PFAS compound commonly found in lithium-ion batteries, on human renal carcinoma cells (A498) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). The MTT assay showed both PFOS and LiTFSI had a dose-dependent effect on A498 and HepG2, with LiTFSI being less toxic. Intracellular redox conditions were assessed with a microplate reader and confocal, which showed a significant decrease in ROS levels and an increase in SOD content in both cells. Exposure to LiTFSI enhanced cell apoptosis, with HepG2 being more susceptible than A498. Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of 19 genes associated with kidney injury, methylation, lipid metabolism and transportation was performed. LiTFSI exposure impacted kidney function by downregulating Acta2 and upregulating Tgfb1, Bcl2l1, Harvcr1, Nfe2l2, and Hes1 expression. LiTFSI exposure also affected the abundance of transcripts associated with DNA methylation by the expression of TET and DNMT genes. Furthermore, LiTFSI exposure induced an increase in lipid anabolism and alterations in lipid catabolism in HepG2. Our results provide new insight on the potential role of a new contaminant, LiTFSI in the regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and methylation in human renal carcinoma and hepatoma cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is a Ca2&#43; release channel on the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) that plays a central role in the excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Hyperactivity of RyR2 has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and heart failure, where spontaneous Ca2&#43; release via hyperactivated RyR2 depolarizes diastolic membrane potential to induce triggered activity. In such cases, drugs that suppress RyR2 activity are expected to prevent the arrhythmias, but there is no clinically available RyR2 inhibitors at present. In this study, we searched for RyR2 inhibitors from a well-characterized compound library using a recently developed ER Ca2&#43;-based assay, where the inhibition of RyR2 activity was detected by the increase in ER Ca2&#43; signals from R-CEPIA1er, a genetically encoded ER Ca2&#43; indicator, in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells. By screening 1535 compounds in the library, we identified three compounds (chloroxylenol, methyl orsellinate and riluzole) that greatly increased the ER Ca2&#43; signal. All of the three compounds suppressed spontaneous Ca2&#43; oscillations in RyR2-expressing HEK293 cells and correspondingly reduced the Ca2&#43;-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding activity. In cardiomyocytes from RyR2-mutant mice, the three compounds effectively suppressed abnormal Ca2&#43; waves without substantial effects on the action-potential-induced Ca2&#43; transients. These results confirm that ER Ca2&#43;-based screening is useful for identifying modulators of ER Ca2&#43; release channels and suggest that RyR2 inhibitors have potential to be developed as a new category of antiarrhythmic drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular infections underpin the pathogenesis of cancer and malaria. Mitigating cellular oxidative stress via glutathione reductase (GR) inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue. Exploiting the antioxidant-rich Houttuynia cordata Thunb., we investigated natural GR inhibitors. Among 13 docked phytochemicals, Quercetin, Quercitrin, and Sesamin exhibited exceptional GR binding affinities. Molecular Docking analysis highlighted their propensity to precisely target the GR active site. Subsequent 150 ns molecular dynamics simulations corroborated their robust interactions, unveiling dynamic stabilizing effects on the protein structure and bolstering their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, ADME-Tox profiling affirmed their favourable drug-like attributes. These findings underscore H. cordatas reservoir of potent antioxidants, poised to combat various maladies, including malaria and cancer. This study distinctly accentuates the distinctive outcomes and paramount significance of harnessing H. cordata phytochemicals as efficacious antioxidants, unravelling novel therapeutic avenues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleDespite extensive human use of the inhalation route for ingesting opioids, models in rodents have mostly been limited to parenteral injection and oral dosing. Methods using electronic drug delivery systems (EDDS; &#34;e-cigarettes&#34;) have shown efficacy in rodent models but these do not faithfully mimic the most popular human inhalation method of heating heroin to the point of vaporization.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to determine if direct volatilization of heroin hydrochloride delivers effective heroin doses to rodents.

MethodsMiddle aged rats were exposed to vapor created by direct heating of heroin HCl powder in a ceramic e-cigarette type atomizer. Efficacy was determined with a warm water tail withdrawal nociception assay, rectal temperature and self-administration.

ResultsTen minutes of inhalation of vaporized heroin slowed response latency in a warm water tail withdrawal assay and increased rectal temperature in male rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Similar antinociceptive effects in female rats were attenuated by the opioid antagonist naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). Female rats made operant responses for heroin vapor in 15-minute sessions, increased their response rate when the reinforcement ratio increased from FR1 to FR5, and further increased their responding when vapor delivery was omitted. Anti-nociceptive effects of self-administered volatilized heroin were of a similar magnitude as those produced by the 10-minute non-contingent exposure.

ConclusionsThis study shows that &#34;chasing the dragon&#34; methods of inhalation of heroin can be modeled successfully in the rat. Inhalation techniques may be particularly useful for longer term studies deep into middle age of rat species.</p>
