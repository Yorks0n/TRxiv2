W.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550805\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), once thought to be active exclusively at the plasma 2 membrane, have been shown to signal from multiple intracellular membrane compartments, 3 including endosomes and the Golgi. However, the potential occurrence and functional 4 relevance of intracellular signaling for the emerging family of metabolite-sensing GPCRs is 5 largely unknown. Here, we used live-cell imaging, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 6 (BRET) measurements, and functional readouts to investigate signal compartmentalization of 7 the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR that is activated 8 by medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs). Unexpectedly, we show that FFA4 largely 9 resides on intracellular membranes that are intimately associated with lipid droplets in 10 adipocytes. Upon lipolysis induction, the released FFAs rapidly bind to and activate this 11 intracellular pool of FFA4, leading to local Gi/o coupling and inhibition of cAMP production in 12 the vicinity of lipid droplets. This provides a spatiotemporally confined negative feedback 13 mechanism allowing individual lipid droplets to rapidly adjust their lipolysis rate. Our results 14 reveal a novel \"intracrine\" signaling modality by a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR and 15 identify a new lipid-droplet-associated signaling hub implicated in the rapid regulation of lipid 16 metabolism, with important implications for adipocyte physiology and pharmacology.\nOptical Control of G-Actin with a Photoswitchable Latrunculin\nAuthors: Veprek, N. A.; Cooper, M. H.; Laprell, L.; Yang, E. J.-N.; Folkerts, S.; Bao, R.; Oertner, T. G.; Pon, L. A.; Zuchero, J. B.; Trauner, D. H.\nScore: 22.5, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549222\nActin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.\nTranscriptomic Effects of Low-Dose Inorganic Arsenic Exposure on Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages.\nAuthors: Illingworth, E. J.; Maertens, A.; Sille, F. C. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550543\nBoth tissue-resident macrophages and monocytes recruited from the bone marrow that transform into tissue-resident cells play critical roles in mediating homeostasis as well as in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the most common drinking water contaminant worldwide and represents a major public health concern. Several diseases that macrophages have implicated involvement in are caused by iAs exposure, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and increased risk of infectious disease. Therefore, understanding the effects of iAs exposure on macrophages can help us better grasp the full range of arsenic immunotoxicity and better design therapeutic targets for iAs-induced diseases particularly in exposed populations. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of low dose iAs-exposed male and female murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either M0, M1, or M2 stimulation. We identified differentially expressed genes by iAs in a sex- and stimulation-dependent manner and used bioinformatics tools to predict protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulatory networks, and associated biological processes. Overall, our data suggest that M1-stimulated, especially female-derived, BMDMs are most susceptible to iAs exposure. Most notably, we observed significant downregulation of major proinflammatory transcription factors, like IRF8, and its downstream targets, as well as genes encoding proteins involved in pattern recognition and antigen presentation, such as TLR7, TLR8, and H2-D1, potentially providing causal insight regarding arsenics role in perturbing immune responses to infectious diseases. We also observed significant downregulation of genes involved in processes crucial to coordinating a proinflammatory response including leukocyte migration, differentiation, and cytokine and chemokine production and response. Finally, we discovered that 24 X-linked genes were dysregulated in iAs-exposed female stimulation groups compared to only 3 across the iAs-exposed male stimulation groups. These findings elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the sex-differential iAs-associated immune-related disease risk.\nNepicastat, a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor decreases blood pressure and induces the infiltration of macrophages and B cells in the heart of spontaneous hypertensive rats\nAuthors: Chandan, S.; Kosher, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.549206\nNepicastat is a potent dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor that modulates the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the synthesis of norepinephrine. Nepicastat is a potential drug for the treatment of congestive heart failure. We sought to investigate the mechanistic role of Nepicastsat in the heart of Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats (SHR) rats. Here, we investigated if Nepicastat at both acute (7 days) and chronic administration (14 days) decrease blood pressure and echocardiography parameters in SHR rats. SHR 3-4 months male rats were administered either Nepicastsat (30mg/kg, orally), Enalapril (10 mg/kg, orally), or vehicle for 7 days or 14 days. Blood pressure and echocardiography parameters were recorded on day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 14 of drug administration. The animals were sacrificed, and tissues are collected for histology, qRTPCR, and flow cytometry analysis. At both acute and chronic administration, Nepicastat decreased systolic blood pressure and intraventricular septal thickness of SHR rats compared to vehicle groups. The decrease in blood pressure was comparable to Enalapril treated rats. Interestingly, Nepicastat also decreased the infiltrating macrophages and B cells in the hearts of SHR rats. In conclusion, Nepicastsat consistently decreased the systolic blood pressure but increased the macrophages and B cell infiltration in the heart of SHR rats.\nNeuropathic pain has sex-specific effects on oxycodone seeking and drug-seeking ensembles in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex\nAuthors: Sarka, B. C.; Liu, S.; Banerjee, A.; Stucky, C. L.; Liu, Q.-s.; Olsen, C. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.548045\nApproximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and opioids are commonly prescribed for such individuals. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drug-seeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury. HighlightsO_LIOxycodone seeking was higher in females following SNI that came after the 10-day SA timeline. C_LIO_LIAn increase in intrinsic excitability was detected among non-ensemble neurons from female mice that received SNI, and this correlated with an increase in seeking behavior. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Both tissue-resident macrophages and monocytes recruited from the bone marrow that transform into tissue-resident cells play critical roles in mediating homeostasis as well as in the pathology of inflammatory diseases. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the most common drinking water contaminant worldwide and represents a major public health concern. Several diseases that macrophages have implicated involvement in are caused by iAs exposure, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and increased risk of infectious disease. Therefore, understanding the effects of iAs exposure on macrophages can help us better grasp the full range of arsenic immunotoxicity and better design therapeutic targets for iAs-induced diseases particularly in exposed populations. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of low dose iAs-exposed male and female murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with either M0, M1, or M2 stimulation. We identified differentially expressed genes by iAs in a sex- and stimulation-dependent manner and used bioinformatics tools to predict protein-protein interactions, transcriptional regulatory networks, and associated biological processes. Overall, our data suggest that M1-stimulated, especially female-derived, BMDMs are most susceptible to iAs exposure. Most notably, we observed significant downregulation of major proinflammatory transcription factors, like IRF8, and its downstream targets, as well as genes encoding proteins involved in pattern recognition and antigen presentation, such as TLR7, TLR8, and H2-D1, potentially providing causal insight regarding arsenics role in perturbing immune responses to infectious diseases. We also observed significant downregulation of genes involved in processes crucial to coordinating a proinflammatory response including leukocyte migration, differentiation, and cytokine and chemokine production and response. Finally, we discovered that 24 X-linked genes were dysregulated in iAs-exposed female stimulation groups compared to only 3 across the iAs-exposed male stimulation groups. These findings elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the sex-differential iAs-associated immune-related disease risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nepicastat is a potent dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor that modulates the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the synthesis of norepinephrine. Nepicastat is a potential drug for the treatment of congestive heart failure. We sought to investigate the mechanistic role of Nepicastsat in the heart of Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats (SHR) rats. Here, we investigated if Nepicastat at both acute (7 days) and chronic administration (14 days) decrease blood pressure and echocardiography parameters in SHR rats. SHR 3-4 months male rats were administered either Nepicastsat (30mg/kg, orally), Enalapril (10 mg/kg, orally), or vehicle for 7 days or 14 days. Blood pressure and echocardiography parameters were recorded on day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 14 of drug administration. The animals were sacrificed, and tissues are collected for histology, qRTPCR, and flow cytometry analysis. At both acute and chronic administration, Nepicastat decreased systolic blood pressure and intraventricular septal thickness of SHR rats compared to vehicle groups. The decrease in blood pressure was comparable to Enalapril treated rats. Interestingly, Nepicastat also decreased the infiltrating macrophages and B cells in the hearts of SHR rats. In conclusion, Nepicastsat consistently decreased the systolic blood pressure but increased the macrophages and B cell infiltration in the heart of SHR rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, and opioids are commonly prescribed for such individuals. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter of chronic pain patients have reported misusing their prescription. We are investigating the effect of chronic pain on drug-seeking behavior at the neuronal level. Repeated drug-seeking is associated with reactivation of an ensemble of neurons sparsely scattered throughout the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Prior research has demonstrated that chronic pain increases intrinsic excitability of dmPFC neurons, which may increase the likelihood of reactivation during drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain would increase oxycodone seeking behavior, and that the pain state would differentially increase intrinsic excitability in dmPFC drug seeking ensemble neurons. TetTag mice self-administered intravenous oxycodone. After 7 days of forced abstinence, a drug seeking session (extinction conditions) was performed and the ensemble was tagged. Mice received spared nerve injury (SNI) to induce chronic pain during the period between a first and second seeking session, and we measured persistence of seeking between the two sessions to determine if the SNI exacerbated seeking. Following the second seeking session we performed electrophysiology on individual neurons within the dmPFC to assess intrinsic excitability of the drug-seeking ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. We found significant sex differences in the effect of SNI on oxycodone seeking and electrophysiology, such that the induction of chronic pain could modulate seeking behavior in mice that have previously self-administered oxycodone prior to injury.

HighlightsO_LIOxycodone seeking was higher in females following SNI that came after the 10-day SA timeline.
C_LIO_LIAn increase in intrinsic excitability was detected among non-ensemble neurons from female mice that received SNI, and this correlated with an increase in seeking behavior.
