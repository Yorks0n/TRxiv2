Traditional approaches screen compounds for their ability to shift disease phenotypes toward healthy phenotypes, but these end point-based screens lack an atlas-like mapping between phenotype and cell state that covers the full spectrum of possible phenotypic responses. In this study, we present MitoSpace: a novel mitochondrial phenotypic atlas that leverages self-supervised deep learning to create a semantically meaningful latent space from images without relying on any data labels for training. Our approach employs a dataset of [~]100,000 microscopy images of Cal27 and HeLa cells treated with 25 drugs affecting mitochondria, but can be generalized to any cell type, cell organelle, or drug library with no changes to the methodology. We demonstrate how MitoSpace enhances our understanding of the range of mitochondrial phenotypes induced by pharmacological interventions. We find that i) self-supervised learning can automatically uncover the semantic landscape of drug induced latent mitochondrial phenotypes and can map individual cells to the correct functional area of the drug they are treated with, ii) the traditional classification of mitochondrial morphology along a fragmented to fused axis is more complex than previously thought, with additional axes being identified, and iii) latent spaces trained in a self-supervised manner are superior to those trained with supervised models, and generalize to other cell types and drug conditions without explicit training on those cell types or drug conditions. Future applications of MitoSpace include creating mitochondrial biomarkers for drug discovery and determining the effects of unknown drugs and diseases for diagnostic purposes.\nA Biotin Targeting Chimera (BioTAC) System to Map Small Molecule Interactomes in situ\nAuthors: Tao, A.

M.\nScore: 47.5, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554211\nUnbiased chemical biology strategies for direct readout of protein interactome remodelling by small molecules provide advantages over target-focused approaches, including the ability to detect previously unknown targets, and the inclusion of chemical off-compete controls leading to high-confidence identifications. We describe the BioTAC system, a small-molecule guided proximity labelling platform, to rapidly identify both direct and complexed small molecule binding proteins. The BioTAC system overcomes a limitation of current approaches, and supports identification of both inhibitor bound and molecular glue bound complexes.\nAcute and sub-chronic toxicity of aqueous stem-bark extract of Annickia polycarpa\nAuthors: Lartey, N. L.; Nyarko, E. N.; Asare-Anane, H.; Antwi, S.; Okine, L. K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557718\nBackground and aimThe lack of standardization and scientific validation of the use of most plant extracts leads to toxicity problems. The stem bark extract of Annickia polycarpa has been shown to possess antioxidant, antidiabetic, analgesic, and anti-colitis effects. However, nothing is known about the effects of the prolonged use of the extract. Thus, we investigated the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the aqueous stem bark extract of (APE) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental procedureThe LD50 and sub-chronic toxicity of APE (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) was studied over 3 months in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), direct bilirubin and creatinine were measured after 3 months of treatment. Hematological analysis and urinalysis were also performed. Also, the effect of APE on blood clotting time and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time were determined at the termination of treatment. Finally, histological analysis was done on liver, kidney, lung, and heart after hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue cross-sections at the termination of treatment. Results and conclusionThe LD50 of APE in rats was higher than 5000 mg/kg with no observable signs of toxicity. APE also showed no hematotoxic effect when used consistently for 3 months. Additionally, APE had no adverse effect on the liver and kidney evidenced by a lack of effect on serum biochemical parameters (ALP, ALT, direct bilirubin, and creatinine), urinalysis as well as the tissue morphology of these organs. No adverse morphological effects were also observed with the heart muscle cells. However, APE showed mild selective toxicity to the lung characterized by alveolar space closing and interstitial fibrosis and alveolar septa thickening. These results indicate that APE is generally non-toxic at the tested doses but shows mild selective pneumotoxicity when used over a long period of time.\nEffect of ethanolic extract of Cyperus rotundus reduces the surgical induced secondary lymphedema and oxidative stress in adult mice tail\nAuthors: pandey, N.; Mishra, p.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558373\nBackground: Lymphedema is clinically manifested as swelling in the extremities due to abnormal accumulation of protein rich in the extravascular interstitial space resulting in irreversible structural changes to the limb (s). The aim of this explorative work was to evaluate the effect of Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) ethanolic extract in a mouse tail model of secondary lymphedema. Method: Mice were temporally anaesthetised under sterile condition and the skin from the tail was removed from distal part of the trunk after leaving 1cm of distance. The animals were divided into Experimental control (EC) and Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) 80 mg/kg b.w. /day) treated groups. Change in tail volume and circumference were monitored for 20 days. TNF, SOD and catalase were estimated from blood obtained through retro-orbital at day 0, 5, 10 and 15. Further TS of upper part of the tail skin was stained with H\u0026E stain to document histological changes mRNA level of COX-2 was estimated from the skin. RESULTS: EC group showed gradual rise in tail oedema post-surgery (PS), elevated inflammation, oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. However in CRR (80 mg/kg b.w./day) treated group shown the reduced tail oedema after post-surgery. TNF, SOD and catalase levels were significantly less in CRR then EC group supporting anti-inflammatory potential. CRR protected the tail from structural damage. It also down regulated the expression of COX-2 in comparison to EC group. Conclusions: CRR ethanolic extract significantly attenuated secondary lymphedema indicating it potential for therapeutic use.\n",

However, nothing is known about the effects of the prolonged use of the extract. Thus, we investigated the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the aqueous stem bark extract of (APE) in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Experimental procedureThe LD50 and sub-chronic toxicity of APE (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) was studied over 3 months in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), direct bilirubin and creatinine were measured after 3 months of treatment. Hematological analysis and urinalysis were also performed. Also, the effect of APE on blood clotting time and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time were determined at the termination of treatment. Finally, histological analysis was done on liver, kidney, lung, and heart after hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue cross-sections at the termination of treatment.

Results and conclusionThe LD50 of APE in rats was higher than 5000 mg/kg with no observable signs of toxicity. APE also showed no hematotoxic effect when used consistently for 3 months. Additionally, APE had no adverse effect on the liver and kidney evidenced by a lack of effect on serum biochemical parameters (ALP, ALT, direct bilirubin, and creatinine), urinalysis as well as the tissue morphology of these organs. No adverse morphological effects were also observed with the heart muscle cells. However, APE showed mild selective toxicity to the lung characterized by alveolar space closing and interstitial fibrosis and alveolar septa thickening. These results indicate that APE is generally non-toxic at the tested doses but shows mild selective pneumotoxicity when used over a long period of time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Lymphedema is clinically manifested as swelling in the extremities due to abnormal accumulation of protein rich in the extravascular interstitial space resulting in irreversible structural changes to the limb (s). The aim of this explorative work was to evaluate the effect of Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) ethanolic extract in a mouse tail model of secondary lymphedema. Method: Mice were temporally anaesthetised under sterile condition and the skin from the tail was removed from distal part of the trunk after leaving 1cm of distance. The animals were divided into Experimental control (EC) and Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) 80 mg/kg b.w. /day) treated groups. Change in tail volume and circumference were monitored for 20 days. TNF, SOD and catalase were estimated from blood obtained through retro-orbital at day 0, 5, 10 and 15. Further TS of upper part of the tail skin was stained with H&amp;E stain to document histological changes mRNA level of COX-2 was estimated from the skin. RESULTS:  EC group showed gradual rise in tail oedema post-surgery (PS), elevated inflammation, oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. However in CRR (80 mg/kg b.w./day) treated group shown the reduced tail oedema after post-surgery. TNF, SOD and catalase levels were significantly less in CRR then EC group supporting anti-inflammatory potential. CRR protected the tail from structural damage. It also down regulated the expression of COX-2 in comparison to EC group. Conclusions: CRR ethanolic extract significantly attenuated secondary lymphedema indicating it potential for therapeutic use.</p>
