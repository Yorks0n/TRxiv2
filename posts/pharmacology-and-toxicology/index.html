A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

K.; Barr, P. J.; Connor, M.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551199\nIntroductionCannabichromene (CBC) is a minor constituent of Cannabis that is a selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist and activator of TRPA1. To date, it has not been shown whether (-)-CBC, (+)-CBC (or both) can mediate these effects. In this study we investigate the activity of the CBC enantiomers at CB1, CB2 and TRPA1 in vitro. Materials and MethodsCBC enantiomers were purified from synthetic CBC by chiral chromatography, and their optical activity was confirmed by spectroscopy. Human CB1 and CB2 receptor activity was measured using a fluorescent assay of membrane potential in stably transfected AtT20 cells. TRPA1 activation was measured using a fluorescent assay of intracellular calcium in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Results(-)-CBC activated CB2 with an EC50 of 1.5 {micro}M, to a maximum of 60 % of CP55940. (+)-CBC did not activate CB2 at concentrations up to 30 {micro}M. Only 30 {micro}M (-)- CBC produced detectable activation of CB1, (+)-CBC was inactive. Both (-)-CBC and (+)- CBC activated TRPA1; at 30 {micro}M (-)-CBC produced an activation 50% of that of the reference agonist cinnamaldehyde (300 {micro}M), 30 {micro}M (+)-CBC activated TRPA1 to 38% of the cinnamaldehyde maximum. DiscussionIt is unclear whether (-)-CBC is the sole or even the predominant enantiomer of CBC enzymatically synthesized in Cannabis. This study shows that (-)-CBC is the active isomer at CB2 receptors, while both isomers activate TRPA1. The results suggest that medicinal preparations of CBC that target cannabinoid receptors would be most effective when (-)-CBC is the dominant isomer.\nA new paradigm of intracrine free fatty acid receptor 4 signaling at lipid droplets\nAuthors: Calebiro, D.; O'Brien, S. L.; Tripp, E.; Smith, G.; Boufersaoui, A.; Roberts, J.; Pike, J. A.; Correia, J.; Miljus, T. A.; Tennant, D. A.; Hudson, B. D.; Milligan, G.; Gerhart-Hines, Z.; Schwartz, T. W.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550805\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), once thought to be active exclusively at the plasma membrane, have been shown to signal from multiple intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes and the Golgi. However, the potential occurrence and functional relevance of intracellular signaling for the emerging family of metabolite-sensing GPCRs is largely unknown. Here, we used live-cell imaging, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements, and functional readouts to investigate signal compartmentalization of the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR that is activated by medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs). Unexpectedly, we show that FFA4 largely resides on intracellular membranes that are intimately associated with lipid droplets in adipocytes. Upon lipolysis induction, the released FFAs rapidly bind to and activate this intracellular pool of FFA4, leading to local Gi/o coupling and inhibition of cAMP production in the vicinity of lipid droplets. This provides a spatiotemporally confined negative feedback mechanism allowing individual lipid droplets to rapidly adjust their lipolysis rate. Our results reveal a novel intracrine signaling modality by a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR and identify a new lipid-droplet-associated signaling hub implicated in the rapid regulation of lipid metabolism, with important implications for adipocyte physiology and pharmacology.\nMachine learning models for prediction of xenobiotic chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk\nAuthors: Vijayaraghavan, S.; Lakshminarayanan, A.; Bhargava, N.; Ravichandran, J.; Vivek-Ananth, R. P.; Samal, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552173\nBreast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.\nMolecular pharmacology of selective NaV1.6 and dual NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channel inhibitors that suppress excitatory neuronal activity ex vivo\nAuthors: Goodchild, S. J.; Shuart, N. G.; Williams, A. D.; Ye, W.; Parrish, R. R.; Soriano, M.; Thouta, S.; Mezeyova, J.; Waldbrook, M.; Dean, R. A.; Focken, T.; Ghovanloo, M.-R.; Ruben, P. C.; Scott, F.; Cohen, C. J.; Empfield, J. R.; Johnson, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551643\nSodium channel inhibitors are used to treat neurological disorders of hyperexcitability. However, all currently available sodium channel targeting anti-seizure medications are non-selective among the NaV isoforms which potentially limits efficacy and therapeutic safety margins. XPC-7724 and XPC-5462 represent a new class of small molecule compounds. These compounds target inhibition of the NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channels in excitatory pyramidal neurons and possess a molecular selectivity of \u003e100 fold against NaV1.1 channels that are dominant in inhibitory cells. This profile will enable pharmacological dissection of the physiological roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and help to define the role of each channel in disease states. These compounds bind to and stabilize the inactivated-state of the channels, demonstrate higher potency with longer residency times, and slower off-rates than carbamazepine and phenytoin. These compounds possess cellular selectivity ex vivo in inhibiting action potential firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons, whilst sparing fast spiking inhibitory interneurons. XPC-5462 also suppresses epileptiform activity in an ex vivo brain slice seizure model. This class of compounds provides a unique approach for treating neuronal excitability disorders by selectively down-regulating excitatory circuits.\nDetermining the shelf life of an erythropoietin alfa biosimilar GBPD002 through stability study\nAuthors: Nag, K.; Mohiuddin, M.; Kumar, S.; Khan, M.

H.; Sarker, S.; Alam, M. F.; Sultana, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552105\nGBPD002 is a recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cell expression system. In this study, samples were analyzed according to current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) and regulatory guidelines to evaluate the quality of the product under the influence of variety of environmental factors in a time-dependent manner. Accelerated (25 +/- 2 degree Celsius and relative humidity: 60 +/- 5 %) and real-time (5 +/- 3 degree Celsius) stability study were conducted up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively; samples were analyzed in every 3 months. After 12 months, real-time stability studies were performed with 6 months interval up to 18 months, which to be continued up to 24 months. Appearance and pH were assessed using standard methods, and molecular weight was determined by Western blotting. Chromatographic identification and quantitative assays were performed by reversed-phase chromatography (RPC). High-molecular weight aggregates and degradants were determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. Biofunctionality of the samples were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays. Bacterial endotoxin and sterility test were performed as safety parameters. All samples met the acceptance criteria, and the data were extrapolated using the regulatory guideline to determine the shelf life. The data revealed that the GBPD002 is stable up to 24 months.\nOptical Control of G-Actin with a Photoswitchable Latrunculin\nAuthors: Veprek, N. A.; Cooper, M. H.; Laprell, L.; Yang, E. J.-N.; Folkerts, S.; Bao, R.; Oertner, T. G.; Pon, L. A.; Zuchero, J. B.; Trauner, D. H.\nScore: 23.4, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549222\nActin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">RNA splicing modulators are a new class of small molecules with the potential to modify the expression levels of proteins. A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionCannabichromene (CBC) is a minor constituent of Cannabis that is a selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist and activator of TRPA1. To date, it has not been shown whether (-)-CBC, (&#43;)-CBC (or both) can mediate these effects. In this study we investigate the activity of the CBC enantiomers at CB1, CB2 and TRPA1 in vitro.

Materials and MethodsCBC enantiomers were purified from synthetic CBC by chiral chromatography, and their optical activity was confirmed by spectroscopy. Human CB1 and CB2 receptor activity was measured using a fluorescent assay of membrane potential in stably transfected AtT20 cells. TRPA1 activation was measured using a fluorescent assay of intracellular calcium in stably transfected HEK293 cells.

Results(-)-CBC activated CB2 with an EC50 of 1.5 {micro}M, to a maximum of 60 % of CP55940. (&#43;)-CBC did not activate CB2 at concentrations up to 30 {micro}M. Only 30 {micro}M (-)- CBC produced detectable activation of CB1, (&#43;)-CBC was inactive. Both (-)-CBC and (&#43;)- CBC activated TRPA1; at 30 {micro}M (-)-CBC produced an activation 50% of that of the reference agonist cinnamaldehyde (300 {micro}M), 30 {micro}M (&#43;)-CBC activated TRPA1 to 38% of the cinnamaldehyde maximum.

DiscussionIt is unclear whether (-)-CBC is the sole or even the predominant enantiomer of CBC enzymatically synthesized in Cannabis. This study shows that (-)-CBC is the active isomer at CB2 receptors, while both isomers activate TRPA1. The results suggest that medicinal preparations of CBC that target cannabinoid receptors would be most effective when (-)-CBC is the dominant isomer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), once thought to be active exclusively at the plasma membrane, have been shown to signal from multiple intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes and the Golgi. However, the potential occurrence and functional relevance of intracellular signaling for the emerging family of metabolite-sensing GPCRs is largely unknown. Here, we used live-cell imaging, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements, and functional readouts to investigate signal compartmentalization of the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFA4), a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR that is activated by medium- and long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs). Unexpectedly, we show that FFA4 largely resides on intracellular membranes that are intimately associated with lipid droplets in adipocytes. Upon lipolysis induction, the released FFAs rapidly bind to and activate this intracellular pool of FFA4, leading to local Gi/o coupling and inhibition of cAMP production in the vicinity of lipid droplets. This provides a spatiotemporally confined negative feedback mechanism allowing individual lipid droplets to rapidly adjust their lipolysis rate. Our results reveal a novel  intracrine signaling modality by a prototypical metabolite-sensing GPCR and identify a new lipid-droplet-associated signaling hub implicated in the rapid regulation of lipid metabolism, with important implications for adipocyte physiology and pharmacology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Breast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sodium channel inhibitors are used to treat neurological disorders of hyperexcitability. However, all currently available sodium channel targeting anti-seizure medications are non-selective among the NaV isoforms which potentially limits efficacy and therapeutic safety margins. XPC-7724 and XPC-5462 represent a new class of small molecule compounds. These compounds target inhibition of the NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channels in excitatory pyramidal neurons and possess a molecular selectivity of &gt;100 fold against NaV1.1 channels that are dominant in inhibitory cells. This profile will enable pharmacological dissection of the physiological roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and help to define the role of each channel in disease states. These compounds bind to and stabilize the inactivated-state of the channels, demonstrate higher potency with longer residency times, and slower off-rates than carbamazepine and phenytoin. These compounds possess cellular selectivity ex vivo in inhibiting action potential firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons, whilst sparing fast spiking inhibitory interneurons. XPC-5462 also suppresses epileptiform activity in an ex vivo brain slice seizure model. This class of compounds provides a unique approach for treating neuronal excitability disorders by selectively down-regulating excitatory circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">GBPD002 is a recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian cell expression system. In this study, samples were analyzed according to current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) and regulatory guidelines to evaluate the quality of the product under the influence of variety of environmental factors in a time-dependent manner. Accelerated (25 &#43;/- 2 degree Celsius and relative humidity: 60 &#43;/- 5 %) and real-time (5 &#43;/- 3 degree Celsius) stability study were conducted up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively; samples were analyzed in every 3 months. After 12 months, real-time stability studies were performed with 6 months interval up to 18 months, which to be continued up to 24 months. Appearance and pH were assessed using standard methods, and molecular weight was determined by Western blotting. Chromatographic identification and quantitative assays were performed by reversed-phase chromatography (RPC). High-molecular weight aggregates and degradants were determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. Biofunctionality of the samples were evaluated by in vitro and in vivo bioassays. Bacterial endotoxin and sterility test were performed as safety parameters. All samples met the acceptance criteria, and the data were extrapolated using the regulatory guideline to determine the shelf life. The data revealed that the GBPD002 is stable up to 24 months.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.</p>
