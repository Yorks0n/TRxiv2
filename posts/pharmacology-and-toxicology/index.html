M.; Nagar, P.; Nazeer, A.; Godbole, A.; Sahu, B. S.; Upadhyay, S.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565080\nBackground and aim: Huntington's Disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by misfolded mutant huntingtin proteins with expanded stretches of polyglutamines aggregating and destroying cells in the nervous system. Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus are medicinal plants used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat neurological disorders. Here, we tested the effectiveness of extracts of both medicinal plants in decreasing aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein in models of Huntington's Disease and explored the mode of action. Experimental procedure: We used two models, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and a transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, both expressing mutant huntingtin proteins with elongated polyglutamines. We assessed the effect of Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus on mutant huntingtin protein aggregation in both models, and additionally used the cell line for mechanistic studies to identify cellular pathways underlying the effects of treatment. Results and conclusion: Here, we show that an extract of Sida cordifolia inhibits aggregation of mutant huntingtin proteins. In the C. elegans model, the extract prolonged life span and improved motility of the nematode by reducing aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein. Acorus calamus did not exhibit these effects. In the transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, the extract decreased aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein by suppressing key pathways in the ER stress response caused by the mutant protein. Our results highlight the potential therapeutic value of Sida cordifolia and its promise as a source for novel medications.\nOxycodone Self-Administration in Female Rats is Enhanced by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not by Cannabidiol, in a Progressive Ratio Procedure\nAuthors: Nguyen, J. D.; Grant, Y.; Yang, C.; Gutierrez, A.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564282\nEpidemiological evidence suggests that the legalization of cannabis may reduce opioid-related harms. Preclinical evidence of neuropharmacological interactions of endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems prompts further investigation of cannabinoids as potential therapeutics for the non-medical use of opioids. In these studies female rats, previously trained to self-administer oxycodone (0.15 mg/kg/infusion) intravenously in 6 h sessions, were allowed to self-administer oxycodone after exposure to cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by vapor inhalation and THC by injection (5.0-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Self-administration was characterized under Progressive Ratio (PR) and Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedules of reinforcement in 3 h sessions. THC decreased IVSA of oxycodone in a FR procedure but increased reward seeking in a PR procedure. CBD decreased the IVSA of oxycodone in the FR but not the PR procedure. The results are consistent with an anti-reward effect of CBD but suggest THC acts to increase the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in this procedure.\nTargeting cancer with small molecule pan-KRAS degraders\nAuthors: Popow, J.; Farnaby, W.; Gollner, A.; Kofink, C.; Fischer, G.; Wurm, M.; Zollman, D.; Wijaya, A.; Mischerikow, N.; Hasenoehrl, C.; Prokofeva, P.; Arnhof, H.; Arce-Solano, S.; Bell, S.; Boeck, G.; Diers, E.; Frost, A.

A.; McLennan, R.; Olt, S.; Peter, D.; Petermann, O.; Roessler, V.; Stolt-Bergner, P.; Strack, P.; Strauss, E.; Trainor, N.; Vetma, V.; Whitworth, C.; Zhong, S.; Quant, J.; Weinstabl, H.; Küster, B.; Ettmayer, P.; Ciulli, A.\nScore: 46.7, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563163\nDespite the high prevalence of cancers driven by KRAS mutations, to date only the G12C mutation has been clinically proven to be druggable via covalent targeting of the mutated cysteine amino acid residue1. However, in many cancer indications other KRAS mutations, such as G12D and -V, are far more prevalent and small molecule concepts that can address a wider variety of oncogenic KRAS alleles are in high clinical demand2. Here we show that a single small molecule can be used to simultaneously and potently degrade 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles, including those not yet tractable by inhibitors. Compared with inhibition, degradation of oncogenic KRAS results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines. As a result, KRAS degraders inhibit growth of the majority of cancer cell lines driven by KRAS mutations while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS leads to tumour regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path towards addressing KRAS driven cancers with small molecule degraders.\nAntiproliferative Activity of Cephalotaxus Esters: Overcoming Chemoresistance in Cancer Therapy\nAuthors: Yong-Gonzalez, V.; Radu, C.; Calder, P. A.; Shum, D.; Frattini, M. G.; Djaballah, H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565820\nOmacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of Homoharringtonine (HHT), was approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previously, we published the synthesis of this natural alkaloid and three of its derivatives: deoxyharringtonine (DHT), deoxyhomoharringtonine (DHHT), and bis(demethyl)-deoxyharringtonine (BDHT); and reported on its refractory activity against the HL-60/RV+ cells over-expressing P-glycoprotein 1 (MDR1). In this study, we explored the extent of this resistance by first expanding the panel of established cell lines and second, using a panel of 21 leukemia patient derived primary cells. Here, we report a consistent resistance to HTT in K562 derived cells and in MES-SA/MX2 derived cells resistant to mitoxanthrone; all of them over-express MDR1, while we found U87MG-ABCG2 and H69AR cells to be very sensitive to HTT. In contrast, DHT, DHHT, and BDHT seemingly overcome this resistance due to the changes made to the acyl chain of HTT rendering the derivatives less susceptible to efflux. Surprisingly, the leukemia primary cells were very sensitive to HHT and its derivatives with low nanomolar potencies, followed by a new class of CDC7 kinase inhibitors, the anthracycline class of topoisomerase inhibitors, the DNA intercalator actinomycin-D, and the vinca alkaloid class of microtubule inhibitors. The mechanism of cell death induced by HTT and DHHT was found to be mediated via Caspase 3 cleavage leading to apoptosis. Taken together, our results confirm that HHT is a substrate for MDR1. It opens the door to a new opportunity to clinically evaluate HHT and its derivatives for the treatment of AML and other cancers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Despite the high prevalence of cancers driven by KRAS mutations, to date only the G12C mutation has been clinically proven to be druggable via covalent targeting of the mutated cysteine amino acid residue1. However, in many cancer indications other KRAS mutations, such as G12D and -V, are far more prevalent and small molecule concepts that can address a wider variety of oncogenic KRAS alleles are in high clinical demand2. Here we show that a single small molecule can be used to simultaneously and potently degrade 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles, including those not yet tractable by inhibitors. Compared with inhibition, degradation of oncogenic KRAS results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines. As a result, KRAS degraders inhibit growth of the majority of cancer cell lines driven by KRAS mutations while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS leads to tumour regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path towards addressing KRAS driven cancers with small molecule degraders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Omacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of Homoharringtonine (HHT), was approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previously, we published the synthesis of this natural alkaloid and three of its derivatives: deoxyharringtonine (DHT), deoxyhomoharringtonine (DHHT), and bis(demethyl)-deoxyharringtonine (BDHT); and reported on its refractory activity against the HL-60/RV&#43; cells over-expressing P-glycoprotein 1 (MDR1). In this study, we explored the extent of this resistance by first expanding the panel of established cell lines and second, using a panel of 21 leukemia patient derived primary cells. Here, we report a consistent resistance to HTT in K562 derived cells and in MES-SA/MX2 derived cells resistant to mitoxanthrone; all of them over-express MDR1, while we found U87MG-ABCG2 and H69AR cells to be very sensitive to HTT. In contrast, DHT, DHHT, and BDHT seemingly overcome this resistance due to the changes made to the acyl chain of HTT rendering the derivatives less susceptible to efflux. Surprisingly, the leukemia primary cells were very sensitive to HHT and its derivatives with low nanomolar potencies, followed by a new class of CDC7 kinase inhibitors, the anthracycline class of topoisomerase inhibitors, the DNA intercalator actinomycin-D, and the vinca alkaloid class of microtubule inhibitors. The mechanism of cell death induced by HTT and DHHT was found to be mediated via Caspase 3 cleavage leading to apoptosis. Taken together, our results confirm that HHT is a substrate for MDR1. It opens the door to a new opportunity to clinically evaluate HHT and its derivatives for the treatment of AML and other cancers.</p>
