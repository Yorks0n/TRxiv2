It therefore provides an ample solution to the age-old problem of lossless research. When the pattern is robust and the signal is durable, it is possible to use relatively modest amounts of data to build powerful well-learned models. By constructing a classifier using gradient-boosted machines, it was shown that the model was robust, yielded high quality metrics and demonstrated consistent probability assignments for chemistries that have a suitable chemical backbone qualified for inclusion in antiplasmodic libraries. Critical to model development was the utilization of molecular fingerprinting and extraction of physico-chemical parameters relevant to the mechanism driving antiplasmodic activity. Subsequently, such an approach allows the model to uncover the link between bitterness, molecular structure and therapeutic value. This approach to evaluating antiplasmodic activity in chemistries provides a low-cost tool usable in identifying new classes of molecules for use in reducing malaria morbidity that often affects vulnerable members of the community the most. Additionally, given their relatively broad, low colligation and potent efficacies, these molecules may provide strong safety margins and durability netting high returns for health equity.\nDiscovery of a functionally selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist for the treatment of pain\nAuthors: Ullrich, A.; Schneider, J.; Braz, J. M.; Neu, E.; Staffen, N.; Stanek, M.; Blahova, J.; Hove, T.; Albert, T.; Allikalt, A.; Lober, S.; Bhardwaj, K.; Rodriguez-Rosado, S.; Fink, E. A.; Rasmussen, T.; Hubner, H.; Inoue, A. A.; Shoichet, B. K.; Basbaum, A.; Bottcher, B.; Weikert, D.; Gmeiner, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557127\nThe G protein-coupled serotonin receptor 5-HT1AR mediates antinociception and may serve as a valuable target for the treatment of pain. Starting from a chemical library, ST171, a bitopic chemotype activating 5 HT1AR was evolved. In vitro pharmacological investigations of ST171 revealed potent and selective Gi activation (EC50 = 0.3 nM), with marginal Gs and beta-arrestin recruitment. Preclinical studies in mice showed that ST171 was effective in acute and chronic (inflammatory and neuropathic) pain models, without causing sedation. Comparison of cryo-EM structures of a 5-HT1AR-Gi complex bound to the functionally biased agonist ST171, with a structure bound to the functionally balanced agonist befiradol, showed that both ligands bind to the same orthosteric site, but address different exo-sites. The individual poses are associated with ligand-specific helical dispositions and rearrangements of microdomains. Complementation of these studies with molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to derive structural features associated with the functional selectivity of ST171, a phenomenon that may be crucial to the discovery of more effective and safe GPCR drugs.\nAcute and sub-chronic toxicity of aqueous stem-bark extract of Annickia polycarpa\nAuthors: Lartey, N. L.; Nyarko, E. N.; Asare-Anane, H.; Antwi, S.; Okine, L. K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.557718\nBackground and aim: The lack of standardization and scientific validation of the use of most plant extracts leads to toxicity problems. The stem bark extract of Annickia polycarpa has been shown to possess antioxidant, antidiabetic, analgesic, and anti-colitis effects. However, nothing is known about the effects of the prolonged use of the extract. Thus, we investigated the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the aqueous stem bark extract of (APE) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental procedure: The LD50 and sub-chronic toxicity of APE (20 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg) was studied over 3 months in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), direct bilirubin and creatinine were measured after 3 months of treatment. Hematological analysis and urinalysis were also performed. Also, the effect of APE on blood clotting time and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time were determined at the termination of treatment. Finally, histological analysis was done on the liver, kidney, lung, and heart after hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue cross-sections at the termination of treatment. Results and conclusion: The LD50 of APE in rats was higher than 5000 mg/kg with no observable signs of toxicity. APE also showed no hematotoxic effect when used consistently for 3 months. Additionally, APE had no adverse effect on the liver and kidney evidenced by a lack of effect on serum biochemical parameters (ALP, ALT, direct bilirubin, and creatinine), urinalysis as well as the tissue morphology of these organs. No adverse morphological effects were also observed with the heart muscle cells. However, APE showed mild selective toxicity to the lung characterized by alveolar space closing, interstitial fibrosis, and alveolar septa thickening. These results indicate that APE is generally non-toxic at the tested doses but shows mild selective pneumotoxicity when used over a long period of time.\n",

Finally, histological analysis was done on the liver, kidney, lung, and heart after hematoxylin-eosin staining of tissue cross-sections at the termination of treatment. Results and conclusion: The LD50 of APE in rats was higher than 5000 mg/kg with no observable signs of toxicity. APE also showed no hematotoxic effect when used consistently for 3 months. Additionally, APE had no adverse effect on the liver and kidney evidenced by a lack of effect on serum biochemical parameters (ALP, ALT, direct bilirubin, and creatinine), urinalysis as well as the tissue morphology of these organs. No adverse morphological effects were also observed with the heart muscle cells. However, APE showed mild selective toxicity to the lung characterized by alveolar space closing, interstitial fibrosis, and alveolar septa thickening. These results indicate that APE is generally non-toxic at the tested doses but shows mild selective pneumotoxicity when used over a long period of time.</p>
