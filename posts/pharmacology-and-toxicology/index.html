Traditional approaches screen compounds for their ability to shift disease phenotypes toward healthy phenotypes, but these end point-based screens lack an atlas-like mapping between phenotype and cell state that covers the full spectrum of possible phenotypic responses. In this study, we present MitoSpace: a novel mitochondrial phenotypic atlas that leverages self-supervised deep learning to create a semantically meaningful latent space from images without relying on any data labels for training. Our approach employs a dataset of [~]100,000 microscopy images of Cal27 and HeLa cells treated with 25 drugs affecting mitochondria, but can be generalized to any cell type, cell organelle, or drug library with no changes to the methodology. We demonstrate how MitoSpace enhances our understanding of the range of mitochondrial phenotypes induced by pharmacological interventions. We find that i) self-supervised learning can automatically uncover the semantic landscape of drug induced latent mitochondrial phenotypes and can map individual cells to the correct functional area of the drug they are treated with, ii) the traditional classification of mitochondrial morphology along a fragmented to fused axis is more complex than previously thought, with additional axes being identified, and iii) latent spaces trained in a self-supervised manner are superior to those trained with supervised models, and generalize to other cell types and drug conditions without explicit training on those cell types or drug conditions. Future applications of MitoSpace include creating mitochondrial biomarkers for drug discovery and determining the effects of unknown drugs and diseases for diagnostic purposes.\nTenofovir Activation is Diminished in the Brain and Liver of Creatine Kinase Brain-Type Knockout Mice\nAuthors: Eberhard, C. D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559370\nTenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.\nRole Of The C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) And Its Receptor, C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5) In The Genesis Of Aldosterone-induced Hypertension, Vascular Dysfunction, And End-organ Damage\nAuthors: Costa, R. M.; Cerqueira, D. M.; Bruder do Nascimento, A.; Alves, J. V.; Awata, W. M. C.; Singh, S.; Kufner, A.; Cifuentes-Pagano, E.; Pagano, P. J.; Ho, J.; Bruder-Nascimento, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558020\nBackground: Aldosterone has been described to initiate cardiovascular diseases by triggering exacerbated sterile vascular inflammation. The functions of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) and its receptor, C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5), are well known in infectious diseases, but their roles in the genesis of aldosterone-induced vascular injury and hypertension are unknown. Methods: We analyzed the vascular profile, blood pressure, and renal damage in wild-type (CCR5+/+) and CCR5 knockout (CCR5-/-) mice treated with aldosterone (600 ug/kg/day for 14 days) while receiving 1% saline to drink. Results: Here, we show that CCR5 plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular injury, hypertension, and renal damage. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in CCR5+/+ mice resulted in exaggerated CCL5 circulating levels and vascular CCR5 expression. Aldosterone treatment also triggered vascular injury, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, hypertension, and renal damage. Mice lacking CCR5 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage, hypertension, and renal injury. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CCL5 increased NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, NF{kappa}B activation, and inflammation and reduced nitric oxide production in isolated endothelial cells. These effects were abolished by antagonizing CCR5 with Maraviroc. Finally, aortae incubated with CCL5 displayed severe endothelial dysfunction, which is prevented by blocking Nox1, NF{kappa}B, or with Maraviroc treatment. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that CCL5/CCR5, through activation of NFkB and Nox1, is critically involved in aldosterone-induced vascular and renal damage and hypertension. Our data place CCL5 and CCR5 as potential targets for therapeutic interventions in conditions with aldosterone excess.\nEffect of ethanolic extract of Cyperus rotundus reduces the surgical induced secondary lymphedema and oxidative stress in adult mice tail\nAuthors: pandey, N.; Mishra, p.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558373\nBackgroundLymphedema is clinically manifested as swelling in the extremities due to abnormal accumulation of protein rich in the extravascular interstitial space resulting in irreversible structural changes to the limb (s). The aim of this explorative work was to evaluate the effect of Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) ethanolic extract in a mouse tail model of secondary lymphedema. Method: Mice were temporally anaesthetised under sterile condition and the skin from the tail was removed from distal part of the trunk after leaving 1cm of distance. The animals were divided into Experimental control (EC) and Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) 80 mg/kg b.w. /day) treated groups. Change in tail volume and circumference were monitored for 20 days. TNF, SOD and catalase were estimated from blood obtained through retro-orbital at day 0, 5, 10 and 15. Further TS of upper part of the tail skin was stained with H\u0026E stain to document histological changes mRNA level of COX-2 was estimated from the skin. RESULTSEC group showed gradual rise in tail oedema post-surgery (PS), elevated inflammation, oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. However in CRR (80 mg/kg b.w./day) treated group shown the reduced tail oedema after post-surgery. TNF, SOD and catalase levels were significantly less in CRR then EC group supporting anti-inflammatory potential. CRR protected the tail from structural damage. It also down regulated the expression of COX-2 in comparison to EC group. Conclusions: CRR ethanolic extract significantly attenuated secondary lymphedema indicating it potential for therapeutic use.

Among them, copper pyrithione (CuPT) is used, but its mechanisms of toxicity remain little known. This project aimed to identify and measure the impacts of aqueous exposure to CuPT, an organic compound, and compare it to ionic Cu2+ added in the form of its inorganic salt CuSO4, in equivalent Cu2+ molar concentrations, on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles under controlled laboratory conditions. A 24-hour acute exposure was performed with nominal concentrations of 50 and 100 g/L Cu from either CuSO4 or CuPT (labelled CuSO4_50, CuSO4_100, CuPT_50 and CuPT_100, respectively). The CuPT_100 condition induced 85 % mortality in 15 hours and the CuPT_50 condition induced 5 % mortality in the same period. A chronic exposure was then performed with nominal concentrations of 1 and 10 g/L Cu from CuPT and 10 g/L Cu2+ from CuSO4 (labelled CuSO4_1, CuSO4_10, CuPT_1 and CuPT_10, respectively). Measured aqueous concentrations of Cu2+ were slightly higher than nominal concentrations for the lower concentrations, but lower for the CuPT_10 condition. The 8- and 16-day toxicokinetics showed a greater accumulation of copper in the gills of fish exposed to CuPT compared to fish exposed to Cu2+ from CuSO4. The CuPT_10 condition induced 35 and 38 % mortality after 8 and 16 days of exposure, while no mortality was observed in the CuSO4_10 condition. The growth of juveniles was not impacted during the 16 days of exposure for any condition. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx) did not respond to exposure to either contaminant. The expression of genes involved in the antioxidant response (sod1, sod2, gpx), detoxification (cyp1a, mt1x, mt2x), Cu transport (ctr1, ctr2, slc11a2), energy metabolism (coAc, cox, 12S) and cell cycle regulation (bax) strongly decreased at Day 8 in the gills and at Day 16 in the liver of CuPT-exposed fish in comparison to controls at the same time point. This study clearly showed that the toxicity of Cu in the form of CuPT was much higher than that of ionic Cu from CuSO4 and provides new information on the compound that will be useful to develop regulations concerning its use and release in the aquatic environment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Aldosterone has been described to initiate cardiovascular diseases by triggering exacerbated sterile vascular inflammation. The functions of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) and its receptor, C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5), are well known in infectious diseases, but their roles in the genesis of aldosterone-induced vascular injury and hypertension are unknown. Methods: We analyzed the vascular profile, blood pressure, and renal damage in wild-type (CCR5&#43;/&#43;) and CCR5 knockout (CCR5-/-) mice treated with aldosterone (600 ug/kg/day for 14 days) while receiving 1% saline to drink. Results: Here, we show that CCR5 plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular injury, hypertension, and renal damage. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in CCR5&#43;/&#43; mice resulted in exaggerated CCL5 circulating levels and vascular CCR5 expression. Aldosterone treatment also triggered vascular injury, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, hypertension, and renal damage. Mice lacking CCR5 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage, hypertension, and renal injury. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CCL5 increased NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, NF{kappa}B activation, and inflammation and reduced nitric oxide production in isolated endothelial cells. These effects were abolished by antagonizing CCR5 with Maraviroc. Finally, aortae incubated with CCL5 displayed severe endothelial dysfunction, which is prevented by blocking Nox1, NF{kappa}B, or with Maraviroc treatment. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that CCL5/CCR5, through activation of NFkB and Nox1, is critically involved in aldosterone-induced vascular and renal damage and hypertension. Our data place CCL5 and CCR5 as potential targets for therapeutic interventions in conditions with aldosterone excess.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLymphedema is clinically manifested as swelling in the extremities due to abnormal accumulation of protein rich in the extravascular interstitial space resulting in irreversible structural changes to the limb (s). The aim of this explorative work was to evaluate the effect of Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) ethanolic extract in a mouse tail model of secondary lymphedema. Method: Mice were temporally anaesthetised under sterile condition and the skin from the tail was removed from distal part of the trunk after leaving 1cm of distance. The animals were divided into Experimental control (EC) and Cyperus rotundus root (CRR) 80 mg/kg b.w. /day) treated groups. Change in tail volume and circumference were monitored for 20 days. TNF, SOD and catalase were estimated from blood obtained through retro-orbital at day 0, 5, 10 and 15. Further TS of upper part of the tail skin was stained with H&amp;E stain to document histological changes mRNA level of COX-2 was estimated from the skin.

RESULTSEC group showed gradual rise in tail oedema post-surgery (PS), elevated inflammation, oxidative stress and histopathological alterations. However in CRR (80 mg/kg b.w./day) treated group shown the reduced tail oedema after post-surgery. TNF, SOD and catalase levels were significantly less in CRR then EC group supporting anti-inflammatory potential. CRR protected the tail from structural damage. It also down regulated the expression of COX-2 in comparison to EC group. Conclusions: CRR ethanolic extract significantly attenuated secondary lymphedema indicating it potential for therapeutic use.

        <p class="abstract">Since the global ban on tributyltin in antifouling paints in 2008 by the International Maritime Organization, new products have been developed and brought to the market. Among them, copper pyrithione (CuPT) is used, but its mechanisms of toxicity remain little known. This project aimed to identify and measure the impacts of aqueous exposure to CuPT, an organic compound, and compare it to ionic Cu2&#43; added in the form of its inorganic salt CuSO4, in equivalent Cu2&#43; molar concentrations, on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles under controlled laboratory conditions. A 24-hour acute exposure was performed with nominal concentrations of 50 and 100 g/L Cu from either CuSO4 or CuPT (labelled CuSO4_50, CuSO4_100, CuPT_50 and CuPT_100, respectively). The CuPT_100 condition induced 85 % mortality in 15 hours and the CuPT_50 condition induced 5 % mortality in the same period. A chronic exposure was then performed with nominal concentrations of 1 and 10 g/L Cu from CuPT and 10 g/L Cu2&#43; from CuSO4 (labelled CuSO4_1, CuSO4_10, CuPT_1 and CuPT_10, respectively). Measured aqueous concentrations of Cu2&#43; were slightly higher than nominal concentrations for the lower concentrations, but lower for the CuPT_10 condition. The 8- and 16-day toxicokinetics showed a greater accumulation of copper in the gills of fish exposed to CuPT compared to fish exposed to Cu2&#43; from CuSO4. The CuPT_10 condition induced 35 and 38 % mortality after 8 and 16 days of exposure, while no mortality was observed in the CuSO4_10 condition. The growth of juveniles was not impacted during the 16 days of exposure for any condition. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx) did not respond to exposure to either contaminant. The expression of genes involved in the antioxidant response (sod1, sod2, gpx), detoxification (cyp1a, mt1x, mt2x), Cu transport (ctr1, ctr2, slc11a2), energy metabolism (coAc, cox, 12S) and cell cycle regulation (bax) strongly decreased at Day 8 in the gills and at Day 16 in the liver of CuPT-exposed fish in comparison to controls at the same time point. This study clearly showed that the toxicity of Cu in the form of CuPT was much higher than that of ionic Cu from CuSO4 and provides new information on the compound that will be useful to develop regulations concerning its use and release in the aquatic environment.</p>
