However, drug design is hampered by the low permeability of the Gram-negative cell envelope and the function of drug efflux pumps, which extrude foreign molecules from the cell. A better understanding of the molecular determinants of compound recognition by efflux pumps is, therefore, essential. Here, we quantitatively analyse the activity of over 73,000 compounds across three strains of E. coli - the wild-type, an efflux-deficient variant, and a hyper-permeable variant - to elucidate the molecular principles of evading efflux pumps. Our results show that, alongside a range of physicochemical features, the presence or absence of specific chemical groups in the compounds substantially increases the probability of avoiding efflux. Furthermore, comparison of our findings with inward permeability data highlights the primary role of efflux in determining drug bioactivity in Gram-negative bacteria.\nSCA44- and SCAR13-associated GRM1 mutations affect metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 function through distinct mechanisms\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Muraleetharan, A.; Gregory, K. J.; Hellyer, S. D.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.545810\nMetabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative CNS disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Clinical reports have identified naturally-occurring mGlu1 mutations in rare SCA subtypes and clinical symptoms of mGlu1 mutations have been described. However, how mutations alter mGlu1 function remains unknown. We explored SCA-associated mutation effects on mGlu1 cell surface expression and canonical signal transduction. Orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) were assessed at two functional endpoints (iCa2+ mobilisation and IP1 accumulation). mGlu1 mutants exhibited differential impacts on receptor expression, with a truncating C-terminus mutation significantly reducing mGlu1 expression. Mutations differentially influenced orthosteric ligand affinity, efficacy, and functional cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Loss-of-function mutations L454F and N885del reduced orthosteric affinity and efficacy, respectively. Gain-of-function Y792C mutant mGlu1 displayed enhanced constitutive activity in IP1 assays, which manifested as reduced orthosteric agonist activity. mGlu1 PAMs restored glutamate potency in iCa2+ mobilisation for loss-of-function mutations, and mGlu1 NAMs displayed enhanced inverse agonist activity at Y792C relative to wild-type mGlu1. Collectively, these data highlight distinct mechanisms by which mGlu1 mutations affect receptor function and show allosteric modulators may present a means to restore aberrant mGlu1 function in rare SCA subtypes.\nCirculating metabolites of Borneolum syntheticum (Bingpian) inhibit foam-cell formation in macrophages induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein\nAuthors: He, R.-r.; Li, H.; Chu, Z.-x.; Wang, F.-q.; Du, F.-f.; Xu, F.; Wang, J.-q.; Wang, T.; Olaleye, O. E.; Cheng, C.; Li, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548303\nCoronary heart disease is caused by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques which narrow the arteries over time. The plaques are formed by cholesterol deposits in the arterial intima and lead to the symptom of angina pectoris. Borneolum syntheticum (Bingpian) has been extensively used as a component in Chinese herbal medicines for cardiovascular diseases. This investigation aimed to examine Bingpian metabolism and its effects on anti-atherosclerotic activities. Major circulating Bingpian compounds were detected in human subjects who received a Bingpian-containing medicine. In vitro and rat studies were also conducted to facilitate the understanding of disposition factors that govern the systemic exposure to Bingpian compounds. Although Bingpian constituents, borneol (1) and isoborneol (2), are efficiently absorbed in the intestine, extensive hepatic first-pass glucuronidation, which is mediated predominantly by UGT2B7, coupled with MRP3 and MRP4-mediated efflux of the glucuronides into the blood, and oxidation, which is mediated by CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A, result in the formation of metabolites borneol-2-O-glucuronide (M1G), isoborneol-2-O-glucuronide (M2G), and camphor (3) as the major circulating Bingpian compounds instead of the unchanged 1 and 2. Glucuronides are predominantly eliminated through renal excretion, which involves both glomerular filtration and OAT3- and OAT4-mediated tubular secretion. Furthermore, M1G, M2G, and 3, as well as 1 and 2, displayed inhibitory effects on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam-cell formation in macrophages. The findings emphasized that the metabolites must be given priority in pharmacodynamic studies of Bingpian. Comprehensive integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies facilitates understanding how Bingpian functions in the body to provide therapeutic benefits.\nDefining the data gap: what do we know about environmental exposure, hazards and risks of pharmaceuticals in the European aquatic environment?\nAuthors: Spilsbury, F. D.; Inostroza, P. A.; Svedberg, P.; Cannata, C.; Ragas, A.; Backhaus, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548305\nActive pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their transformation products inevitably enter waterways where they might cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms. Identifying the potential risks of APIs in the environment is therefore a goal and current strategic direction of environmental management described in the EU Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment and the Green Deal. This is challenged by a paucity of monitoring and ecotoxicity data to adequately describe risks. In this study we analyze measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of APIs from 5933 sites in 25 European countries as documented in the EMPODAT database or collected by the German Environment Agency for the time period between 1997 to 2020. These data were compared with empirical data on the ecotoxicity of APIs from the U.S. EPA ECOTOX database. Although 1763 uniquely identifiable APIs are registered with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for sale in the European Economic Area (EEA), only 312 (17.7%) of these are included in publicly available monitoring data, and only 36 (1.8%) compounds have sufficient ecotoxicological data to perform an EMA-compliant ERA. Among the 27 compounds with sufficient exposure and hazard data to conduct a single substance risk assessment according to EMA guidelines, four compounds (14.8%) had a median risk quotient (RQ) \u003e 1. Endocrine disruptors had the highest median RQ, with 7.0 and 5.6 for 17-ethinyl-estradiol and 17{beta}-estradiol respectively. A comparison of in-silico and empirical data for 72 APIs demonstrated the high protectiveness of the current EMA guidelines, with predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) exceeding median MECs in 98.6% of cases, with a 100-fold median increase. This study describes the data shortfalls hindering an accurate assessment of the risk posed to European waterways by APIs, and identifies 68 APIs for prioritized inclusion in monitoring programs, and 66 APIs requiring ecotoxicity testing to fill current data gaps.

K.; Zhen, A.; Li, P.; Wang, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547363\nPreviously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STINGA230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STINGA230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 [A] resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2,3-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compounds activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STINGA230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STINGA230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macro-phages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.\nAnalytical Method Development for Evaluation of Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution of Thiourea-Based Antivirals through nLC/MS-MS\nAuthors: Kumar, J.; Tyagi, P.; Saini, A. K.; Sharma, D.; Kumar, V.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546831\nThiourea-based antivirals are organosulfur chemical compounds. Due to their various medicinal uses, including antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, they are becoming more popular. In this study, pharmacokinetics, Metabolism, bioavailability, and distribution of thiourea derivatives to organs of rats. Thiourea derivatives, namely DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09, exhibit characteristics similar to those of conventional drugs when evaluated in terms of pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry through in-silico analysis. Then a simple and sensitive analytical method was developed for quantified DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09, using prednisolone as an internal standard (IS) and nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The plasma and tissue samples were preprocessing with acetonitrile before chromatographic separation by C18 column with isocratic elution using a mobile phase of water-methanol (30:70, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. A triplequadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) scanning via an electrospray ionization (ESI) source functioning in negative and positive mode detection. For DSA-00, DSA-02, DSA-09 and, internal standard the optimized mass transition ion-pairs (m/z) for quantification were 297.2, 311.2, 309.09, and 361.19 respectively. Each analytic run required only 15 minutes between injections. The calibration curve for thiourea derivatives showed good linear regression coefficient (R2 \u003e.99) over a range of 1.00-10000 pg/mL except DSA-09. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.00 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions were no more than 10.8%, and relative errors (RE) ranged from 0.5 to 5.98%. The validated method was effectively used to explore the pharmacokinetics of orally administrative thiourea derivatives in rats.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative CNS disorders including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Clinical reports have identified naturally-occurring mGlu1 mutations in rare SCA subtypes and clinical symptoms of mGlu1 mutations have been described. However, how mutations alter mGlu1 function remains unknown. We explored SCA-associated mutation effects on mGlu1 cell surface expression and canonical signal transduction. Orthosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) were assessed at two functional endpoints (iCa2&#43; mobilisation and IP1 accumulation). mGlu1 mutants exhibited differential impacts on receptor expression, with a truncating C-terminus mutation significantly reducing mGlu1 expression. Mutations differentially influenced orthosteric ligand affinity, efficacy, and functional cooperativity between allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Loss-of-function mutations L454F and N885del reduced orthosteric affinity and efficacy, respectively. Gain-of-function Y792C mutant mGlu1 displayed enhanced constitutive activity in IP1 assays, which manifested as reduced orthosteric agonist activity. mGlu1 PAMs restored glutamate potency in iCa2&#43; mobilisation for loss-of-function mutations, and mGlu1 NAMs displayed enhanced inverse agonist activity at Y792C relative to wild-type mGlu1. Collectively, these data highlight distinct mechanisms by which mGlu1 mutations affect receptor function and show allosteric modulators may present a means to restore aberrant mGlu1 function in rare SCA subtypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Coronary heart disease is caused by the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques which narrow the arteries over time. The plaques are formed by cholesterol deposits in the arterial intima and lead to the symptom of angina pectoris. Borneolum syntheticum (Bingpian) has been extensively used as a component in Chinese herbal medicines for cardiovascular diseases. This investigation aimed to examine Bingpian metabolism and its effects on anti-atherosclerotic activities. Major circulating Bingpian compounds were detected in human subjects who received a Bingpian-containing medicine. In vitro and rat studies were also conducted to facilitate the understanding of disposition factors that govern the systemic exposure to Bingpian compounds. Although Bingpian constituents, borneol (1) and isoborneol (2), are efficiently absorbed in the intestine, extensive hepatic first-pass glucuronidation, which is mediated predominantly by UGT2B7, coupled with MRP3 and MRP4-mediated efflux of the glucuronides into the blood, and oxidation, which is mediated by CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and CYP3A, result in the formation of metabolites borneol-2-O-glucuronide (M1G), isoborneol-2-O-glucuronide (M2G), and camphor (3) as the major circulating Bingpian compounds instead of the unchanged 1 and 2. Glucuronides are predominantly eliminated through renal excretion, which involves both glomerular filtration and OAT3- and OAT4-mediated tubular secretion. Furthermore, M1G, M2G, and 3, as well as 1 and 2, displayed inhibitory effects on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam-cell formation in macrophages. The findings emphasized that the metabolites must be given priority in pharmacodynamic studies of Bingpian. Comprehensive integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies facilitates understanding how Bingpian functions in the body to provide therapeutic benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their transformation products inevitably enter waterways where they might cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms. Identifying the potential risks of APIs in the environment is therefore a goal and current strategic direction of environmental management described in the EU Strategic Approach to Pharmaceuticals in the Environment and the Green Deal. This is challenged by a paucity of monitoring and ecotoxicity data to adequately describe risks.

In this study we analyze measured environmental concentrations (MECs) of APIs from 5933 sites in 25 European countries as documented in the EMPODAT database or collected by the German Environment Agency for the time period between 1997 to 2020. These data were compared with empirical data on the ecotoxicity of APIs from the U.S. EPA ECOTOX database. Although 1763 uniquely identifiable APIs are registered with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for sale in the European Economic Area (EEA), only 312 (17.7%) of these are included in publicly available monitoring data, and only 36 (1.8%) compounds have sufficient ecotoxicological data to perform an EMA-compliant ERA. Among the 27 compounds with sufficient exposure and hazard data to conduct a single substance risk assessment according to EMA guidelines, four compounds (14.8%) had a median risk quotient (RQ) &gt; 1. Endocrine disruptors had the highest median RQ, with 7.0 and 5.6 for 17-ethinyl-estradiol and 17{beta}-estradiol respectively.

A comparison of in-silico and empirical data for 72 APIs demonstrated the high protectiveness of the current EMA guidelines, with predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) exceeding median MECs in 98.6% of cases, with a 100-fold median increase.

This study describes the data shortfalls hindering an accurate assessment of the risk posed to European waterways by APIs, and identifies 68 APIs for prioritized inclusion in monitoring programs, and 66 APIs requiring ecotoxicity testing to fill current data gaps.

        <p class="abstract">Previously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STINGA230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STINGA230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 [A] resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2,3-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compounds activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STINGA230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STINGA230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macro-phages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Thiourea-based antivirals are organosulfur chemical compounds. Due to their various medicinal uses, including antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, they are becoming more popular. In this study, pharmacokinetics, Metabolism, bioavailability, and distribution of thiourea derivatives to organs of rats. Thiourea derivatives, namely DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09, exhibit characteristics similar to those of conventional drugs when evaluated in terms of pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal chemistry through in-silico analysis. Then a simple and sensitive analytical method was developed for quantified DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09, using prednisolone as an internal standard (IS) and nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The plasma and tissue samples were preprocessing with acetonitrile before chromatographic separation by C18 column with isocratic elution using a mobile phase of water-methanol (30:70, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. A triplequadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) scanning via an electrospray ionization (ESI) source functioning in negative and positive mode detection. For DSA-00, DSA-02, DSA-09 and, internal standard the optimized mass transition ion-pairs (m/z) for quantification were 297.2, 311.2, 309.09, and 361.19 respectively. Each analytic run required only 15 minutes between injections. The calibration curve for thiourea derivatives showed good linear regression coefficient (R2 &gt;.99) over a range of 1.00-10000 pg/mL except DSA-09. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1.00 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions were no more than 10.8%, and relative errors (RE) ranged from 0.5 to 5.98%. The validated method was effectively used to explore the pharmacokinetics of orally administrative thiourea derivatives in rats.</p>
