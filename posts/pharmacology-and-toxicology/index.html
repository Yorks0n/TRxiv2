M.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552553\nSLC22A10 is classified as an orphan transporter with unknown substrates and function. Here we describe the discovery of the substrate specificity and functional characteristics of SLC22A10. The human SLC22A10 tagged with green fluorescent protein was found to be absent from the plasma membrane, in contrast to the SLC22A10 orthologs found in great apes. Estradiol-17{beta}-glucuronide accumulated in cells expressing great ape SLC22A10 orthologs (over 4-fold, p\u003c0.001). In contrast, human SLC22A10 displayed no uptake function. Sequence alignments revealed two amino acid differences including a proline at position 220 of the human SLC22A10 and a leucine at the same position of great ape orthologs. Site-directed mutagenesis yielding the human SLC22A10-P220L produced a protein with excellent plasma membrane localization and associated uptake function. Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes show human-like sequences at proline 220 position, corroborating that SLC22A10 were rendered nonfunctional during hominin evolution after the divergence from the pan lineage (chimpanzees and bonobos). These findings demonstrate that human SLC22A10 is a unitary pseudogene and was inactivated by a missense mutation that is fixed in humans, whereas orthologs in great apes transport sex steroid conjugates.\nVitamin D deficiency induces erectile dysfunction: role of superoxide\nAuthors: Olivencia, M. A.; Climent, B.; Barreira, B.; Morales-Cano, D.; Sanchez, A.; Fernandez, A.; Garcia-Gomez, B.; Romero-Otero, J.; Rodriguez, C.; Moreno, L.; Prieto, D.; Larriba, M. J.; Cogolludo, A.; Angulo, J.; Perez-Vizcaino, F.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552595\nEpidemiological studies suggest a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and erectile dysfunction (ED) but its causal relationship and the mechanism involved are unclear. Here we demonstrate that isolated corpora cavernosa (CC) from human donors with low vitamin D levels show reduced NO-dependent erectile function. This ED is also reproduced in vitamin D deficient rats and vitamin D receptor knockout mice in vivo and ex vivo and is associated with penile fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency also blunts the response of CC to the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil. CC from deficient rats show increased superoxide and their impaired erectile function is restored by superoxide scavengers. These results suggest that vitamin D deficiency induces ED via increased superoxide production.\nOvariectomy-Induced Arterial Stiffening Differs from Vascular Aging and is Reversed by GPER Activation\nAuthors: Kilanowski-Doroh, I.; McNally, A. B.; Wong, T. J.; Visniauskas, B.; Blessinger, S. A.; Imulinde Sugi, A.; Richard, C.; Diaz, Z.; Horton, A.; Natale, C. A.; Ogola, B. O.; Lindsey, S. H.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552881\nArterial stiffness is a cardiovascular risk factor and dramatically increases as women transition through menopause. The current study assessed whether a mouse model of menopause increases arterial stiffness in a similar manner to aging, and whether activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) could reverse stiffness. Female C57Bl/6J mice were ovariectomized (OVX) at 10 weeks of age or aged to 52 weeks, and some mice were treated with GPER agonists. OVX and aging increased pulse wave velocity to a similar extent independent of changes in blood pressure. Aging increased carotid wall thickness, while OVX increased material stiffness without altering vascular geometry. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that OVX downregulated smooth muscle contractile genes. The enantiomerically pure GPER agonist, LNS8801, reversed stiffness in OVX mice to a greater degree than the racemic agonist G-1. In summary, OVX and aging induced arterial stiffening via potentially different mechanisms. Aging was associated with inward remodeling while OVX induced material stiffness independent of geometry and a loss of the contractile phenotype. This study helps to further our understanding of the impact of menopause on vascular health and identifies LNS8801 as a potential therapy to counteract this detrimental process in women.\nMicrocystin-RR is a biliary toxin selective for neonatal cholangiocytes\nAuthors: Gupta, K.; Chen, D.; Wells, R. G.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552661\nBACKGROUND AND AIMSBiliary atresia is a fibrosing cholangiopathy affecting neonates that is thought to be caused by a prenatal environmental insult to the bile duct. Biliatresone, a plant toxin with an -methylene ketone group, was previously implicated in toxin-induced biliary atresia in Australian livestock, but is found in a limited location and is highly unlikely to be a significant human toxin. We hypothesized that other molecules with -methylene ketone groups, some with the potential for significant human exposure, might also be biliary toxins. APPROACH AND RESULTSWe focused on the family of microcystins, cyclic peptide toxins from blue-green algae that have an -methylene ketone group and are found worldwide, particularly during harmful algal blooms. We found that microcystin-RR, but not 6 other microcystins, caused damage to cell spheroids made using cholangiocytes isolated from 2-3-day-old mice, but not from adult mice. We also found that microcystin- RR caused occlusion of extrahepatic bile duct explants from 2-day-old mice, but not 18-day-old mice. Microcystin-RR caused elevated reactive oxygen species in neonatal cholangiocytes, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine partially prevented microcystin-RR- induced lumen closure, suggesting a role for redox homeostasis in its mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONSThis study highlights the potential for environmental toxins to cause neonatal biliary disease and identifies microcystin-RR acting via increased redox stress as a possible neonatal bile duct toxin.\nRats Chasing the Dragon: A new heroin inhalation method\nAuthors: Gutierrez, A.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552712\nRationaleDespite extensive human use of the inhalation route for ingesting opioids, models in rodents have mostly been limited to parenteral injection and oral dosing. Methods using electronic drug delivery systems (EDDS; \"e-cigarettes\") have shown efficacy in rodent models but these do not faithfully mimic the most popular human inhalation method of heating heroin to the point of vaporization. ObjectiveThis study was designed to determine if direct volatilization of heroin hydrochloride delivers effective heroin doses to rodents. MethodsMiddle aged rats were exposed to vapor created by direct heating of heroin HCl powder in a ceramic e-cigarette type atomizer. Efficacy was determined with a warm water tail withdrawal nociception assay, rectal temperature and self-administration. ResultsTen minutes of inhalation of vaporized heroin slowed response latency in a warm water tail withdrawal assay and increased rectal temperature in male rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Similar antinociceptive effects in female rats were attenuated by the opioid antagonist naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). Female rats made operant responses for heroin vapor in 15-minute sessions, increased their response rate when the reinforcement ratio increased from FR1 to FR5, and further increased their responding when vapor delivery was omitted. Anti-nociceptive effects of self-administered volatilized heroin were of a similar magnitude as those produced by the 10-minute non-contingent exposure. ConclusionsThis study shows that \"chasing the dragon\" methods of inhalation of heroin can be modeled successfully in the rat. Inhalation techniques may be particularly useful for longer term studies deep into middle age of rat species.\nIn vitro toxicity of LiTFSI on Human Renal and Hepatoma Cells\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Sands, M.; Lin, M.; Guelfo, J.; Irudayaraj, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553404\nWe evaluate the cytotoxicity, intracellular redox conditions, apoptosis, and methylation of DNMTs/TETs upon exposure to LiTFSI, a novel PFAS compound commonly found in lithium-ion batteries, on human renal carcinoma cells (A498) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). The MTT assay showed both PFOS and LiTFSI had a dose-dependent effect on A498 and HepG2, with LiTFSI be-ing less toxic. Intracellular redox conditions were assessed with a microplate reader and confocal, which showed a significant decrease in ROS levels and an increase in SOD content in both cells. Exposure to LiTFSI enhanced cell apoptosis, with HepG2 being more susceptible than A498. Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of 19 genes associated with kidney injury, methylation, lipid metabolism and transportation was performed. LiTFSI exposure impacted kidney function by downregulating Acta2 and upregulating Tgfb1, Bcl2l1, Harvcr1, Nfe2l2, and Hes1 expression. LiTFSI exposure also affected the abundance of transcripts associated with DNA methylation by the expression of TET and DNMT genes. Furthermore, LiTFSI exposure induced an increase in lipid anabolism and alterations in lipid catabolism in HepG2. Our results provide new insight on the potential role of a new contaminant, LiTFSI in the regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and methylation in human renal carcinoma and hepatoma cells.\nRNA splicing modulator induces peripheral neuropathy with increased neurofilament light chain levels via p53 signaling\nAuthors: Krach, F.; Boerstler, T.; Reischl, S.; Krumm, L.; Regensburger, M.; Winkler, J.; Winner, B.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551640\nRNA splicing modulators are a new class of small molecules with the potential to modify the expression levels of proteins. A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

R.; Perez Sabino, J. F.; Mendoza Elvira, S.; Ribeiro da Silva, A. J.; Ulloa Rojas, J. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.549066\nObjetiveThis study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of essential oil (EO) from diverse chemotypes of Lippia graveolens against oxytetracycline-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila, which primarily affects the tilapia aquaculture (Oreochromis sp) in Guatemala. MethodologyL. graveolens were collected in three departments in Guatemala, the EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Subsequently, an antimicrobial assay was conducted by screening the disk and dilution susceptibility tests, and evaluation of synergistic interactions among the chemotypes, each test being carried out in triplicate. ResultsThe analysis revealed the presence of twenty-seven compounds in the EO obtained from the chemotypes, the main class being monoterpene. The major constituents identified were cis-Dihydro-{beta}-terpineol (8.84%) in chemotype I, carvacrol (51.82%) in chemotype II, and thymol (79.62%) in chemotype III. All EO chemotypes of L. graveolens demonstrated the ability to inhibit the A. hydrophila growth. Thymol chemotype exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against bacterial growth, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 92.4 {micro}g/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 184.8 {micro}g/mL. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is no synergistic or additive effect when combining different chemotypes of L. graveolens. ConclusionsThis the first report of L. graveolens chemotypes exhibiting antimicrobial activity against oxytetracycline-resistant A. hydrophila. The findings suggest the chemotype thymol could be a potential treatment for infections in the tilapia aquaculture in Guatemala.\nAn in-silico approach to identify bioactive phytochemicals from Houttuynia cordata Thunb. As potential inhibitors of Human Glutathione Reductase\nAuthors: Sangeet, S.; Khan, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553374\nCellular infections underpin the pathogenesis of cancer and malaria. Mitigating cellular oxidative stress via glutathione reductase (GR) inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue. Exploiting the antioxidant-rich Houttuynia cordata Thunb., we investigated natural GR inhibitors. Among 13 docked phytochemicals, Quercetin, Quercitrin, and Sesamin exhibited exceptional GR binding affinities. Molecular Docking analysis highlighted their propensity to precisely target the GR active site. Subsequent 150 ns molecular dynamics simulations corroborated their robust interactions, unveiling dynamic stabilizing effects on the protein structure and bolstering their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, ADME-Tox profiling affirmed their favourable drug-like attributes. These findings underscore H. cordata's reservoir of potent antioxidants, poised to combat various maladies, including malaria and cancer. This study distinctly accentuates the distinctive outcomes and paramount significance of harnessing H. cordata phytochemicals as efficacious antioxidants, unravelling novel therapeutic avenues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">SLC22A10 is classified as an orphan transporter with unknown substrates and function. Here we describe the discovery of the substrate specificity and functional characteristics of SLC22A10. The human SLC22A10 tagged with green fluorescent protein was found to be absent from the plasma membrane, in contrast to the SLC22A10 orthologs found in great apes. Estradiol-17{beta}-glucuronide accumulated in cells expressing great ape SLC22A10 orthologs (over 4-fold, p&lt;0.001). In contrast, human SLC22A10 displayed no uptake function. Sequence alignments revealed two amino acid differences including a proline at position 220 of the human SLC22A10 and a leucine at the same position of great ape orthologs. Site-directed mutagenesis yielding the human SLC22A10-P220L produced a protein with excellent plasma membrane localization and associated uptake function. Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes show human-like sequences at proline 220 position, corroborating that SLC22A10 were rendered nonfunctional during hominin evolution after the divergence from the pan lineage (chimpanzees and bonobos). These findings demonstrate that human SLC22A10 is a unitary pseudogene and was inactivated by a missense mutation that is fixed in humans, whereas orthologs in great apes transport sex steroid conjugates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological studies suggest a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and erectile dysfunction (ED) but its causal relationship and the mechanism involved are unclear. Here we demonstrate that isolated corpora cavernosa (CC) from human donors with low vitamin D levels show reduced NO-dependent erectile function. This ED is also reproduced in vitamin D deficient rats and vitamin D receptor knockout mice in vivo and ex vivo and is associated with penile fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency also blunts the response of CC to the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil. CC from deficient rats show increased superoxide and their impaired erectile function is restored by superoxide scavengers. These results suggest that vitamin D deficiency induces ED via increased superoxide production.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arterial stiffness is a cardiovascular risk factor and dramatically increases as women transition through menopause. The current study assessed whether a mouse model of menopause increases arterial stiffness in a similar manner to aging, and whether activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) could reverse stiffness. Female C57Bl/6J mice were ovariectomized (OVX) at 10 weeks of age or aged to 52 weeks, and some mice were treated with GPER agonists. OVX and aging increased pulse wave velocity to a similar extent independent of changes in blood pressure. Aging increased carotid wall thickness, while OVX increased material stiffness without altering vascular geometry. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that OVX downregulated smooth muscle contractile genes. The enantiomerically pure GPER agonist, LNS8801, reversed stiffness in OVX mice to a greater degree than the racemic agonist G-1. In summary, OVX and aging induced arterial stiffening via potentially different mechanisms. Aging was associated with inward remodeling while OVX induced material stiffness independent of geometry and a loss of the contractile phenotype. This study helps to further our understanding of the impact of menopause on vascular health and identifies LNS8801 as a potential therapy to counteract this detrimental process in women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND AND AIMSBiliary atresia is a fibrosing cholangiopathy affecting neonates that is thought to be caused by a prenatal environmental insult to the bile duct. Biliatresone, a plant toxin with an -methylene ketone group, was previously implicated in toxin-induced biliary atresia in Australian livestock, but is found in a limited location and is highly unlikely to be a significant human toxin. We hypothesized that other molecules with -methylene ketone groups, some with the potential for significant human exposure, might also be biliary toxins.

APPROACH AND RESULTSWe focused on the family of microcystins, cyclic peptide toxins from blue-green algae that have an -methylene ketone group and are found worldwide, particularly during harmful algal blooms. We found that microcystin-RR, but not 6 other microcystins, caused damage to cell spheroids made using cholangiocytes isolated from 2-3-day-old mice, but not from adult mice. We also found that microcystin- RR caused occlusion of extrahepatic bile duct explants from 2-day-old mice, but not 18-day-old mice. Microcystin-RR caused elevated reactive oxygen species in neonatal cholangiocytes, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine partially prevented microcystin-RR- induced lumen closure, suggesting a role for redox homeostasis in its mechanism of action.

CONCLUSIONSThis study highlights the potential for environmental toxins to cause neonatal biliary disease and identifies microcystin-RR acting via increased redox stress as a possible neonatal bile duct toxin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleDespite extensive human use of the inhalation route for ingesting opioids, models in rodents have mostly been limited to parenteral injection and oral dosing. Methods using electronic drug delivery systems (EDDS; &#34;e-cigarettes&#34;) have shown efficacy in rodent models but these do not faithfully mimic the most popular human inhalation method of heating heroin to the point of vaporization.

ObjectiveThis study was designed to determine if direct volatilization of heroin hydrochloride delivers effective heroin doses to rodents.

MethodsMiddle aged rats were exposed to vapor created by direct heating of heroin HCl powder in a ceramic e-cigarette type atomizer. Efficacy was determined with a warm water tail withdrawal nociception assay, rectal temperature and self-administration.

ResultsTen minutes of inhalation of vaporized heroin slowed response latency in a warm water tail withdrawal assay and increased rectal temperature in male rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Similar antinociceptive effects in female rats were attenuated by the opioid antagonist naloxone (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.). Female rats made operant responses for heroin vapor in 15-minute sessions, increased their response rate when the reinforcement ratio increased from FR1 to FR5, and further increased their responding when vapor delivery was omitted. Anti-nociceptive effects of self-administered volatilized heroin were of a similar magnitude as those produced by the 10-minute non-contingent exposure.

ConclusionsThis study shows that &#34;chasing the dragon&#34; methods of inhalation of heroin can be modeled successfully in the rat. Inhalation techniques may be particularly useful for longer term studies deep into middle age of rat species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We evaluate the cytotoxicity, intracellular redox conditions, apoptosis, and methylation of DNMTs/TETs upon exposure to LiTFSI, a novel PFAS compound commonly found in lithium-ion batteries, on human renal carcinoma cells (A498) and hepatoma cells (HepG2). The MTT assay showed both PFOS and LiTFSI had a dose-dependent effect on A498 and HepG2, with LiTFSI be-ing less toxic. Intracellular redox conditions were assessed with a microplate reader and confocal, which showed a significant decrease in ROS levels and an increase in SOD content in both cells. Exposure to LiTFSI enhanced cell apoptosis, with HepG2 being more susceptible than A498. Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of 19 genes associated with kidney injury, methylation, lipid metabolism and transportation was performed. LiTFSI exposure impacted kidney function by downregulating Acta2 and upregulating Tgfb1, Bcl2l1, Harvcr1, Nfe2l2, and Hes1 expression. LiTFSI exposure also affected the abundance of transcripts associated with DNA methylation by the expression of TET and DNMT genes. Furthermore, LiTFSI exposure induced an increase in lipid anabolism and alterations in lipid catabolism in HepG2. Our results provide new insight on the potential role of a new contaminant, LiTFSI in the regulation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and methylation in human renal carcinoma and hepatoma cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA splicing modulators are a new class of small molecules with the potential to modify the expression levels of proteins. A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

        <p class="abstract">ObjetiveThis study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of essential oil (EO) from diverse chemotypes of Lippia graveolens against oxytetracycline-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila, which primarily affects the tilapia aquaculture (Oreochromis sp) in Guatemala.

MethodologyL. graveolens were collected in three departments in Guatemala, the EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Subsequently, an antimicrobial assay was conducted by screening the disk and dilution susceptibility tests, and evaluation of synergistic interactions among the chemotypes, each test being carried out in triplicate.

ResultsThe analysis revealed the presence of twenty-seven compounds in the EO obtained from the chemotypes, the main class being monoterpene. The major constituents identified were cis-Dihydro-{beta}-terpineol (8.84%) in chemotype I, carvacrol (51.82%) in chemotype II, and thymol (79.62%) in chemotype III. All EO chemotypes of L. graveolens demonstrated the ability to inhibit the A. hydrophila growth. Thymol chemotype exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against bacterial growth, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 92.4 {micro}g/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 184.8 {micro}g/mL. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is no synergistic or additive effect when combining different chemotypes of L. graveolens.

ConclusionsThis the first report of L. graveolens chemotypes exhibiting antimicrobial activity against oxytetracycline-resistant A. hydrophila. The findings suggest the chemotype thymol could be a potential treatment for infections in the tilapia aquaculture in Guatemala.</p>

Among 13 docked phytochemicals, Quercetin, Quercitrin, and Sesamin exhibited exceptional GR binding affinities. Molecular Docking analysis highlighted their propensity to precisely target the GR active site. Subsequent 150 ns molecular dynamics simulations corroborated their robust interactions, unveiling dynamic stabilizing effects on the protein structure and bolstering their antioxidant potential. Furthermore, ADME-Tox profiling affirmed their favourable drug-like attributes. These findings underscore H. cordata&#39;s reservoir of potent antioxidants, poised to combat various maladies, including malaria and cancer. This study distinctly accentuates the distinctive outcomes and paramount significance of harnessing H. cordata phytochemicals as efficacious antioxidants, unravelling novel therapeutic avenues.</p>
