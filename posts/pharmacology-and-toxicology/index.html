Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.\nAgonist efficacy at the B2AR is driven by agonist-induced differences in receptor affinity for the Gs protein, not ligand binding kinetics.\nAuthors: Harwood, C. R.; Sykes, D. A.; Redfern-Nichols, T.; Ladds, G.; Briddon, S. J.; Veprintsev, D.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574357\nIntroductionThe {beta}2-adrenoceptor ({beta}2AR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is therapeutically relevant in asthma, whereby {beta}2AR agonists relieve bronchoconstriction. The {beta}2AR is a prototypical GPCR for structural and biophysical studies. However, the molecular basis of agonist efficacy at the {beta}2AR is not understood. We hypothesized that the kinetics of ligand binding and GPCR-G protein interactions could play a role in ligand efficacy. We characterised the molecular pharmacology of a range of {beta}2AR agonists and examined the correlation between ligand and mini-Gs binding kinetics and efficacy. MethodsWe used a Time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) based competition ligand binding assay to measure the affinity and residence times of a range of {beta}2AR agonists binding to the human {beta}2AR. TR-FRET between Lumi4-Tb3+ on the N terminus of the {beta}2AR and fluorescent CA200693 (S)-propranolol-green was measured using a PHERAstar FSX. The ability of these {beta}2AR agonists to activate the heterotrimeric Gs protein was measured using the CASE Gs protein biosensor. This assay senses a reduction in NanoBRET between the nano-luciferase (nLuc) donor on the G subunit and Venus acceptor on the G{psi}, on receptor activation, quantified using the operational model of agonism. NanoBRET was also used to measure interactions between DDM solubilised {beta}2AR-nLuc and purified Venus-mini-Gs. A large excess of unlabelled mini-Gs was used to dissociate the {beta}2AR-nLuc: Venus-mini-Gs complex. ResultsCharacterisation of the molecular pharmacology of seven {beta}2AR agonists showed a broad range of ligand binding affinities (pKi = 4.4 {+/-} 0.09 to 9.2 {+/-} 0.08) and kinetics parameters. There was no correlation between ligand residence times and their ability (log{tau} ) to activate the Gs protein (R2=0.26, p=0.29). However, there were statistically significant differences in the association rate (kon (fast)) (3.36{+/-}0.64x105 to 9.19{+/-} 0.42x105) and affinity (Kd) values of mini-Gs binding to the agonist-{beta}2AR complex (pKd =6.0 to 6.7). Both an increase in ligand driven mini-Gs kon(fast) rate and associated increase in mini-Gs pKd for the receptor, were moderately correlated with efficacy (log{tau} ) (R2 =0.58 and R2 =0.50 respectively). ConclusionsThese data support a model in which agonists of increased efficacy cause the {beta}2AR to adopt a conformation that is more likely to recruit G protein. Conversely, these data did not support a role for agonist binding kinetics in the molecular basis of efficacy.\nSynergistic Modulation of Macrophages by Methotrexate and RELA siRNA Folate-Liposome: A Precision Therapy to Prevent Joint Degradation in Collagen-Induced Arthritic Rats\nAuthors: Nasra, S.; Bhatia, D.; Kumar, A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574006\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.\nLinkers in bitopic agonists shape bias profile among transducers for the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors\nAuthors: Semeano, A.; Garland, R.; Bonifazi, A.; Lee, K. H.; Famiglietti, J.; Zhang, W.; Jo, Y. J.; Battiti, F. O.; Shi, L.; Newman, A. H.; Yano, H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574547\nBitopic ligands bind both orthosteric and allosteric or secondary binding sites within the same receptor, often resulting in improvement of receptor selectivity, potency, and efficacy. In particular, for both agonists and antagonists of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R), the primary therapeutic targets for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, bitopic ligand design has proved advantageous in achieving better pharmacological profiles in vitro. Although the two pharmacophores within a bitopic ligand are typically considered the main drivers of conformational change for a receptor, the role of the linker that connects the two has not yet been systematically studied for its relevance in receptor activity profiles. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of sumanirole and PF592,379-based indole-containing bitopic compounds in agonist activity at D2R and D3R, with a focus on linker chemical space and stereochemistry achieved through testing seven distinct chirally resolved linkers. The current study examines the structure activity relationships (SAR) of these linkers extensively, beyond the conventional level, by characterizing activation of all putative transducers over a 44 min time course. Our multiparametric analysis provides previously unappreciated clarity of linker-dependent effects, highlighting the utility of this applied comprehensive approach and the significance of linker type in the shaping of transducer bias profiles.\nHDAC inhibitor derivatives induce differentiation of leukemic cells through two distinct and separable mechanisms\nAuthors: Kumar, P.; Josa-Cullere, L.; Jackson, T. R.; Bataille, C. J. R.; Vyas, P.; Milne, T. A.; Russell, A. J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.572546\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a haematopoietic malignancy comprising different genetic subtypes with a common hallmark of differentiation arrest. In abnormal haematopoiesis, overcoming the differentiation blockade has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy. In a screen with genetically distinct AML cell lines, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) were observed to cause an upregulation in the expression of CD11b, a myeloid differentiation marker. These caused changes in cell morphology, block in proliferation, and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. To gain insights onto the mechanism of these compounds, we planned to prepare inactive probes devoid of the zinc binding motif. However, these compounds were unexpectedly still able to initiate differentiation, albeit through a distinct target and via a G2 arrest. Subsequent RNA sequencing studies supported the differentiation phenotype for the HDACis and highlighted the role of cell cycle regulatory kinases for the effect observed in the probe molecules. We then showed that these inhibit Aurora A and GSK3 kinases, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for differentiation therapy in AML. Our work supports the importance of properly validating inactive tool compounds and their potential to identify novel targets.\nEffect of RNA m6A methyltransferase activation by a low molecular weight compound on anxiety- and depression-related behaviours, monoamine neurochemistry and striatal gene expression in the rat\nAuthors: Kanarik, M.; Liiver, K.; Skolnaja, M.; Teino, I.; Org, T.; Laugus, K.; Shimmo, R.; Karelson, M.; Saarma, M.; Harro, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574593\nModification of mRNA by methylation is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by affecting the splicing, transport, stability and translation of mRNA. Methylation of adenosine at N6 (m6A) is the most common and most important cellular modification occurring in the mRNA of eukaryotes. Evidence that m6A mRNA methylation is involved in regulation of stress response and that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders is accumulating. We have examined the acute and subchronic (up to 18 days once per day intraperitoneally) effect of the first METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 (methyl-piperazine-2-carboxylate) at two doses (1 and 5 mg/kg) in male and female rats. CHMA1004 had a profound locomotor activating and anxiolytic-like profile in open field and elevated zero-maze tests. In female rats sucrose consumption and swimming in Porsolts test were increased. Nevertheless, CHMA1004 did not exhibit strong psychostimulant-like properties: CHMA1004 had no effect on 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations except that it reduced the baseline difference between male and female animals, and acute drug treatment had no effect on extracellular dopamine levels in striatum. Subchronic CHMA1004 altered ex vivo catecholamine levels in several brain regions. RNA sequencing of female rat striata after subchronic CHMA1004 treatment revealed changes in the expression of a number of genes linked to dopamine neuron viability, neurodegeneration, depression, anxiety and stress response. Conclusively, the first-in-class METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 increased locomotor activity and elicited anxiolytic-like effects after systemic administration, demonstrating tha pharmacological activation of RNA m6A methylation has potential for neuropsychiatric drug development.\n",

Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe {beta}2-adrenoceptor ({beta}2AR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is therapeutically relevant in asthma, whereby {beta}2AR agonists relieve bronchoconstriction. The {beta}2AR is a prototypical GPCR for structural and biophysical studies. However, the molecular basis of agonist efficacy at the {beta}2AR is not understood. We hypothesized that the kinetics of ligand binding and GPCR-G protein interactions could play a role in ligand efficacy. We characterised the molecular pharmacology of a range of {beta}2AR agonists and examined the correlation between ligand and mini-Gs binding kinetics and efficacy.

MethodsWe used a Time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) based competition ligand binding assay to measure the affinity and residence times of a range of {beta}2AR agonists binding to the human {beta}2AR. TR-FRET between Lumi4-Tb3&#43; on the N terminus of the {beta}2AR and fluorescent CA200693 (S)-propranolol-green was measured using a PHERAstar FSX. The ability of these {beta}2AR agonists to activate the heterotrimeric Gs protein was measured using the CASE Gs protein biosensor. This assay senses a reduction in NanoBRET between the nano-luciferase (nLuc) donor on the G subunit and Venus acceptor on the G{psi}, on receptor activation, quantified using the operational model of agonism. NanoBRET was also used to measure interactions between DDM solubilised {beta}2AR-nLuc and purified Venus-mini-Gs. A large excess of unlabelled mini-Gs was used to dissociate the {beta}2AR-nLuc: Venus-mini-Gs complex.

ResultsCharacterisation of the molecular pharmacology of seven {beta}2AR agonists showed a broad range of ligand binding affinities (pKi = 4.4 {&#43;/-} 0.09 to 9.2 {&#43;/-} 0.08) and kinetics parameters. There was no correlation between ligand residence times and their ability (log{tau} ) to activate the Gs protein (R2=0.26, p=0.29). However, there were statistically significant differences in the association rate (kon (fast)) (3.36{&#43;/-}0.64x105 to 9.19{&#43;/-} 0.42x105) and affinity (Kd) values of mini-Gs binding to the agonist-{beta}2AR complex (pKd =6.0 to 6.7). Both an increase in ligand driven mini-Gs kon(fast) rate and associated increase in mini-Gs pKd for the receptor, were moderately correlated with efficacy (log{tau} ) (R2 =0.58 and R2 =0.50 respectively).

ConclusionsThese data support a model in which agonists of increased efficacy cause the {beta}2AR to adopt a conformation that is more likely to recruit G protein. Conversely, these data did not support a role for agonist binding kinetics in the molecular basis of efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bitopic ligands bind both orthosteric and allosteric or secondary binding sites within the same receptor, often resulting in improvement of receptor selectivity, potency, and efficacy. In particular, for both agonists and antagonists of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R), the primary therapeutic targets for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, bitopic ligand design has proved advantageous in achieving better pharmacological profiles in vitro. Although the two pharmacophores within a bitopic ligand are typically considered the main drivers of conformational change for a receptor, the role of the linker that connects the two has not yet been systematically studied for its relevance in receptor activity profiles.

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of sumanirole and PF592,379-based indole-containing bitopic compounds in agonist activity at D2R and D3R, with a focus on linker chemical space and stereochemistry achieved through testing seven distinct chirally resolved linkers. The current study examines the structure activity relationships (SAR) of these linkers extensively, beyond the conventional level, by characterizing activation of all putative transducers over a 44 min time course. Our multiparametric analysis provides previously unappreciated clarity of linker-dependent effects, highlighting the utility of this applied comprehensive approach and the significance of linker type in the shaping of transducer bias profiles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a haematopoietic malignancy comprising different genetic subtypes with a common hallmark of differentiation arrest. In abnormal haematopoiesis, overcoming the differentiation blockade has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy. In a screen with genetically distinct AML cell lines, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) were observed to cause an upregulation in the expression of CD11b, a myeloid differentiation marker. These caused changes in cell morphology, block in proliferation, and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. To gain insights onto the mechanism of these compounds, we planned to prepare inactive probes devoid of the zinc binding motif. However, these compounds were unexpectedly still able to initiate differentiation, albeit through a distinct target and via a G2 arrest. Subsequent RNA sequencing studies supported the differentiation phenotype for the HDACis and highlighted the role of cell cycle regulatory kinases for the effect observed in the probe molecules. We then showed that these inhibit Aurora A and GSK3 kinases, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets for differentiation therapy in AML. Our work supports the importance of properly validating inactive tool compounds and their potential to identify novel targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Modification of mRNA by methylation is involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by affecting the splicing, transport, stability and translation of mRNA. Methylation of adenosine at N6 (m6A) is the most common and most important cellular modification occurring in the mRNA of eukaryotes. Evidence that m6A mRNA methylation is involved in regulation of stress response and that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders is accumulating. We have examined the acute and subchronic (up to 18 days once per day intraperitoneally) effect of the first METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 (methyl-piperazine-2-carboxylate) at two doses (1 and 5 mg/kg) in male and female rats. CHMA1004 had a profound locomotor activating and anxiolytic-like profile in open field and elevated zero-maze tests. In female rats sucrose consumption and swimming in Porsolts test were increased. Nevertheless, CHMA1004 did not exhibit strong psychostimulant-like properties: CHMA1004 had no effect on 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations except that it reduced the baseline difference between male and female animals, and acute drug treatment had no effect on extracellular dopamine levels in striatum. Subchronic CHMA1004 altered ex vivo catecholamine levels in several brain regions. RNA sequencing of female rat striata after subchronic CHMA1004 treatment revealed changes in the expression of a number of genes linked to dopamine neuron viability, neurodegeneration, depression, anxiety and stress response. Conclusively, the first-in-class METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 increased locomotor activity and elicited anxiolytic-like effects after systemic administration, demonstrating tha pharmacological activation of RNA m6A methylation has potential for neuropsychiatric drug development.</p>
