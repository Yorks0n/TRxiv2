C_FIG\nTricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants upregulate VMAT2 activity and rescue disease-causing VMAT2 variants\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Marmouzi, I.; Finnie, P. S.; Stove, S. I.; Bucher, M. L.; Lipina, T. V.; Ramsey, A. J.; Miller, G. W.; Salahpour, A.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561601\nVesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.\nHighly biased agonism for GPCR ligands via nanobody tethering\nAuthors: Sachdev, S.; Creemer, B. A.; Gardella, T. J.; Cheloha, R.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561766\nLigand-induced activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate signaling through multiple distinct pathways with differing biological and physiological outcomes. There is intense interest in understanding how variation in GPCR ligand structure can be used to promote pathway selective signaling (\"biased agonism\") with the goal of promoting desirable responses and avoiding deleterious side effects. Here we present a new approach in which a conventional peptide ligand for the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) is converted from an agonist which induces signaling through all relevant pathways to a compound that is highly selective for a single pathway. This is achieved not through variation in the core structure of the agonist, but rather by linking it to a nanobody tethering agent that binds with high affinity to a separate site on the receptor not involved in signal transduction. The resulting conjugate represents the most biased agonist of PTHR1 reported to date. This approach holds promise for facile generation of pathway selective ligands for other GPCRs.\nCharacterization of Gαs and Gαolf activation by catechol and non-catechol dopamine D1 receptor agonists\nAuthors: Nguyen, A. M.; Semeano, A.; Quach, V.; Inoue, A.; Nichols, D. E.; Yano, H.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560682\nThe dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nBeyond the nucleus: Plastic chemicals activate G protein-coupled receptors\nAuthors: McPartland, M.; Stevens, S.; Bartosova, Z.; Gisnaas Vardeberg, I.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560665\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=84 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/560665v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\"\u003e View larger version (23K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc5776org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f20885org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10d717borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195639a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central mediators of cell signaling and physiological function. Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.\n",

Low glucose induces pro-inflammatory MIF release from macrophages, and pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses the release of MIF. AMPK/ NFB signalling pathway is involved, which may be a new strategy to attenuate the pro-inflammatory response in hypoglycemia.

        <p class="abstract">Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ligand-induced activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate signaling through multiple distinct pathways with differing biological and physiological outcomes. There is intense interest in understanding how variation in GPCR ligand structure can be used to promote pathway selective signaling (&#34;biased agonism&#34;) with the goal of promoting desirable responses and avoiding deleterious side effects. Here we present a new approach in which a conventional peptide ligand for the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) is converted from an agonist which induces signaling through all relevant pathways to a compound that is highly selective for a single pathway. This is achieved not through variation in the core structure of the agonist, but rather by linking it to a nanobody tethering agent that binds with high affinity to a separate site on the receptor not involved in signal transduction. The resulting conjugate represents the most biased agonist of PTHR1 reported to date. This approach holds promise for facile generation of pathway selective ligands for other GPCRs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.</p>
