E.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553289\nThe HIV-1 Nef accessory factor is critical to the viral life cycle in vivo where it promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells and viral persistence. While these features identify Nef as an attractive antiretroviral drug target, Nef lacks enzymatic activity and an active site, complicating development of occupancy-based drugs. Here we describe the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the targeted degradation of Nef. Nef-binding compounds, based on a previously reported hydroxypyrazole core, were coupled to ligands for ubiquitin E3 ligases via flexible linkers. The resulting bivalent PROTACs induced formation of a ternary complex between Nef and the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in ubiquitylation of Nef and proteolytic degradation. Nef-directed PROTACs efficiently rescued Nef-mediated MHC-I and CD4 downregulation in T cells and suppressed HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. Targeted degradation of Nef is anticipated to reverse all HIV-1 Nef functions and may help restore adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 reservoir cells in vivo.\nChlorpheniramine Maleate Displays Multiple Modes of Antiviral Action Against SARS-CoV- 2: A Mechanistic Study\nAuthors: Elshaier, Y. A. M. M.; Mostafa, A.; Valerio-Pascua, F.; Tesch, M. L.; Costin, J. M.; Rahaghi, F. F.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554806\nChlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM) has been identified as a potential antiviral compound against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of CPM on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including viral adsorption, replication inhibition, and virucidal activity. Our findings demonstrate that CPM exhibits antiviral properties by interfering with viral adsorption, replication, and directly inactivating the virus. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between CPM and essential viral proteins, such as the main protease receptor, spike protein receptor, and RNA polymerase. CPMs interactions were primarily hydrophobic in nature, with an additional hydrogen bond formation in the RNA polymerase active site. These results suggest that CPM has the potential to serve as a multitarget antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory viruses. Further investigations are warranted to explore its clinical implications and assess its efficacy in vivo.\nMeisoindigo: An Effective Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Revealed by Yeast System\nAuthors: Grabinski, W.; Kicinska, A.; Kosicka, E.; Baranek-Grabinska, M.; Hejenkowska, E. D.; Budzik, J.; Sliska, P.; Sliwinska, W.; Karachitos, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.555867\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARSCoV- 2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.\nIs the neuropeptide PEN a ligand of GPR83?\nAuthors: Giesecke, Y.; Asimi, V.; Stulberg, V.; Kleinau, G.; Scheerer, P.; Koksch, B.; Groetzinger, C.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555736\nG protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor with predominant expression in the cerebellum and proposed function in the regulation of food intake and in anxiety-like behavior. The neuropeptide PEN has been suggested as a specific GPR83 ligand. However, conflicting reports exist about whether PEN is indeed able to bind and activate GPR83. This study was initiated to evaluate PEN as a potential ligand of GPR83. Employing several second-messenger and other GPCR activation assays as well as a radioligand binding assay, and using multiple GPR83 plasmids and PEN peptides from different sources, no experimental evidence was found to support a role of PEN as a GPR83 ligand.\nNADPH oxidase 4-derived hydrogen peroxide counterbalances testosterone-induced endothelial dysfunction and migration\nAuthors: Alves, J. V.; Costa, R. M.; Awata, W. M.; Bruder-Nascimento, A.; Singh, S.; Tostes, R. C.; Bruder-Nascimento, T.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555550\nBackground: High levels of testosterone (Testo) are associated with cardiovascular risk by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are the major source of ROS in the vasculature in cardiovascular diseases. NOX4 is a unique isotype, which produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and its participation in cardiovascular biology is controversial. So far, it is unclear whether NOX4 protects from Testo-induced endothelial injury. Thus, we hypothesized that supraphysiological levels of Testo induce endothelial NOX4 expression to attenuate endothelial injury. Methods: Human Mesenteric Vascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were treated with Testo (10-7 M) with or without a NOX4 inhibitor [GLX351322 (10-4 M)]. In vivo, 10-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were treated with Testo (10 mg/kg) for 30 days to study endothelial function. Results: Testo increased mRNA and protein levels of NOX4 in HMEC and HUVEC. Testo increased superoxide anion (O2-) and H2O2 production, which were abolished by NOX1 and NOX4 inhibition, respectively. Testo also attenuated bradykinin-induced NO production, which was further impaired by NOX4 inhibition. In vivo, Testo decreased H2O2 production in aortic segments and triggered endothelial dysfunction [decreased relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh)], which was further impaired by GLX351322 and by a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic (EUK134). Finally, Testo led to a dysregulated endothelial cells migration, which was exacerbated by GLX351322. Conclusion: These data indicate that supraphysiological levels of Testo increase the endothelial expression and activity of NOX4 to counterbalance the deleterious effects caused by Testo in endothelial function.\nPraziquantel activates a native cation current in Schistosoma mansoni\nAuthors: Chulkov, E. G.; Rohr, C. M.; Marchant, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554840\nPraziquantel (PZQ), an anthelmintic drug discovered in the 1970s, is still used to treat schistosomiasis and various other infections caused by parasitic flatworms. PZQ causes a triad of phenotypic effects on schistosome worms - rapid depolarization, muscle contraction, and damage throughout the worm tegument. The molecular target mediating these effects has been intimated as a Ca2+-permeable ion channel, but native currents evoked by PZQ have not been reported in any schistosome cell type. The properties of the endogenous PZQ activated conductance therefore remain unknown. Here, invasive electrophysiology was used to probe for responses to PZQ from different locales in a living schistosome worm. No direct response was seen in tegument-derived vesicles, or from the sub-tegumental muscle layer despite the presence of voltage-operated currents. However, PZQ rapidly triggered a sustained, non-selective cation current in recordings from neuronal tissue, targeting both the anterior ganglion and the main longitudinal nerve cord. The biophysical signature of this PZQ-evoked current resolved at single channel resolution matched that of a transient receptor potential ion channel named TRPMPZQ, recently proposed as the molecular target of PZQ. The endogenous PZQ-evoked current was also inhibited by a validated TRPMPZQ antagonist. PZQ therefore is a neuroactive anthelmintic, effecting a robust, depolarization through ion channels with the characteristics of TRPMPZQ. Key Findings / Scope StatementO_LIResponses to the anthelmintic drug, praziquantel (PZQ), were examined using invasive electrophysiology in a living schistosome worm. C_LIO_LIPZQ evoked a cation current in recordings from neuronal tissue C_LIO_LIThe biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of the native PZQ current matched the properties of TRPMPZQ.

        <p class="abstract">Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM) has been identified as a potential antiviral compound against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of CPM on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including viral adsorption, replication inhibition, and virucidal activity. Our findings demonstrate that CPM exhibits antiviral properties by interfering with viral adsorption, replication, and directly inactivating the virus. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between CPM and essential viral proteins, such as the main protease receptor, spike protein receptor, and RNA polymerase. CPMs interactions were primarily hydrophobic in nature, with an additional hydrogen bond formation in the RNA polymerase active site. These results suggest that CPM has the potential to serve as a multitarget antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory viruses. Further investigations are warranted to explore its clinical implications and assess its efficacy in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARSCoV- 2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor with predominant expression in the cerebellum and proposed function in the regulation of food intake and in anxiety-like behavior. The neuropeptide PEN has been suggested as a specific GPR83 ligand. However, conflicting reports exist about whether PEN is indeed able to bind and activate GPR83. This study was initiated to evaluate PEN as a potential ligand of GPR83. Employing several second-messenger and other GPCR activation assays as well as a radioligand binding assay, and using multiple GPR83 plasmids and PEN peptides from different sources, no experimental evidence was found to support a role of PEN as a GPR83 ligand.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: High levels of testosterone (Testo) are associated with cardiovascular risk by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are the major source of ROS in the vasculature in cardiovascular diseases. NOX4 is a unique isotype, which produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and its participation in cardiovascular biology is controversial. So far, it is unclear whether NOX4 protects from Testo-induced endothelial injury. Thus, we hypothesized that supraphysiological levels of Testo induce endothelial NOX4 expression to attenuate endothelial injury. Methods: Human Mesenteric Vascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were treated with Testo (10-7 M) with or without a NOX4 inhibitor [GLX351322 (10-4 M)]. In vivo, 10-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were treated with Testo (10 mg/kg) for 30 days to study endothelial function. Results: Testo increased mRNA and protein levels of NOX4 in HMEC and HUVEC. Testo increased superoxide anion (O2-) and H2O2 production, which were abolished by NOX1 and NOX4 inhibition, respectively. Testo also attenuated bradykinin-induced NO production, which was further impaired by NOX4 inhibition. In vivo, Testo decreased H2O2 production in aortic segments and triggered endothelial dysfunction [decreased relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh)], which was further impaired by GLX351322 and by a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic (EUK134). Finally, Testo led to a dysregulated endothelial cells migration, which was exacerbated by GLX351322. Conclusion: These data indicate that supraphysiological levels of Testo increase the endothelial expression and activity of NOX4 to counterbalance the deleterious effects caused by Testo in endothelial function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Praziquantel (PZQ), an anthelmintic drug discovered in the 1970s, is still used to treat schistosomiasis and various other infections caused by parasitic flatworms. PZQ causes a triad of phenotypic effects on schistosome worms - rapid depolarization, muscle contraction, and damage throughout the worm tegument. The molecular target mediating these effects has been intimated as a Ca2&#43;-permeable ion channel, but native currents evoked by PZQ have not been reported in any schistosome cell type. The properties of the endogenous PZQ activated conductance therefore remain unknown. Here, invasive electrophysiology was used to probe for responses to PZQ from different locales in a living schistosome worm. No direct response was seen in tegument-derived vesicles, or from the sub-tegumental muscle layer despite the presence of voltage-operated currents. However, PZQ rapidly triggered a sustained, non-selective cation current in recordings from neuronal tissue, targeting both the anterior ganglion and the main longitudinal nerve cord. The biophysical signature of this PZQ-evoked current resolved at single channel resolution matched that of a transient receptor potential ion channel named TRPMPZQ, recently proposed as the molecular target of PZQ. The endogenous PZQ-evoked current was also inhibited by a validated TRPMPZQ antagonist. PZQ therefore is a neuroactive anthelmintic, effecting a robust, depolarization through ion channels with the characteristics of TRPMPZQ.
