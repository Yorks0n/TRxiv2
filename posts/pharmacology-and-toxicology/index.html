However, in many cancer indications other KRAS mutations, such as G12D and -V, are far more prevalent and small molecule concepts that can address a wider variety of oncogenic KRAS alleles are in high clinical demand2. Here we show that a single small molecule can be used to simultaneously and potently degrade 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles, including those not yet tractable by inhibitors. Compared with inhibition, degradation of oncogenic KRAS results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines. As a result, KRAS degraders inhibit growth of the majority of cancer cell lines driven by KRAS mutations while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS leads to tumour regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path towards addressing KRAS driven cancers with small molecule degraders.\nDermonecrosis caused by spitting cobra snakebite results from toxin potentiation and is prevented by the repurposed drug varespladib\nAuthors: Bartlett, K. E.; Hall, S. R.; Rasmussen, S. A.; Crittenden, E.; Dawson, C. A.; Albulescu, L.-O.; Laprade, W. M.; Harrison, R. A.; Saviola, A. J.; Modahl, C. M.; Jenkins, T. P.; Wilkinson, M. C.; Gutierrez, J. M.; Casewell, N. R.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549878\nSnakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes substantial mortality and morbidity globally. The venom of African spitting cobras often causes permanent injury via tissue-destructive dermonecrosis at the bite site, which is ineffectively treated by current antivenoms. To address this therapeutic gap, we identified the aetiological venom toxins responsible for causing local dermonecrosis. While cytotoxic three-finger toxins were primarily responsible for causing spitting cobra cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes, their potentiation by phospholipases A2 toxins was essential to cause dermonecrosis in vivo. This evidence of probable toxin synergism suggests that a single toxin-family inhibiting drug could prevent local envenoming. We show that local injection with the repurposed phospholipase A2-inhibiting drug varespladib significantly prevents local tissue damage caused by several spitting cobra venoms in murine models of envenoming. Our findings therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy to more effectively prevent life-changing morbidity caused by snakebite in rural Africa. Significance StatementSpitting cobra venoms cause extensive local tissue damage surrounding the site of a snakebite. This damage cannot be effectively prevented with current antivenom treatments, and patients are often left with life-changing wounds. In this study we used cellular and mouse experiments to determine which toxins in African spitting cobra venom are responsible for causing tissue damage, revealing that a combination of two different types of toxins are required to cause pathology in vivo. We then showed that the repurposed drug, varespladib, which targets one of these toxin types, effectively prevents skin and muscle damage in mouse models of envenoming. Collectively these findings suggest that varespladib could be an effective new type of therapy for preventing snakebite morbidity in Africa.\nDiscovery of a novel inhibitor of macropinocytosis with antiviral activity\nAuthors: Porebski, B.; Christ, W.; Corman, A.; Haraldsson, M.; Barz, M.; Lidemalm, L.; Haggblad, M.; Illmain, J.; Wright, S.; Murga, M.; Schlegel, J.; Sezgin, E.; Bhabha, G.; Lauschke, V.

Here, we report the discovery of a new molecule with antiviral properties that we named virapinib, which limits viral entry by macropinocytosis. The identification of virapinib derives from a chemical screen using High-Throughput Microscopy, where we identified new chemical entities capable of preventing infection with a pseudotype virus expressing the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent experiments confirmed the capacity of virapinib to inhibit infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as by additional viruses, such as Monkeypox virus and TBEV. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the compound inhibited macropinocytosis, limiting this entry route for the viruses. Importantly, virapinib has no significant toxicity to host cells. In summary, we present a new molecule that inhibits viral entry via the endocytic route, offering a new alternative to prevent viral infection.\nPharmacological and behavioral effects of tryptamines present in psilocybin-containing mushrooms\nAuthors: Rakoczy, R. J.; Runge, G. N.; Sen, A. K.; Sandoval, O.; Nguyen, Q.; Roberts, B. R.; Sciortino, J. H.; Gibbons, W. J.; Friedberg, L. M.; Jones, J. A.; McMurray, M. S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563138\nDemand for more efficacious antidepressants, particularly those with a rapid onset of action, has resulted in a reevaluation of psychedelic drugs for their therapeutic potential. Several tryptamines found in psilocybin-containing magic mushrooms share chemical similarities with psilocybin, and early work suggests they may also share receptor targets. However, few studies have explored their pharmacological and behavioral effects. To accomplish this, we compared baeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin with psilocybin to determine if they are metabolized by the same enzymes, penetrate the blood brain barrier, serve as ligands for similar centrally located receptors, and modulate behavior in rodents similarly. We first assessed the stability and optimal storage and handling conditions for each compound. In vitro enzyme kinetics assays then found that all compounds shared nearly identical rates of dephosphorylation via alkaline phosphatase and metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Further, we found that only the dephosphorylated products of baeocystin and norbaeocystin could cross a blood brain barrier mimetic to a similar degree as the dephosphorylated form of psilocybin, psilocin. Behaviorally, only psilocybin was found to induce head twitch responses in rats, a marker of 5HT2A agonism and indicator of the compounds hallucinogenic potential. However, like psilocybin, norbaeocystin was also found to improve outcomes in the forced swim test. All compounds were found to cause minimal changes to metrics of renal and hepatic health, suggesting innocuous safety profiles. Collectively, this work suggests that other naturally-occurring tryptamines, especially norbaeocystin, may share the same therapeutic potential as psilocybin, but without causing hallucinations. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIBaeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin may have similar therapeutic value to psilocybin, but are understudied C_LIO_LICompound stability varied widely, with dephosphorylated forms showing lowest stability C_LIO_LIRates of metabolism by alkaline phosphatase and monoamine oxidase were similar across compounds C_LIO_LIBlood brain barrier penetration was limited to dephosphorylated forms of psilocybin, baeocystin, and norbaeocystin C_LIO_LIRat behavioral testing suggested norbaeocystin may have therapeutic utility similar to psilocybin, without causing hallucinations C_LI\nPharmacological AMP-activated protein kinase activation suppresses low glucose-dependent macrophage migration inhibitory factor release from macrophages\nAuthors: Zhang, J.; Pollard, A. E.; Carling, D.; Benoit, V.; Ellacott, K. L.; Beall, C.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562445\nAims/hypothesisAcute hypoglycemia promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increasing risk for cardiovascular events in diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated by and influences production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We tested the mechanistic role of AMPK in low glucose induced changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is elevated in patients with diabetes. MethodsMacrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells, primary macrophage bone marrow derived macrophages obtained from wild type mice or AMPK {gamma}1 gain-of-function mice were utilized, as were AMPK1/2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Allosteric AMPK activators PF-06409577 and BI-9774 were used, in conjunction with inhibitor SBI-0206965 were also used. We examined changes in protein phosphorylation/expression using western blotting, and protein localisation using immunofluorescence. Metabolic function was assessed using extracellular flux analyses and luciferase-based ATP assay. Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Oxidative stress was detected using a fluorescence-based ROS assay, and cell viability was examined using flow cytometry. ResultsMacrophages exposed to low glucose showed a transient and modest activation of AMPK and a metabolic shift towards increased oxidative phosphorylation. Low glucose induced oxidative stress and increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Pharmacological activation of AMPK by PF-06409577 and BI-9774 attenuated low glucose-induced MIF release, with a similar trend noted with genetic activation using AMPK{gamma}1 gain-of-function (D316A) mice, which produced a mild effect on low glucose-induced MIF release. Inhibition of NFB signalling diminished MIF release and AMPK activation modestly but significantly reduced low glucose-induced nuclear translocation of NFB. AMPK activation did not alter low glucose-induced oxidative stress in macrophages but application of AMPK inhibitor SBI-0206965 enhanced oxidative stress in macrophages and in AMPK knockout MEFs, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism Conclusions/interpretationTaken together, these data indicate that pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses release of MIF from macrophages. This is mediated by reduced activation of NFB signalling in response to low glucose-induced oxidative stress and suggests that pharmacological AMPK activation could be a useful strategy for mitigating hypoglycemia-induced inflammation.

C.; Rana, S.; Shrimp, J. H.; White, A. D.; Hemmings, H. C.; Roth, B. L.; Inglese, J.; Andersen, O. S.; Dahlin, J. L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563088\nSince it was proposed as a potential host-directed antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2, the antiparasitic drug ivermectin has been investigated thoroughly in clinical trials, which have provided insufficient support for its clinical efficacy. To examine the potential for ivermectin to be repurposed as an antiviral agent, we therefore undertook a series of preclinical studies. Consistent with early reports, ivermectin decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in in vitro models at low micromolar concentrations, five-to ten-fold higher than the reported toxic clinical concentration. At similar concentrations, ivermectin also decreased cell viability and increased biomarkers of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic and profiling studies revealed that ivermectin nonspecifically perturbs membrane bilayers at the same concentrations where it decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, resulting in nonspecific modulation of membrane-based targets such as G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. These results suggest that a primary molecular mechanism for the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin may be nonspecific membrane perturbation, indicating that ivermectin is unlikely to be translatable into a safe and effective antiviral agent. These results and experimental workflow provide a useful paradigm for performing preclinical studies on (pandemic-related) drug repurposing candidates.

There is a pressing demand to identify novel drug therapies to combat CRC. In this study, we addressed this need by utilizing the library of CRC pharmacological profiles of anticancer drugs and developed QSAR models for prediction of alternative and promiscuous anti-cancer compounds for CRC treatment. Our QSAR models demonstrated their robustness by achieving high correlation of determination (R2) after 10-fold cross validation. For 12 CRC cell lines, R2 ranges from 0.609-0.827. Highest performance was achieved for SW1417 and GP5d cell lines with R2, 0.827 and 0.786, respectively. Further, we listed the most common descriptors in the drug profiles of the CRC cell lines and we also checked the correlation of the descriptors with the drug activity. The KRFP314 fingerprint was the predominantly occurring descriptor, with the KRFPC314 fingerprint following closely in prevalence within the drug profiles of the CRC cell lines. Beyond predictive modeling, we also successfully validated drug-to-oncogene relationship via in-silico methods and identified FDA-approved drugs which could be used as potential anti-CRC drugs, paving the way for subsequent in vitro or in vivo experiments to validate their efficacy. To provide easy accessibility and utility of our research findings, we have incorporated these models into a free-to-use user-friendly prediction webserver named, \"ColoRecPred\" hosted on project.iith.ac.in/cgntlab/colorecpred. This web-based tool can be used to screen for potential anti-cancer compounds for CRC.\nBisphenol S moderately decreases the expression of syncytiotrophoblast marker genes and induces apoptosis in human trophoblast lineages.\nAuthors: Appiah, E.; Salamah, J.; Cheeran, E.; Lee, B.-K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563141\nBisphenol S (BPS) is currently used in the manufacturing of several household equipment such as water pipes and food containers. Hence, its entrance into the human body is almost inevitable. The presence of BPS in body fluids has been reported. However, its potential toxicity, especially on human placenta development and pregnancy progression, has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the impacts of BPS on self-renewal and differentiation potentials of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) by exposing them to three different BPS concentrations during both self-renewal and differentiation of TSCs into syncytiotrophoblast (ST), extravillous trophoblast (EVT), and trophoblast organoids. Interestingly, BPS treatment did not affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and stemness of the TSCs but it led to induction of apoptosis in each trophoblast lineage. BPS altered the expression of several fusion-related genes. However, this alteration did not translate into significant morphological defects in the STs and organoids. Moreover, BPS did not impair the differentiation of TSCs into EVTs. These findings suggest that the presence of BPS at the feto-maternal interface may exaggerate trophoblast apoptosis and moderately inhibit the trophoblast fusion pathway to affect placenta development and pregnancy. Our study offers valuable insights into the toxicity of BPS on human placenta development, emphasizing the need for further research on the relationship between maternal serum levels of BPS and pregnancy complications.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Despite the high prevalence of cancers driven by KRAS mutations, to date only the G12C mutation has been clinically proven to be druggable via covalent targeting of the mutated cysteine amino acid residue1. However, in many cancer indications other KRAS mutations, such as G12D and -V, are far more prevalent and small molecule concepts that can address a wider variety of oncogenic KRAS alleles are in high clinical demand2. Here we show that a single small molecule can be used to simultaneously and potently degrade 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles, including those not yet tractable by inhibitors. Compared with inhibition, degradation of oncogenic KRAS results in more profound and sustained pathway modulation across a broad range of KRAS mutant cell lines. As a result, KRAS degraders inhibit growth of the majority of cancer cell lines driven by KRAS mutations while sparing models without genetic KRAS aberrations. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological degradation of oncogenic KRAS leads to tumour regression in vivo. Together, these findings unveil a new path towards addressing KRAS driven cancers with small molecule degraders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes substantial mortality and morbidity globally. The venom of African spitting cobras often causes permanent injury via tissue-destructive dermonecrosis at the bite site, which is ineffectively treated by current antivenoms. To address this therapeutic gap, we identified the aetiological venom toxins responsible for causing local dermonecrosis. While cytotoxic three-finger toxins were primarily responsible for causing spitting cobra cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes, their potentiation by phospholipases A2 toxins was essential to cause dermonecrosis in vivo. This evidence of probable toxin synergism suggests that a single toxin-family inhibiting drug could prevent local envenoming. We show that local injection with the repurposed phospholipase A2-inhibiting drug varespladib significantly prevents local tissue damage caused by several spitting cobra venoms in murine models of envenoming. Our findings therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy to more effectively prevent life-changing morbidity caused by snakebite in rural Africa.

Significance StatementSpitting cobra venoms cause extensive local tissue damage surrounding the site of a snakebite. This damage cannot be effectively prevented with current antivenom treatments, and patients are often left with life-changing wounds. In this study we used cellular and mouse experiments to determine which toxins in African spitting cobra venom are responsible for causing tissue damage, revealing that a combination of two different types of toxins are required to cause pathology in vivo. We then showed that the repurposed drug, varespladib, which targets one of these toxin types, effectively prevents skin and muscle damage in mouse models of envenoming. Collectively these findings suggest that varespladib could be an effective new type of therapy for preventing snakebite morbidity in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several viruses hijack various forms of endocytosis in order to infect host cells. Here, we report the discovery of a new molecule with antiviral properties that we named virapinib, which limits viral entry by macropinocytosis. The identification of virapinib derives from a chemical screen using High-Throughput Microscopy, where we identified new chemical entities capable of preventing infection with a pseudotype virus expressing the spike (S) protein from SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent experiments confirmed the capacity of virapinib to inhibit infection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as by additional viruses, such as Monkeypox virus and TBEV. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the compound inhibited macropinocytosis, limiting this entry route for the viruses. Importantly, virapinib has no significant toxicity to host cells. In summary, we present a new molecule that inhibits viral entry via the endocytic route, offering a new alternative to prevent viral infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Demand for more efficacious antidepressants, particularly those with a rapid onset of action, has resulted in a reevaluation of psychedelic drugs for their therapeutic potential. Several tryptamines found in psilocybin-containing  magic mushrooms share chemical similarities with psilocybin, and early work suggests they may also share receptor targets. However, few studies have explored their pharmacological and behavioral effects. To accomplish this, we compared baeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin with psilocybin to determine if they are metabolized by the same enzymes, penetrate the blood brain barrier, serve as ligands for similar centrally located receptors, and modulate behavior in rodents similarly. We first assessed the stability and optimal storage and handling conditions for each compound. In vitro enzyme kinetics assays then found that all compounds shared nearly identical rates of dephosphorylation via alkaline phosphatase and metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Further, we found that only the dephosphorylated products of baeocystin and norbaeocystin could cross a blood brain barrier mimetic to a similar degree as the dephosphorylated form of psilocybin, psilocin. Behaviorally, only psilocybin was found to induce head twitch responses in rats, a marker of 5HT2A agonism and indicator of the compounds hallucinogenic potential. However, like psilocybin, norbaeocystin was also found to improve outcomes in the forced swim test. All compounds were found to cause minimal changes to metrics of renal and hepatic health, suggesting innocuous safety profiles. Collectively, this work suggests that other naturally-occurring tryptamines, especially norbaeocystin, may share the same therapeutic potential as psilocybin, but without causing hallucinations.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIBaeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin may have similar therapeutic value to psilocybin, but are understudied
C_LIO_LICompound stability varied widely, with dephosphorylated forms showing lowest stability
C_LIO_LIRates of metabolism by alkaline phosphatase and monoamine oxidase were similar across compounds
C_LIO_LIBlood brain barrier penetration was limited to dephosphorylated forms of psilocybin, baeocystin, and norbaeocystin
C_LIO_LIRat behavioral testing suggested norbaeocystin may have therapeutic utility similar to psilocybin, without causing hallucinations

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesisAcute hypoglycemia promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increasing risk for cardiovascular events in diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated by and influences production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We tested the mechanistic role of AMPK in low glucose induced changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is elevated in patients with diabetes.

MethodsMacrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells, primary macrophage bone marrow derived macrophages obtained from wild type mice or AMPK {gamma}1 gain-of-function mice were utilized, as were AMPK1/2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Allosteric AMPK activators PF-06409577 and BI-9774 were used, in conjunction with inhibitor SBI-0206965 were also used. We examined changes in protein phosphorylation/expression using western blotting, and protein localisation using immunofluorescence. Metabolic function was assessed using extracellular flux analyses and luciferase-based ATP assay. Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Oxidative stress was detected using a fluorescence-based ROS assay, and cell viability was examined using flow cytometry.

ResultsMacrophages exposed to low glucose showed a transient and modest activation of AMPK and a metabolic shift towards increased oxidative phosphorylation. Low glucose induced oxidative stress and increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Pharmacological activation of AMPK by PF-06409577 and BI-9774 attenuated low glucose-induced MIF release, with a similar trend noted with genetic activation using AMPK{gamma}1 gain-of-function (D316A) mice, which produced a mild effect on low glucose-induced MIF release. Inhibition of NFB signalling diminished MIF release and AMPK activation modestly but significantly reduced low glucose-induced nuclear translocation of NFB. AMPK activation did not alter low glucose-induced oxidative stress in macrophages but application of AMPK inhibitor SBI-0206965 enhanced oxidative stress in macrophages and in AMPK knockout MEFs, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism

Conclusions/interpretationTaken together, these data indicate that pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses release of MIF from macrophages. This is mediated by reduced activation of NFB signalling in response to low glucose-induced oxidative stress and suggests that pharmacological AMPK activation could be a useful strategy for mitigating hypoglycemia-induced inflammation.

        <p class="abstract">Since it was proposed as a potential host-directed antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2, the antiparasitic drug ivermectin has been investigated thoroughly in clinical trials, which have provided insufficient support for its clinical efficacy. To examine the potential for ivermectin to be repurposed as an antiviral agent, we therefore undertook a series of preclinical studies. Consistent with early reports, ivermectin decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in in vitro models at low micromolar concentrations, five-to ten-fold higher than the reported toxic clinical concentration. At similar concentrations, ivermectin also decreased cell viability and increased biomarkers of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic and profiling studies revealed that ivermectin nonspecifically perturbs membrane bilayers at the same concentrations where it decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, resulting in nonspecific modulation of membrane-based targets such as G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. These results suggest that a primary molecular mechanism for the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin may be nonspecific membrane perturbation, indicating that ivermectin is unlikely to be translatable into a safe and effective antiviral agent. These results and experimental workflow provide a useful paradigm for performing preclinical studies on (pandemic-related) drug repurposing candidates.

        <p class="abstract">Colorectal cancer (CRC) has witnessed a concerning increase in incidence and poses a significant therapeutic challenge due to its poor prognosis. There is a pressing demand to identify novel drug therapies to combat CRC. In this study, we addressed this need by utilizing the library of CRC pharmacological profiles of anticancer drugs and developed QSAR models for prediction of alternative and promiscuous anti-cancer compounds for CRC treatment. Our QSAR models demonstrated their robustness by achieving high correlation of determination (R2) after 10-fold cross validation. For 12 CRC cell lines, R2 ranges from 0.609-0.827. Highest performance was achieved for SW1417 and GP5d cell lines with R2, 0.827 and 0.786, respectively. Further, we listed the most common descriptors in the drug profiles of the CRC cell lines and we also checked the correlation of the descriptors with the drug activity. The KRFP314 fingerprint was the predominantly occurring descriptor, with the KRFPC314 fingerprint following closely in prevalence within the drug profiles of the CRC cell lines. Beyond predictive modeling, we also successfully validated drug-to-oncogene relationship via in-silico methods and identified FDA-approved drugs which could be used as potential anti-CRC drugs, paving the way for subsequent in vitro or in vivo experiments to validate their efficacy. To provide easy accessibility and utility of our research findings, we have incorporated these models into a free-to-use user-friendly prediction webserver named, &#34;ColoRecPred&#34; hosted on project.iith.ac.in/cgntlab/colorecpred. This web-based tool can be used to screen for potential anti-cancer compounds for CRC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bisphenol S (BPS) is currently used in the manufacturing of several household equipment such as water pipes and food containers. Hence, its entrance into the human body is almost inevitable. The presence of BPS in body fluids has been reported. However, its potential toxicity, especially on human placenta development and pregnancy progression, has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the impacts of BPS on self-renewal and differentiation potentials of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) by exposing them to three different BPS concentrations during both self-renewal and differentiation of TSCs into syncytiotrophoblast (ST), extravillous trophoblast (EVT), and trophoblast organoids. Interestingly, BPS treatment did not affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and stemness of the TSCs but it led to induction of apoptosis in each trophoblast lineage. BPS altered the expression of several fusion-related genes. However, this alteration did not translate into significant morphological defects in the STs and organoids. Moreover, BPS did not impair the differentiation of TSCs into EVTs. These findings suggest that the presence of BPS at the feto-maternal interface may exaggerate trophoblast apoptosis and moderately inhibit the trophoblast fusion pathway to affect placenta development and pregnancy. Our study offers valuable insights into the toxicity of BPS on human placenta development, emphasizing the need for further research on the relationship between maternal serum levels of BPS and pregnancy complications.</p>
