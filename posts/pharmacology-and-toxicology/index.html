S.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 34.3, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559713\nPlastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.

G.; Herbert, G.; Bhaskar, K.; McCormick, M.; Brigman, J.; Ottens, A.; Bleske, B.; Campen, M.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558863\nWildland fires have become progressively more extensive over the past 30 years in the US, and now routinely generate smoke that deteriorates air quality for most of the country. We explored the neurometabolomic impact that smoke derived from biomass has on older (18 months) female C57BL/6J mice, both acutely and after 10 weeks of recovery from exposures. Mice (N=6/group) were exposed to wood smoke (WS) 4 hours/day, every other day, for 2 weeks (7 exposures total) to an average concentration of 0.448mg/m3 per exposure. One group was euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure. Other groups were then placed on 1 of 4 treatment regimens for 10 weeks after wood smoke exposures: vehicle; resveratrol in chow plus nicotinamide mononucleotide in water (RNMN); senolytics via gavage (dasatanib+quercetin; DQ); or both RNMN with DQ (RNDQ). Among the findings, the aging from 18 months to 21 months was associated with the greatest metabolic shift, including changes in nicotinamide metabolism, with WS exposure effects that were relatively modest. WS caused a reduction in NAD+ within the prefrontal cortex immediately after exposure and a long-term reduction in serotonin that persisted for 10 weeks. The serotonin reductions were corroborated by forced swim tests, which revealed an increased immobility (reduction in motivation) immediately post-exposure and persisted for 10 weeks. RNMN had the most beneficial effects after WS exposure, while RNDQ caused markers of brain aging to be upregulated within WS-exposed mice. Findings highlight the persistent neurometabolomic and behavioral effects of woodsmoke exposure in an aged mouse model. Significance StatementNeurological impacts of wildfire smoke are largely underexplored but include neuroinflammation and metabolic changes. The present study highlights modulation of major metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and behavioral consequences in aged (18 month) female mice that persists 10 weeks after wood smoke exposure ended. Supplements derived from the anti-aging field were able to mitigate much of the woodsmoke effect, especially a combination of resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide.\nKetone supplementation dampens subjective and objective responses to alcohol in rats and humans\nAuthors: Li, X.; Shi, Z.; Todaro, D.; Pond, T.; Byanyima, J.; Vesslee, S.; Reddy, R.; Nanga, R. N. P. R.; Kass, G.; Ramchandani, V.; Kranzler, H.; Vendruscolo, J.; Vendruscolo, L.; Wiers, C. E.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.23.558269\nPrevious preclinical and human studies have shown that high-fat ketogenic diet and ketone supplements (KS) are efficacious in reducing alcohol craving, alcohol consumption, and signs of alcohol withdrawal. However, the effects of KS on alcohol sensitivity are unknown. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 10 healthy participants (3 females) were administered a single, oral dose of a KS (25 g of ketones from D-{beta}-hydroxybutyric acid and R-1,3-butanediol) or placebo 30 min prior to an oral alcohol dose (0.25 g/kg for women; 0.31 g/kg for men). Assessments of breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) and blood alcohol levels (BAL) and responses on the Drug Effect Questionnaire were repeatedly obtained over 180 min after alcohol consumption. In a parallel preclinical study, 8 Wistar rats (4 females) received an oral gavage of KS (0.42 g ketones/kg), water, or the sweetener allulose (0.58 g/kg) followed 15 min later by an oral alcohol dose (0.8 g/kg). BAL were monitored for 240 min after alcohol exposure. In humans, the intake of KS prior to alcohol significantly blunted BrAC and BAL, reduced ratings of alcohol liking and wanting, and increased disliking for alcohol. In rats, KS reduced BAL more than either allulose or water. In conclusion, KS altered physiological and subjective responses to alcohol in both humans and rats and the effects were likely not mediated by the sweetener allulose present in the KS drink. Therefore, KS could potentially reduce the intoxicating and rewarding effects of alcohol and thus be a novel intervention for treating alcohol use disorder.\nBeyond the nucleus: Plastic chemicals activate G protein-coupled receptors\nAuthors: McPartland, M.; Stevens, S.; Bartosova, Z.; Gisnaas Vardeberg, I.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560665\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central mediators of cell signaling and physiological function. Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.\nCurcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion\nAuthors: Septisetyani, E.

F.; Santoso, A.; Eriani, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560070\nTurmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TEs impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 {micro}M and 10 {micro}M for curcumin and 1 {micro}g/ml and 10 {micro}g/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models.

M.; Grant, Y.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556932\nThe use of Electronic Drug Delivery Systems (EDDS, \"e-cigarettes\") to ingest nicotine and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has surged in adolescent populations in the United States, as five times as many high-school seniors vape nicotine daily as use tobacco. At the same time 19.5% of seniors use cannabis at least monthly, with 12% using EDDS to deliver it. This study was conducted to examine the impact of repeated adolescent vapor inhalation of nicotine and THC in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30-minute sessions of vapor inhalation, twice daily, from Post-Natal Day (PND) 31 to PND 40. Conditions included vapor from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, Nicotine (60 mg/mL in the PG), THC (100 mg/mL in the PG) or the combination of Nicotine (60 mg/mL) and THC (100 mg/mL). Rats were assessed on wheel activity, heroin anti-nociception and nicotine and heroin vapor volitional exposure during adulthood. Nicotine exposed rats exhibited few differences as adults, but were less sensitive to anti-nociceptive effects of heroin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). THC- and THC+Nicotine-exposed rats were less spontaneously active, and obtained fewer nicotine vapor deliveries as adults. In contrast, THC exposed rats obtained volitional heroin vapor at rates indistinguishable from the non-THC-exposed groups. Repeated THC exposure also caused tolerance to temperature-disrupting effects of THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.). These studies further confirm that the effects of repeated vapor exposure to THC in adolescence last into early to middle adulthood, including decreased volitional consumption of nicotine. Effects of repeated nicotine in adolescence were comparatively minor.\nThe effect of common paralytic agents used for fluorescence imaging on redox tone and ATP levels in Caenorhabditis elegans\nAuthors: Morton, K.; Wahl, A.; Meyer, J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558750\nOne aspect of Caenorhabditis elegans that makes it a highly valuable model organism is the ease of use of in vivo genetic reporters, facilitated by its transparent cuticle and highly tractable genetics. Despite the rapid advancement of these technologies, worms must be paralyzed for most imaging applications, and few investigations have characterized the impacts of common chemical anesthetic methods on the parameters measured, in particular biochemical measurements such as cellular energetics and redox tone. Using two dynamic reporters, QUEEN-2m for relative ATP levels and reduction-oxidation sensitive GFP (roGFP) for redox tone, we assess the impact of commonly used chemical paralytics. We report that no chemical anesthetic is entirely effective at doses required for full paralysis without altering redox tone or ATP levels, though 100 mM 2,3-Butadione monoxime appears to be the least problematic. We also assess the use of cold shock, commonly used in combination with physical restraint methods, and find that cold shock does not alter either ATP levels or redox tone. In addition to informing which paralytics are most appropriate for research in these topics, we highlight the need for tailoring the use of anesthetics to different endpoints and experimental questions. Further, we reinforce the need for developing less disruptive paralytic methods for optimal imaging of dynamic in vivo reporters.\nDiscovery of a new activator of Slack potassium channels with robust efficacy in models of histamine-independent and chronic itch\nAuthors: Balzulat, A.; Zhu, W. F.; Flauaus, C.; Hernandez-Olmos, V.; Heering, J.; Sethumadhavan, S.; Dubiel, M.; Frank, A.; Menge, A.; Hebchen, M.; Metzner, K.; Lu, R.; Lukowski, R.; Ruth, P.; Knapp, S.; Mueller, S.; Steinhilber, D.; Haenelt, I.; Stark, H.; Proschak, E.; Schmidtko, A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560997\nVarious disorders are accompanied by histamine-independent itching, which is often resistant to the currently available therapies. In this study, we hypothesized that pharmacological activation of Slack (Kcnt1, KNa1.1), a potassium channel highly expressed in itch-sensitive sensory neurons, has therapeutic potential for the treatment of itching. Based on the Slack-activating antipsychotic drug, loxapine, we designed a series of new derivatives with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles that enabled us to validate Slack as a pharmacological target in vivo. One of these new Slack activators, compound 6, exhibited negligible dopamine D2 and D3 receptor binding, unlike loxapine. We found that compound 6 displayed potent on-target antipruritic activity in multiple mouse models of acute histamine-independent and chronic itch without motor side effects. These properties make compound 6 a lead molecule for the development of new antipruritic therapies targeting Slack.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Plastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.

        <p class="abstract">Wildland fires have become progressively more extensive over the past 30 years in the US, and now routinely generate smoke that deteriorates air quality for most of the country. We explored the neurometabolomic impact that smoke derived from biomass has on older (18 months) female C57BL/6J mice, both acutely and after 10 weeks of recovery from exposures. Mice (N=6/group) were exposed to wood smoke (WS) 4 hours/day, every other day, for 2 weeks (7 exposures total) to an average concentration of 0.448mg/m3 per exposure. One group was euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure. Other groups were then placed on 1 of 4 treatment regimens for 10 weeks after wood smoke exposures: vehicle; resveratrol in chow plus nicotinamide mononucleotide in water (RNMN); senolytics via gavage (dasatanib&#43;quercetin; DQ); or both RNMN with DQ (RNDQ). Among the findings, the aging from 18 months to 21 months was associated with the greatest metabolic shift, including changes in nicotinamide metabolism, with WS exposure effects that were relatively modest. WS caused a reduction in NAD&#43; within the prefrontal cortex immediately after exposure and a long-term reduction in serotonin that persisted for 10 weeks. The serotonin reductions were corroborated by forced swim tests, which revealed an increased immobility (reduction in motivation) immediately post-exposure and persisted for 10 weeks. RNMN had the most beneficial effects after WS exposure, while RNDQ caused markers of brain aging to be upregulated within WS-exposed mice. Findings highlight the persistent neurometabolomic and behavioral effects of woodsmoke exposure in an aged mouse model.

Significance StatementNeurological impacts of wildfire smoke are largely underexplored but include neuroinflammation and metabolic changes. The present study highlights modulation of major metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and behavioral consequences in aged (18 month) female mice that persists 10 weeks after wood smoke exposure ended. Supplements derived from the anti-aging field were able to mitigate much of the woodsmoke effect, especially a combination of resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previous preclinical and human studies have shown that high-fat ketogenic diet and ketone supplements (KS) are efficacious in reducing alcohol craving, alcohol consumption, and signs of alcohol withdrawal. However, the effects of KS on alcohol sensitivity are unknown. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 10 healthy participants (3 females) were administered a single, oral dose of a KS (25 g of ketones from D-{beta}-hydroxybutyric acid and R-1,3-butanediol) or placebo 30 min prior to an oral alcohol dose (0.25 g/kg for women; 0.31 g/kg for men). Assessments of breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) and blood alcohol levels (BAL) and responses on the Drug Effect Questionnaire were repeatedly obtained over 180 min after alcohol consumption. In a parallel preclinical study, 8 Wistar rats (4 females) received an oral gavage of KS (0.42 g ketones/kg), water, or the sweetener allulose (0.58 g/kg) followed 15 min later by an oral alcohol dose (0.8 g/kg). BAL were monitored for 240 min after alcohol exposure. In humans, the intake of KS prior to alcohol significantly blunted BrAC and BAL, reduced ratings of alcohol liking and wanting, and increased disliking for alcohol. In rats, KS reduced BAL more than either allulose or water. In conclusion, KS altered physiological and subjective responses to alcohol in both humans and rats and the effects were likely not mediated by the sweetener allulose present in the KS drink. Therefore, KS could potentially reduce the intoxicating and rewarding effects of alcohol and thus be a novel intervention for treating alcohol use disorder.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central mediators of cell signaling and physiological function. Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Turmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TEs impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 {micro}M and 10 {micro}M for curcumin and 1 {micro}g/ml and 10 {micro}g/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models.

        <p class="abstract">The use of Electronic Drug Delivery Systems (EDDS, &#34;e-cigarettes&#34;) to ingest nicotine and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has surged in adolescent populations in the United States, as five times as many high-school seniors vape nicotine daily as use tobacco. At the same time 19.5% of seniors use cannabis at least monthly, with 12% using EDDS to deliver it. This study was conducted to examine the impact of repeated adolescent vapor inhalation of nicotine and THC in rats.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30-minute sessions of vapor inhalation, twice daily, from Post-Natal Day (PND) 31 to PND 40. Conditions included vapor from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, Nicotine (60 mg/mL in the PG), THC (100 mg/mL in the PG) or the combination of Nicotine (60 mg/mL) and THC (100 mg/mL). Rats were assessed on wheel activity, heroin anti-nociception and nicotine and heroin vapor volitional exposure during adulthood.

Nicotine exposed rats exhibited few differences as adults, but were less sensitive to anti-nociceptive effects of heroin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). THC- and THC&#43;Nicotine-exposed rats were less spontaneously active, and obtained fewer nicotine vapor deliveries as adults. In contrast, THC exposed rats obtained volitional heroin vapor at rates indistinguishable from the non-THC-exposed groups. Repeated THC exposure also caused tolerance to temperature-disrupting effects of THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.).

These studies further confirm that the effects of repeated vapor exposure to THC in adolescence last into early to middle adulthood, including decreased volitional consumption of nicotine. Effects of repeated nicotine in adolescence were comparatively minor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One aspect of Caenorhabditis elegans that makes it a highly valuable model organism is the ease of use of in vivo genetic reporters, facilitated by its transparent cuticle and highly tractable genetics. Despite the rapid advancement of these technologies, worms must be paralyzed for most imaging applications, and few investigations have characterized the impacts of common chemical anesthetic methods on the parameters measured, in particular biochemical measurements such as cellular energetics and redox tone. Using two dynamic reporters, QUEEN-2m for relative ATP levels and reduction-oxidation sensitive GFP (roGFP) for redox tone, we assess the impact of commonly used chemical paralytics. We report that no chemical anesthetic is entirely effective at doses required for full paralysis without altering redox tone or ATP levels, though 100 mM 2,3-Butadione monoxime appears to be the least problematic. We also assess the use of cold shock, commonly used in combination with physical restraint methods, and find that cold shock does not alter either ATP levels or redox tone. In addition to informing which paralytics are most appropriate for research in these topics, we highlight the need for tailoring the use of anesthetics to different endpoints and experimental questions. Further, we reinforce the need for developing less disruptive paralytic methods for optimal imaging of dynamic in vivo reporters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Various disorders are accompanied by histamine-independent itching, which is often resistant to the currently available therapies. In this study, we hypothesized that pharmacological activation of Slack (Kcnt1, KNa1.1), a potassium channel highly expressed in itch-sensitive sensory neurons, has therapeutic potential for the treatment of itching. Based on the Slack-activating antipsychotic drug, loxapine, we designed a series of new derivatives with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles that enabled us to validate Slack as a pharmacological target in vivo. One of these new Slack activators, compound 6, exhibited negligible dopamine D2 and D3 receptor binding, unlike loxapine. We found that compound 6 displayed potent on-target antipruritic activity in multiple mouse models of acute histamine-independent and chronic itch without motor side effects. These properties make compound 6 a lead molecule for the development of new antipruritic therapies targeting Slack.</p>
