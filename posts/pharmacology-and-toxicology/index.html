Here we demonstrate that isolated corpora cavernosa (CC) from human donors with low vitamin D levels show reduced NO-dependent erectile function. This ED is also reproduced in vitamin D deficient rats and vitamin D receptor knockout mice in vivo and ex vivo and is associated with penile fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency also blunts the response of CC to the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil. CC from deficient rats show increased superoxide and their impaired erectile function is restored by superoxide scavengers. These results suggest that vitamin D deficiency induces ED via increased superoxide production.\nIlluminating the Function of the Orphan Transporter, SLC22A10 in Humans and Other Primates\nAuthors: Yee, S.

M.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552553\nSLC22A10 is classified as an orphan transporter with unknown substrates and function. Here we describe the discovery of the substrate specificity and functional characteristics of SLC22A10. The human SLC22A10 tagged with green fluorescent protein was found to be absent from the plasma membrane, in contrast to the SLC22A10 orthologs found in great apes. Estradiol-17{beta}-glucuronide accumulated in cells expressing great ape SLC22A10 orthologs (over 4-fold, p\u003c0.001). In contrast, human SLC22A10 displayed no uptake function. Sequence alignments revealed two amino acid differences including a proline at position 220 of the human SLC22A10 and a leucine at the same position of great ape orthologs. Site-directed mutagenesis yielding the human SLC22A10-P220L produced a protein with excellent plasma membrane localization and associated uptake function. Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes show human-like sequences at proline 220 position, corroborating that SLC22A10 were rendered nonfunctional during hominin evolution after the divergence from the pan lineage (chimpanzees and bonobos). These findings demonstrate that human SLC22A10 is a unitary pseudogene and was inactivated by a missense mutation that is fixed in humans, whereas orthologs in great apes transport sex steroid conjugates.\nIlluminating the Function of the Orphan Transporter, SLC22A10 in Humans and Other Primates\nAuthors: Yee, S.

B.; Wong, T. J.; Visniauskas, B.; Blessinger, S. A.; Imulinde Sugi, A.; Richard, C.; Diaz, Z.; Horton, A.; Natale, C. A.; Ogola, B. O.; Lindsey, S. H.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552881\nObjective: Arterial stiffness is a cardiovascular risk factor and dramatically increases as women transition through menopause. The current study assessed whether a mouse model of menopause increases arterial stiffness in a similar manner to aging, and whether activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) could reverse stiffness. Approach and Results: Female C57Bl/6J mice were ovariectomized (OVX) at 10 weeks of age or aged to 52 weeks, and some mice were treated with GPER agonists. OVX and aging increased pulse wave velocity to a similar extent independent of changes in blood pressure. Aging increased carotid wall thickness, while OVX increased material stiffness without altering vascular geometry. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that OVX downregulated smooth muscle contractile genes. The enantiomerically pure GPER agonist, LNS8801, reversed stiffness in OVX mice to a greater degree than the racemic agonist G-1. Conclusion: In summary, OVX and aging induced arterial stiffening via potentially different mechanisms. Aging was associated with inward remodeling while OVX induced material stiffness independent of geometry and a loss of the contractile phenotype. This study helps to further our understanding of the impact of menopause on vascular health and identifies LNS8801 as a potential therapy to counteract this detrimental process in women.\nChemical and biophysical characterization of novel potassium channel blocker 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine\nAuthors: Sun, Y.; Rodriguez-Rangel, S.; Zhang, L. L.; Sanchez-Rodriguez, J. E.; Brugarolas, P.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.550404\n4-aminopyridine (4AP) is a potassium (K+) channel blocker used clinically to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). 4AP binds to exposed K+ channels in demyelinated axons, reducing the leakage of intracellular K+ and enhancing impulse conduction. Multiple derivatives of 4AP capable of blocking K+ channels have been reported including three radiolabeled with positron emitting isotopes for imaging demyelinated lesions using positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we describe 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine (5Me3F4AP), a novel K+ channel blocker with potential application in PET. 5Me3F4AP has comparable potency to 4AP and the PET tracer 3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine (3F4AP). Compared to 3F4AP, 5Me3F4AP is more lipophilic (logD = 0.664 {+/-} 0.005 vs. 0.414 {+/-} 0.002) and slightly more basic (pKa = 7.46 {+/-} 0.01 vs. 7.37 {+/-} 0.07). In addition, 5Me3F4AP appears to be more permeable to an artificial brain membrane and more stable towards oxidation by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1), responsible for the metabolism of 4AP and 3F4AP. Taken together, 5Me3F4AP has promising properties for PET imaging warranting additional investigation. Significance StatementThe PET tracer [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) binds to K+ channels in demyelinated axons and has shown promise for imaging demyelinated lesions in animal models. However, its use in humans may be compromised due to rapid metabolism. Thus, a novel 3F4AP derivative amenable to labeling with fluorine-18 was designed and evaluated in vitro. The results indicate that 5-methyl-3F4AP exhibits high binding affinity, good physicochemical properties and slower oxidation by CYP2E1 than 3F4AP, making it a promising candidate for further PET studies.\nMicrocystin-RR is a biliary toxin selective for neonatal cholangiocytes\nAuthors: Gupta, K.; Chen, D.; Wells, R. G.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552661\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biliary atresia is a fibrosing cholangiopathy affecting neonates that is thought to be caused by a prenatal environmental insult to the bile duct. Biliatresone, a plant toxin with an -methylene ketone group, was previously implicated in toxin-induced biliary atresia in Australian livestock, but is found in a limited location and is highly unlikely to be a significant human toxin. We hypothesized that other molecules with -methylene ketone groups, some with the potential for significant human exposure, might also be biliary toxins. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We focused on the family of microcystins, cyclic peptide toxins from blue-green algae that have an -methylene ketone group and are found worldwide, particularly during harmful algal blooms. We found that microcystin-RR, but not 6 other microcystins, caused damage to cell spheroids made using cholangiocytes isolated from 2-3-day-old mice, but not from adult mice. We also found that microcystin-RR caused occlusion of extrahepatic bile duct explants from 2-day-old mice, but not 18-day-old mice. Microcystin-RR caused elevated reactive oxygen species in neonatal cholangiocytes, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine partially prevented microcystin-RR-induced lumen closure, suggesting a role for redox homeostasis in its mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for environmental toxins to cause neonatal biliary disease and identifies microcystin-RR acting via increased redox stress as a possible neonatal bile duct toxin.\nPharmacology of Berberine and its Metabolites, is it the natures Ozempic or Imatinib?\nAuthors: Singh, N. K.; Dhanasekaran, M.; Kumar, A. H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552100\nBackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools. Materials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool. ResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of \u003c4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were \u003e 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (\u003c1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values \u003c 5 uM. ConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.\nRNA splicing modulator induces peripheral neuropathy with increased neurofilament light chain levels via p53 signaling\nAuthors: Krach, F.; Boerstler, T.; Reischl, S.; Krumm, L.; Regensburger, M.; Winkler, J.; Winner, B.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551640\nRNA splicing modulators are a new class of small molecules with the potential to modify the expression levels of proteins. A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

R.; Perez Sabino, J. F.; Mendoza Elvira, S.; Ribeiro da Silva, A. J.; Ulloa Rojas, J. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.549066\nObjetiveThis study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of essential oil (EO) from diverse chemotypes of Lippia graveolens against oxytetracycline-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila, which primarily affects the tilapia aquaculture (Oreochromis sp) in Guatemala. MethodologyL. graveolens were collected in three departments in Guatemala, the EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Subsequently, an antimicrobial assay was conducted by screening the disk and dilution susceptibility tests, and evaluation of synergistic interactions among the chemotypes, each test being carried out in triplicate. ResultsThe analysis revealed the presence of twenty-seven compounds in the EO obtained from the chemotypes, the main class being monoterpene. The major constituents identified were cis-Dihydro-{beta}-terpineol (8.84%) in chemotype I, carvacrol (51.82%) in chemotype II, and thymol (79.62%) in chemotype III. All EO chemotypes of L. graveolens demonstrated the ability to inhibit the A. hydrophila growth. Thymol chemotype exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against bacterial growth, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 92.4 {micro}g/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 184.8 {micro}g/mL. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is no synergistic or additive effect when combining different chemotypes of L. graveolens. ConclusionsThis the first report of L. graveolens chemotypes exhibiting antimicrobial activity against oxytetracycline-resistant A. hydrophila. The findings suggest the chemotype thymol could be a potential treatment for infections in the tilapia aquaculture in Guatemala.\nMachine learning models for prediction of xenobiotic chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk\nAuthors: Vijayaraghavan, S.; Lakshminarayanan, A.; Bhargava, N.; Ravichandran, J.; Vivek-Ananth, R. P.; Samal, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552173\nBreast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological studies suggest a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and erectile dysfunction (ED) but its causal relationship and the mechanism involved are unclear. Here we demonstrate that isolated corpora cavernosa (CC) from human donors with low vitamin D levels show reduced NO-dependent erectile function. This ED is also reproduced in vitamin D deficient rats and vitamin D receptor knockout mice in vivo and ex vivo and is associated with penile fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency also blunts the response of CC to the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil. CC from deficient rats show increased superoxide and their impaired erectile function is restored by superoxide scavengers. These results suggest that vitamin D deficiency induces ED via increased superoxide production.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Arterial stiffness is a cardiovascular risk factor and dramatically increases as women transition through menopause. The current study assessed whether a mouse model of menopause increases arterial stiffness in a similar manner to aging, and whether activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) could reverse stiffness. Approach and Results: Female C57Bl/6J mice were ovariectomized (OVX) at 10 weeks of age or aged to 52 weeks, and some mice were treated with GPER agonists. OVX and aging increased pulse wave velocity to a similar extent independent of changes in blood pressure. Aging increased carotid wall thickness, while OVX increased material stiffness without altering vascular geometry. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that OVX downregulated smooth muscle contractile genes. The enantiomerically pure GPER agonist, LNS8801, reversed stiffness in OVX mice to a greater degree than the racemic agonist G-1. Conclusion: In summary, OVX and aging induced arterial stiffening via potentially different mechanisms. Aging was associated with inward remodeling while OVX induced material stiffness independent of geometry and a loss of the contractile phenotype. This study helps to further our understanding of the impact of menopause on vascular health and identifies LNS8801 as a potential therapy to counteract this detrimental process in women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">4-aminopyridine (4AP) is a potassium (K&#43;) channel blocker used clinically to improve walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). 4AP binds to exposed K&#43; channels in demyelinated axons, reducing the leakage of intracellular K&#43; and enhancing impulse conduction. Multiple derivatives of 4AP capable of blocking K&#43; channels have been reported including three radiolabeled with positron emitting isotopes for imaging demyelinated lesions using positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we describe 3-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-4-amine (5Me3F4AP), a novel K&#43; channel blocker with potential application in PET. 5Me3F4AP has comparable potency to 4AP and the PET tracer 3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine (3F4AP). Compared to 3F4AP, 5Me3F4AP is more lipophilic (logD = 0.664 {&#43;/-} 0.005 vs. 0.414 {&#43;/-} 0.002) and slightly more basic (pKa = 7.46 {&#43;/-} 0.01 vs. 7.37 {&#43;/-} 0.07). In addition, 5Me3F4AP appears to be more permeable to an artificial brain membrane and more stable towards oxidation by the cytochrome P450 enzyme family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1), responsible for the metabolism of 4AP and 3F4AP. Taken together, 5Me3F4AP has promising properties for PET imaging warranting additional investigation.

Significance StatementThe PET tracer [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) binds to K&#43; channels in demyelinated axons and has shown promise for imaging demyelinated lesions in animal models. However, its use in humans may be compromised due to rapid metabolism. Thus, a novel 3F4AP derivative amenable to labeling with fluorine-18 was designed and evaluated in vitro. The results indicate that 5-methyl-3F4AP exhibits high binding affinity, good physicochemical properties and slower oxidation by CYP2E1 than 3F4AP, making it a promising candidate for further PET studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Biliary atresia is a fibrosing cholangiopathy affecting neonates that is thought to be caused by a prenatal environmental insult to the bile duct. Biliatresone, a plant toxin with an -methylene ketone group, was previously implicated in toxin-induced biliary atresia in Australian livestock, but is found in a limited location and is highly unlikely to be a significant human toxin. We hypothesized that other molecules with -methylene ketone groups, some with the potential for significant human exposure, might also be biliary toxins. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We focused on the family of microcystins, cyclic peptide toxins from blue-green algae that have an -methylene ketone group and are found worldwide, particularly during harmful algal blooms. We found that microcystin-RR, but not 6 other microcystins, caused damage to cell spheroids made using cholangiocytes isolated from 2-3-day-old mice, but not from adult mice. We also found that microcystin-RR caused occlusion of extrahepatic bile duct explants from 2-day-old mice, but not 18-day-old mice. Microcystin-RR caused elevated reactive oxygen species in neonatal cholangiocytes, and treatment with N-acetyl cysteine partially prevented microcystin-RR-induced lumen closure, suggesting a role for redox homeostasis in its mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential for environmental toxins to cause neonatal biliary disease and identifies microcystin-RR acting via increased redox stress as a possible neonatal bile duct toxin.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools.

Materials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool.

ResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of &lt;4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were &gt; 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (&lt;1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values &lt; 5 uM.

ConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RNA splicing modulators are a new class of small molecules with the potential to modify the expression levels of proteins. A recent clinical trial investigating the splicing modulator branaplam for Huntingtons disease to lower huntingtin levels was terminated due to the development of peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe how branaplam leads to this adverse effect. On a cellular level, branaplam disrupts neurite integrity reflected by elevated neurofilament light chain levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons (iPSC-MN). Branaplam does not target neuropathy-associated genes. However, transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis indicates p53 activation. P53 activation upon branaplam treatment in iPSC-MN is linked to increased nucleolar stress, thereby enhanced expression of the neurotoxic p53-target gene BBC3. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing modulators may have clinically relevant off-target effects, implying the necessity of comprehensive pre-screening in human models prior to executing clinical trials.

        <p class="abstract">ObjetiveThis study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of essential oil (EO) from diverse chemotypes of Lippia graveolens against oxytetracycline-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila, which primarily affects the tilapia aquaculture (Oreochromis sp) in Guatemala.

MethodologyL. graveolens were collected in three departments in Guatemala, the EO was obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Subsequently, an antimicrobial assay was conducted by screening the disk and dilution susceptibility tests, and evaluation of synergistic interactions among the chemotypes, each test being carried out in triplicate.

ResultsThe analysis revealed the presence of twenty-seven compounds in the EO obtained from the chemotypes, the main class being monoterpene. The major constituents identified were cis-Dihydro-{beta}-terpineol (8.84%) in chemotype I, carvacrol (51.82%) in chemotype II, and thymol (79.62%) in chemotype III. All EO chemotypes of L. graveolens demonstrated the ability to inhibit the A. hydrophila growth. Thymol chemotype exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect against bacterial growth, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 92.4 {micro}g/mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 184.8 {micro}g/mL. Furthermore, the results suggest that there is no synergistic or additive effect when combining different chemotypes of L. graveolens.

ConclusionsThis the first report of L. graveolens chemotypes exhibiting antimicrobial activity against oxytetracycline-resistant A. hydrophila. The findings suggest the chemotype thymol could be a potential treatment for infections in the tilapia aquaculture in Guatemala.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Breast milk serves as a vital source of essential nutrients for infants. However, human milk contamination via transfer of environmental chemicals from maternal exposome is a significant concern for infant health. Machine learning based predictive toxicology models can be valuable in predicting chemicals with high propensity to transfer into human milk. To this end, we build such classification- and regression-based models by employing multiple machine learning algorithms and leveraging the largest curated dataset to date of 375 chemicals with known Milk to Plasma concentration (M/P) ratios. Our Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier outperforms other models in terms of different performance metrics, when evaluated on both (internal) test data and external test dataset. Specifically, the SVM based classifier on (internal) test data achieved a classification accuracy of 77.33%, specificity of 84%, sensitivity of 64%, and F-score of 65.31%. When evaluated on an external test dataset, our SVM based classifier is found to be generalizable with sensitivity of 77.78%. While we were able to build highly predictive classification models, our best regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of chemicals could achieve only moderate R2 values on the (internal) test data. As noted in earlier literature, our study also highlights the challenges in developing accurate regression models for predicting the M/P ratio of xenobiotic chemicals. We have made our complete workflow, train and test datasets, and computer codes for the classification and regression models publicly available via a dedicated GitHub repository. Overall, this study attests the immense potential of predictive computational toxicology models in characterizing the myriad chemicals in the human exposome.</p>
