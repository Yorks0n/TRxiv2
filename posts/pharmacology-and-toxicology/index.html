However, all drugs have undesirable side effects, which likely result from the drug binding to other protein targets. Drug promiscuity refers to the ability of small molecule compounds to bind with high affinity to multiple proteins. This drug property is responsible for the problems caused by their side effects. But drug promiscuity also presents a promise: if a drug targets numerous proteins, each interaction may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. The ability to target multiple genes is especially promising for medicines that treat systemic diseases, including neurological disorders and cancers, which result from gene network problems. Here, I will review both aspects of drug promiscuity and illustrate a potential strategy to move this forward using a computer modeling approach.\nCharacterization of DSPE-mPEG raw materials from different vendors reveals differences in impurity profiles and polymer chain length polydispersity\nAuthors: Hackbusch, S.; White, S.; Du, M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574088\nPEGylated lipids such as 1,2-distearoyl-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methoxy-polyethyleneglycol-2000 (DSPE-mPEG) are essential components of lipid nanoparticle formulations. They have an impact on the efficacy and quality of the drug products they used in, and as such should be carefully characterized. The present work used liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detection and high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the polydispersity and purity of several lots of DSPE-mPEG, revealing significant differences in the level and identity of impurities. Additionally, mass spectral data showed that there were variations in the polyethylene glycol chain length between lots of comparable purity, which could not be detected by charged aerosol detection alone. The obtained results may be of importance in the development of new lipid nanoparticle based drugs.

Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.\nAlphaFold2 structures template ligand discovery\nAuthors: Lyu, J.; Kapolka, N.; Gumpper, R.; Alon, A.; Wang, L.; Jain, M.; Alvarez, X.; Sakamoto, K.; Kim, Y.; DiBerto, J.; Kim, K.; Tummino, T.; Huang, S.; Irwin, J.; Tarkhanova, O.; Moroz, Y.; Skiniotis, G.; Kruse, A.; Shoichet, B.; Roth, B.\nScore: 53.7, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572662\nAlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold have greatly expanded the number of structures available for structure-based ligand discovery, even though retrospective studies have cast doubt on their direct usefulness for that goal. Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.\nDevelopmental Reprogramming of Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis in Mice by Common Environmental Pollutants\nAuthors: Mogus, J. P.; Marin, M.; Arowolo, O.; Salemme, V. R.; Suvorov, A.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574224\nHumans are exposed to a large number of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Many studies demonstrated that exposures to EDCs during critical windows of development can permanently affect endocrine health outcomes. Most of experimental studies address changes in secretion of hormones produced by gonads, thyroid gland and adrenals, and little is known about the ability of EDCs to produce long-term changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) control axes. Here, we examined the long-term effects of three common EDCs on male mouse HP gene expression, following developmental exposures. Pregnant mice were exposed to 0.2 mg/ml solutions of bisphenol S (BPS), 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), or 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) from pregnancy day 8 through lactation day 21 (weaning day). Male offspring were left untreated until postnatal day 140, where pituitaries and hypothalami were collected. Pituitaries were assed for gene expression via RNA sequencing, while specific genes were assessed for expression in hypothalami via RT-qPCR. Differential expression, as well as gene enrichment and pathway analysis, indicated that all three chemicals induced long-term changes, (mostly suppression) in pituitary genes involved in its endocrine function. BPS and BDE-47 produced effects overlapping significantly at the level of effected genes and pathways. All three chemicals altered genes and pathways of gonad and liver HP axes, while BPS altered HP-adrenal and BDE-47 altered HP-thyroid pathways specifically. All three chemicals also reduced expression of immune genes in the pituitaries. Targeted gene expression in the hypothalamus indicates a down regulation of hypothalamic endocrine control genes by BPS and BDE-47 groups, concordant with changes in the pituitary and suggests that these chemicals suppress the overall HP endocrine function. Interestingly, all three chemicals altered pituitary genes of GPCR-mediated intracellular signaling molecules, many of which are key signalers common to many pituitary responses to hormones. The results of this study show that developmental exposures to common and ubiquitous EDCs have long-term impacts on hormonal feedback control at the hypothalamic-pituitary level.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold have greatly expanded the number of structures available for structure-based ligand discovery, even though retrospective studies have cast doubt on their direct usefulness for that goal. Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Humans are exposed to a large number of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Many studies demonstrated that exposures to EDCs during critical windows of development can permanently affect endocrine health outcomes. Most of experimental studies address changes in secretion of hormones produced by gonads, thyroid gland and adrenals, and little is known about the ability of EDCs to produce long-term changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) control axes. Here, we examined the long-term effects of three common EDCs on male mouse HP gene expression, following developmental exposures. Pregnant mice were exposed to 0.2 mg/ml solutions of bisphenol S (BPS), 2,2&#39;,4,4&#39;-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), or 3,3&#39;,5,5&#39;-tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) from pregnancy day 8 through lactation day 21 (weaning day). Male offspring were left untreated until postnatal day 140, where pituitaries and hypothalami were collected. Pituitaries were assed for gene expression via RNA sequencing, while specific genes were assessed for expression in hypothalami via RT-qPCR. Differential expression, as well as gene enrichment and pathway analysis, indicated that all three chemicals induced long-term changes, (mostly suppression) in pituitary genes involved in its endocrine function. BPS and BDE-47 produced effects overlapping significantly at the level of effected genes and pathways. All three chemicals altered genes and pathways of gonad and liver HP axes, while BPS altered HP-adrenal and BDE-47 altered HP-thyroid pathways specifically. All three chemicals also reduced expression of immune genes in the pituitaries. Targeted gene expression in the hypothalamus indicates a down regulation of hypothalamic endocrine control genes by BPS and BDE-47 groups, concordant with changes in the pituitary and suggests that these chemicals suppress the overall HP endocrine function. Interestingly, all three chemicals altered pituitary genes of GPCR-mediated intracellular signaling molecules, many of which are key signalers common to many pituitary responses to hormones. The results of this study show that developmental exposures to common and ubiquitous EDCs have long-term impacts on hormonal feedback control at the hypothalamic-pituitary level.</p>
