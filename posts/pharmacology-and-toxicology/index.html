M.; Nagar, P.; Nazeer, A.; Godbole, A.; Sahu, B. S.; Upadhyay, S.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565080\nBackground and aim: Huntington's Disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by misfolded mutant huntingtin proteins with expanded stretches of polyglutamines aggregating and destroying cells in the nervous system. Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus are medicinal plants used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat neurological disorders. Here, we tested the effectiveness of extracts of both medicinal plants in decreasing aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein in models of Huntington's Disease and explored the mode of action. Experimental procedure: We used two models, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and a transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, both expressing mutant huntingtin proteins with elongated polyglutamines. We assessed the effect of Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus on mutant huntingtin protein aggregation in both models, and additionally used the cell line for mechanistic studies to identify cellular pathways underlying the effects of treatment. Results and conclusion: Here, we show that an extract of Sida cordifolia inhibits aggregation of mutant huntingtin proteins. In the C. elegans model, the extract prolonged life span and improved motility of the nematode by reducing aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein. Acorus calamus did not exhibit these effects. In the transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, the extract decreased aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein by suppressing key pathways in the ER stress response caused by the mutant protein. Our results highlight the potential therapeutic value of Sida cordifolia and its promise as a source for novel medications.\nAnti-cancer compound screening identifies Aurora Kinase A inhibition as a means to favor CRISPR/Cas9 gene correction over knock-out\nAuthors: Wilbie, D.; Eising, S.; Amo-Addae, V.; Walther, J.; Bosman, E.; de Jong, O. G.; Molenaar, J. J.; Mastrobattista, E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566375\nCRISPR gene therapy holds the potential to cure a variety of genetic diseases by targeting causative mutations and introducing double stranded DNA breaks, subsequently allowing the host DNA repair mechanisms to introduce mutations. One option to introduce precise gene corrections is via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. HDR can introduce a range of desired mutations dictated by a DNA template which holds a corrected DNA sequence which is written into the targeted gene. The problem in utilizing this pathway is that CRISPR-induced double stranded DNA breaks are repaired more often through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which does not use a designed template and introduces random DNA damage in the form of insertions and deletions at the cut site. Since HDR activation depends on many interconnected processes in the cell, we aimed to screen a small library of drug compounds in clinical use or clinical development for cancer, to steer the DNA repair process towards preferential HDR activation. We included compounds in our screen based on three relevant mechanisms in CRISPR gene editing: the cell cycle, DNA repair processing and chromosomal packing. We included forty compounds, based on these criteria, screened their toxicity and dosed them in sub-toxic concentrations in cells during genome editing. Of these forty compounds we identified nine potential hits to have an effect on preferential activation of the HDR pathway over NHEJ. Alisertib, rucaparib and belinostat revealed a significant and major effect on gene editing pathway selection in further validation. Alisertib, an Aurora kinase A inhibitor, showed a particularly strong effect towards improving HDR over NHEJ. We subsequently investigated this effect at the genetic level and in a murine hepatoma cell line, which corroborated the initial findings. Alisertib led to an over 4-fold increase in preferential gene correction over gene knock-out, at a dose of 0.3 micromolar. However, the observations that Aurora kinase A inhibitors show considerable cytotoxicity (\u003c50% cell viability) and can induce morphological changes at this concentration pose a limitation for the direct use of these inhibitors as HDR enhancers. However these findings do implicate that the pathways mediated by Aurora kinase A strongly influence HDR outcomes, which warrants further investigation into the downstream pathways driving this effect.\nAntiproliferative Activity of Cephalotaxus Esters: Overcoming Chemoresistance in Cancer Therapy\nAuthors: Yong-Gonzalez, V.; Radu, C.; Calder, P. A.; Shum, D.; Frattini, M. G.; Djaballah, H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565820\nOmacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of Homoharringtonine (HHT), was approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previously, we published the synthesis of this natural alkaloid and three of its derivatives: deoxyharringtonine (DHT), deoxyhomoharringtonine (DHHT), and bis(demethyl)-deoxyharringtonine (BDHT); and reported on its refractory activity against the HL-60/RV+ cells over-expressing P-glycoprotein 1 (MDR1). In this study, we explored the extent of this resistance by first expanding the panel of established cell lines and second, using a panel of 21 leukemia patient derived primary cells. Here, we report a consistent resistance to HTT in K562 derived cells and in MES-SA/MX2 derived cells resistant to mitoxanthrone; all of them over-express MDR1, while we found U87MG-ABCG2 and H69AR cells to be very sensitive to HTT. In contrast, DHT, DHHT, and BDHT seemingly overcome this resistance due to the changes made to the acyl chain of HTT rendering the derivatives less susceptible to efflux. Surprisingly, the leukemia primary cells were very sensitive to HHT and its derivatives with low nanomolar potencies, followed by a new class of CDC7 kinase inhibitors, the anthracycline class of topoisomerase inhibitors, the DNA intercalator actinomycin-D, and the vinca alkaloid class of microtubule inhibitors. The mechanism of cell death induced by HTT and DHHT was found to be mediated via Caspase 3 cleavage leading to apoptosis. Taken together, our results confirm that HHT is a substrate for MDR1. It opens the door to a new opportunity to clinically evaluate HHT and its derivatives for the treatment of AML and other cancers.\nDextrin conjugation to colistin inhibits its toxicity, cellular uptake and acute kidney injury in vivo.\nAuthors: Varache, M.; Rizzo, S.; Sayers, E. J.; Newbury, L.; Mason, A.; Liao, C.-T.; Chiron, E.; Bourdiec, N.; Jones, A.; Fraser, D. J.; Taylor, P. R.; Jones, A. T.; Thomas, D. W.; Ferguson, E. L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565265\nThe acute kidney injury (AKI) and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, which occurs in 20-60% of patients following systemic administration of colistin, represents a challenge in the effective treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. To reduce clinical toxicity of colistin and improve targeting to infected /inflamed tissues, we previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates, whereby colistin is designed to be released by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin in infected and inflamed tissues, after passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Whilst it was evident in vitro that polymer conjugation can reduce toxicity and prolong plasma half-life, without significant reduction in antimicrobial activity of colistin, it was unclear how dextrin conjugation would alter cellular uptake and localisation of colistin in renal tubular cells in vivo. We discovered that dextrin conjugation effectively reduced colistins toxicity towards human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) in vitro, which was mirrored by significantly less cellular uptake of Oregon Green (OG)-labelled dextrin-colistin conjugate, when compared to colistin. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we revealed localisation of both, free and dextrin-bound colistin in endolysosome compartments of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Using a murine AKI model, we demonstrated dextrin-colistin conjugation dramatically diminishes both proximal tubular injury and renal accumulation of colistin. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which dextrin conjugation can overcome colistins renal toxicity and show the potential of polymer conjugation to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs.

M.; McQuate, A.; Bergado, M.; Gu, A.; Galitan, L.; Gleason, N.; Ou, H. C.; Raible, D. W.; Hernandez, R. E.; Ma, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566159\nOtotoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications with diverse mechanisms of action, many of which could be taken concurrently to treat multiple conditions. Approaches for preclinical evaluation of drug interactions that might impact ototoxicity would facilitate design of safer multi-drug regimens and mitigate unsafe polypharmacy by flagging combinations that potentially cause adverse interactions for monitoring. They may also identify protective agents that antagonize ototoxic injury. To address this need, we have developed a novel workflow that we call Parallelized Evaluation of Protection and Injury for Toxicity Assessment (PEPITA), which empowers high-throughput, semi-automated quantification of ototoxicity and otoprotection in zebrafish larvae. By applying PEPITA to characterize ototoxic drug interaction outcomes, we have discovered antagonistic interactions between macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics that confer protection against aminoglycoside-induced damage to lateral line hair cells in zebrafish larvae. Co-administration of either azithromycin or erythromycin in zebrafish protected against damage from a broad panel of aminoglycosides, at least in part via inhibiting drug uptake into hair cells via a mechanism independent from hair cell mechanotransduction. Conversely, combining macrolides with aminoglycosides in bacterial inhibition assays does not show antagonism of antimicrobial efficacy. The proof-of-concept otoprotective antagonism suggests that combinatorial interventions can potentially be developed to protect against other forms of toxicity without hindering on-target drug efficacy.\nInsights into the early-life chemical exposome of Nigerian infants and potential correlations with the developing gut microbiome\nAuthors: Oesterle, I.; Ayeni, K. I.; Ezekiel, C. N.; Berry, D.; Rompel, A.; Warth, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566030\nEarly-life exposure to natural and/or synthetic chemicals can impact acute and chronic health conditions. Here, a suspect screening workflow anchored on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to elucidate xenobiotics in breast milk and matching stool samples collected from Nigerian mother-infant pairs (n = 11) at three-time points. Potential correlations between xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, were subsequently explored. Overall, 12,192 and 16,461 features were acquired in the breast milk and stool samples, respectively. Following quality control and suspect screening, 562 and 864 features remained, respectively, with 149 of these features present in both matrices. Taking advantage of 242 authentic reference standards measured for confirmatory purposes of both, potentially beneficial and adverse xenobiotics, 34 features in breast milk and 68 features in stool were unambiguously identified and subsequently semi-quantified. Moreover, 51 and 78 features were annotated with spectral library matching, as well as 416 and 652 with in silico fragmentation in breast milk and stool, respectively. Despite that the workflow was originally optimized for polyphenols, a diverse range of other chemical classes were simultaneously identified including mycotoxins, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), antibiotics, plasticizers, perfluorinated alkylated substances, and pesticides. Spearman rank correlation of the identified features revealed significant correlations between chemicals of the same classification such as polyphenols. One-way ANOVA and differential abundance analysis of the data obtained from stool samples revealed that features of plant-based origin were elevated when complementary foods were introduced to the infants' diets. Features in the stool deemed significant by ANOVA, such as tricetin, positively correlated with the genus Blautia. Moreover, vulgaxanthin negatively correlated with Escherichia-Shigella. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study provides high-quality exposure data of matched biospecimens obtained from mother-infant pairs in sub-Saharan Africa, and showed potential correlations between the chemical exposome and the gut microbiome.\nOxycodone Self-Administration in Female Rats is Enhanced by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not by Cannabidiol, in a Progressive Ratio Procedure\nAuthors: Nguyen, J. D.; Grant, Y.; Yang, C.; Gutierrez, A.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564282\nEpidemiological evidence suggests that the legalization of cannabis may reduce opioid-related harms. Preclinical evidence of neuropharmacological interactions of endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems prompts further investigation of cannabinoids as potential therapeutics for the non-medical use of opioids. In these studies female rats, previously trained to self-administer oxycodone (0.15 mg/kg/infusion) intravenously in 6 h sessions, were allowed to self-administer oxycodone after exposure to cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by vapor inhalation and THC by injection (5.0-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Self-administration was characterized under Progressive Ratio (PR) and Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedules of reinforcement in 3 h sessions. THC decreased IVSA of oxycodone in a FR procedure but increased reward seeking in a PR procedure. CBD decreased the IVSA of oxycodone in the FR but not the PR procedure. The results are consistent with an anti-reward effect of CBD but suggest THC acts to increase the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in this procedure.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and aim: Huntington&#39;s Disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by misfolded mutant huntingtin proteins with expanded stretches of polyglutamines aggregating and destroying cells in the nervous system. Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus are medicinal plants used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to treat neurological disorders. Here, we tested the effectiveness of extracts of both medicinal plants in decreasing aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein in models of Huntington&#39;s Disease and explored the mode of action. Experimental procedure: We used two models, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and a transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, both expressing mutant huntingtin proteins with elongated polyglutamines. We assessed the effect of Sida cordifolia and Acorus calamus on mutant huntingtin protein aggregation in both models, and additionally used the cell line for mechanistic studies to identify cellular pathways underlying the effects of treatment. Results and conclusion: Here, we show that an extract of Sida cordifolia inhibits aggregation of mutant huntingtin proteins. In the C. elegans model, the extract prolonged life span and improved motility of the nematode by reducing aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein. Acorus calamus did not exhibit these effects. In the transgenic mouse neuroblastoma cell line, the extract decreased aggregation of the mutant huntingtin protein by suppressing key pathways in the ER stress response caused by the mutant protein. Our results highlight the potential therapeutic value of Sida cordifolia and its promise as a source for novel medications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR gene therapy holds the potential to cure a variety of genetic diseases by targeting causative mutations and introducing double stranded DNA breaks, subsequently allowing the host DNA repair mechanisms to introduce mutations. One option to introduce precise gene corrections is via the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. HDR can introduce a range of desired mutations dictated by a DNA template which holds a corrected DNA sequence which is written into the targeted gene. The problem in utilizing this pathway is that CRISPR-induced double stranded DNA breaks are repaired more often through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which does not use a designed template and introduces random DNA damage in the form of insertions and deletions at the cut site. Since HDR activation depends on many interconnected processes in the cell, we aimed to screen a small library of drug compounds in clinical use or clinical development for cancer, to steer the DNA repair process towards preferential HDR activation. We included compounds in our screen based on three relevant mechanisms in CRISPR gene editing: the cell cycle, DNA repair processing and chromosomal packing. We included forty compounds, based on these criteria, screened their toxicity and dosed them in sub-toxic concentrations in cells during genome editing. Of these forty compounds we identified nine potential hits to have an effect on preferential activation of the HDR pathway over NHEJ. Alisertib, rucaparib and belinostat revealed a significant and major effect on gene editing pathway selection in further validation. Alisertib, an Aurora kinase A inhibitor, showed a particularly strong effect towards improving HDR over NHEJ. We subsequently investigated this effect at the genetic level and in a murine hepatoma cell line, which corroborated the initial findings. Alisertib led to an over 4-fold increase in preferential gene correction over gene knock-out, at a dose of 0.3 micromolar. However, the observations that Aurora kinase A inhibitors show considerable cytotoxicity (&lt;50% cell viability) and can induce morphological changes at this concentration pose a limitation for the direct use of these inhibitors as HDR enhancers. However these findings do implicate that the pathways mediated by Aurora kinase A strongly influence HDR outcomes, which warrants further investigation into the downstream pathways driving this effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Omacetaxine, a semisynthetic form of Homoharringtonine (HHT), was approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Previously, we published the synthesis of this natural alkaloid and three of its derivatives: deoxyharringtonine (DHT), deoxyhomoharringtonine (DHHT), and bis(demethyl)-deoxyharringtonine (BDHT); and reported on its refractory activity against the HL-60/RV&#43; cells over-expressing P-glycoprotein 1 (MDR1). In this study, we explored the extent of this resistance by first expanding the panel of established cell lines and second, using a panel of 21 leukemia patient derived primary cells. Here, we report a consistent resistance to HTT in K562 derived cells and in MES-SA/MX2 derived cells resistant to mitoxanthrone; all of them over-express MDR1, while we found U87MG-ABCG2 and H69AR cells to be very sensitive to HTT. In contrast, DHT, DHHT, and BDHT seemingly overcome this resistance due to the changes made to the acyl chain of HTT rendering the derivatives less susceptible to efflux. Surprisingly, the leukemia primary cells were very sensitive to HHT and its derivatives with low nanomolar potencies, followed by a new class of CDC7 kinase inhibitors, the anthracycline class of topoisomerase inhibitors, the DNA intercalator actinomycin-D, and the vinca alkaloid class of microtubule inhibitors. The mechanism of cell death induced by HTT and DHHT was found to be mediated via Caspase 3 cleavage leading to apoptosis. Taken together, our results confirm that HHT is a substrate for MDR1. It opens the door to a new opportunity to clinically evaluate HHT and its derivatives for the treatment of AML and other cancers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The acute kidney injury (AKI) and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, which occurs in 20-60% of patients following systemic administration of colistin, represents a challenge in the effective treatment of multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. To reduce clinical toxicity of colistin and improve targeting to infected /inflamed tissues, we previously developed dextrin-colistin conjugates, whereby colistin is designed to be released by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin in infected and inflamed tissues, after passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Whilst it was evident in vitro that polymer conjugation can reduce toxicity and prolong plasma half-life, without significant reduction in antimicrobial activity of colistin, it was unclear how dextrin conjugation would alter cellular uptake and localisation of colistin in renal tubular cells in vivo. We discovered that dextrin conjugation effectively reduced colistins toxicity towards human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) in vitro, which was mirrored by significantly less cellular uptake of Oregon Green (OG)-labelled dextrin-colistin conjugate, when compared to colistin. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we revealed localisation of both, free and dextrin-bound colistin in endolysosome compartments of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Using a murine AKI model, we demonstrated dextrin-colistin conjugation dramatically diminishes both proximal tubular injury and renal accumulation of colistin. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which dextrin conjugation can overcome colistins renal toxicity and show the potential of polymer conjugation to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs.

        <p class="abstract">Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications with diverse mechanisms of action, many of which could be taken concurrently to treat multiple conditions. Approaches for preclinical evaluation of drug interactions that might impact ototoxicity would facilitate design of safer multi-drug regimens and mitigate unsafe polypharmacy by flagging combinations that potentially cause adverse interactions for monitoring. They may also identify protective agents that antagonize ototoxic injury. To address this need, we have developed a novel workflow that we call Parallelized Evaluation of Protection and Injury for Toxicity Assessment (PEPITA), which empowers high-throughput, semi-automated quantification of ototoxicity and otoprotection in zebrafish larvae. By applying PEPITA to characterize ototoxic drug interaction outcomes, we have discovered antagonistic interactions between macrolide and aminoglycoside antibiotics that confer protection against aminoglycoside-induced damage to lateral line hair cells in zebrafish larvae. Co-administration of either azithromycin or erythromycin in zebrafish protected against damage from a broad panel of aminoglycosides, at least in part via inhibiting drug uptake into hair cells via a mechanism independent from hair cell mechanotransduction. Conversely, combining macrolides with aminoglycosides in bacterial inhibition assays does not show antagonism of antimicrobial efficacy. The proof-of-concept otoprotective antagonism suggests that combinatorial interventions can potentially be developed to protect against other forms of toxicity without hindering on-target drug efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early-life exposure to natural and/or synthetic chemicals can impact acute and chronic health conditions. Here, a suspect screening workflow anchored on high-resolution mass spectrometry was applied to elucidate xenobiotics in breast milk and matching stool samples collected from Nigerian mother-infant pairs (n = 11) at three-time points. Potential correlations between xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, were subsequently explored. Overall, 12,192 and 16,461 features were acquired in the breast milk and stool samples, respectively. Following quality control and suspect screening, 562 and 864 features remained, respectively, with 149 of these features present in both matrices. Taking advantage of 242 authentic reference standards measured for confirmatory purposes of both, potentially beneficial and adverse xenobiotics, 34 features in breast milk and 68 features in stool were unambiguously identified and subsequently semi-quantified. Moreover, 51 and 78 features were annotated with spectral library matching, as well as 416 and 652 with in silico fragmentation in breast milk and stool, respectively. Despite that the workflow was originally optimized for polyphenols, a diverse range of other chemical classes were simultaneously identified including mycotoxins, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), antibiotics, plasticizers, perfluorinated alkylated substances, and pesticides. Spearman rank correlation of the identified features revealed significant correlations between chemicals of the same classification such as polyphenols. One-way ANOVA and differential abundance analysis of the data obtained from stool samples revealed that features of plant-based origin were elevated when complementary foods were introduced to the infants&#39; diets. Features in the stool deemed significant by ANOVA, such as tricetin, positively correlated with the genus Blautia. Moreover, vulgaxanthin negatively correlated with Escherichia-Shigella. Despite the limited sample size, this exploratory study provides high-quality exposure data of matched biospecimens obtained from mother-infant pairs in sub-Saharan Africa, and showed potential correlations between the chemical exposome and the gut microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemiological evidence suggests that the legalization of cannabis may reduce opioid-related harms. Preclinical evidence of neuropharmacological interactions of endogenous cannabinoid and opioid systems prompts further investigation of cannabinoids as potential therapeutics for the non-medical use of opioids. In these studies female rats, previously trained to self-administer oxycodone (0.15 mg/kg/infusion) intravenously in 6 h sessions, were allowed to self-administer oxycodone after exposure to cannabidiol (CBD) and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by vapor inhalation and THC by injection (5.0-20 mg/kg, i.p.). Self-administration was characterized under Progressive Ratio (PR) and Fixed Ratio (FR) 1 schedules of reinforcement in 3 h sessions. THC decreased IVSA of oxycodone in a FR procedure but increased reward seeking in a PR procedure. CBD decreased the IVSA of oxycodone in the FR but not the PR procedure. The results are consistent with an anti-reward effect of CBD but suggest THC acts to increase the reinforcing efficacy of oxycodone in this procedure.</p>
