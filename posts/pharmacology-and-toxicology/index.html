S.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 34.3, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559713\nPlastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.\nDissolving microneedle array patches containing mesoporous silica nanoparticles of different pore sizes as a tunable sustained release platform\nAuthors: Paris, J. L.; Vora, L. K.; Perez-Moreno, A. M.; Naser, Y. A.; Anjani, Q. K.; Canas, J. A.; Torres, M. J.; Mayorga, C.; Donnelly, R. F.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559712\nDissolving microneedle array patches (DMAPs) enable efficient and painless delivery of therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum and into the upper layers of the skin. Furthermore, this delivery strategy can be combined with the sustained release of nanoparticles to enhance the therapeutic potential in a wide variety of pathological scenarios. Among the different types of nanoparticles that can be included in microneedle formulations, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) of tuneable pore sizes constitute a promising tool as drug delivery systems for cargos of a wide range of molecular weights. However, the development of efficient methods to produce DMAP containing large amounts of MSNs of different pore sizes has not been reported. In this work, DMAP containing MSNs with varying pore sizes was prepared and characterized. After synthesizing and characterizing MSNs, the pore size of the nanoparticles (in the range of 3 to 13 nm for S-MSN and XL-MSN, respectively) was observed to influence the loading and release of both small and large molecules, using fluorescein and ovalbumin (OVA) as model cargos. Moreover, a new preparation method was developed to produce DMAP containing large amounts of these MSNs located mainly in the microneedle tips. The successful insertion of these DMAPs was confirmed in vitro (using Parafilm), ex vivo (using excised neonatal porcine skin) and in vivo (in the back of mice) models. The dissolution of the microneedles and deposition of the nanoparticles inside the skin were also confirmed both ex vivo and in vivo using fluorescent nanoparticles, with complete microneedle dissolution after 2 h of insertion in vivo. Through histological studies, the microneedle-delivered MSNs were found to end up inside antigen presenting cells in the skin tissue (either F4/80+ macrophages or CD11c+ dendritic cells). For this reason, the uptake and biological effect of the MSNs was evaluated in vitro in dendritic cells, showing that while smaller pore MSNs were taken up by cells more efficiently (with over 80 % of S-MSN uptake compared to ca. 55 % for XL-MSNs), the dendritic cells treated with OVA-loaded XL-MSNs underwent the largest degree of activation (inducing over 25 % of CD40 expression compared to less than 2 % for OVA-loaded S- MSNs). Finally, the immune response to OVA-loaded XL-MSNs in mice was evaluated after repeated administration either subcutaneously or through DMAP. The results of this experiment showed comparable levels of anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulin generation through both routes of administration (with significant production of OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies), highlighting the good potential of this delivery platform for vaccination or immunotherapy applications.\nAnti-prion drugs do not improve survival in knock-in models of inherited prion disease\nAuthors: Walsh, D.; Rees, J.; Mehra, S.; Bourkas, M.; Kaczmarczyk, L.; Stuart, E.; Jackson, W.; Watts, J.; Supattapone, S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559951\nPrion diseases uniquely manifest in three distinct forms: inherited, sporadic, and infectious. Wild-type prions are responsible for the sporadic and infectious versions, while mutant prions cause inherited variants like fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD). Although some drugs can prolong prion incubation times up to four-fold in rodent models of infectious prion diseases, no effective treatments for FFI and fCJD have been found. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of various anti-prion drugs on newly-developed knock-in mouse models for FFI and fCJD. These models express bank vole prion protein (PrP) with the pathogenic D178N and E200K mutations. We applied various drug regimens known to be highly effective against wild-type prions in vivo as well as a brain-penetrant compound that inhibits mutant PrPSc propagation in vitro. None of the regimens tested (Anle138b, IND24, Anle138b + IND24, cellulose ether, and PSCMA) significantly extended disease-free survival or prevented mutant PrPSc accumulation in either knock-in mouse model, despite their ability to induce strain adaptation of mutant prions. Paradoxically, the combination of Anle138b and IND24 appeared to accelerate disease by 16% and 26% in kiBVIE200K and kiBVID178N mice, respectively, and accelerated the aggregation of mutant PrP molecules in vitro. Our results show that anti-prion drugs originally developed to treat infectious prion diseases do not necessarily work for inherited prion diseases, and that the recombinant sPMCA is not a reliable platform for identifying compounds that target mutant prions. This work underscores the need to develop therapies and validate screening assays specifically for mutant prions.\nCurcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion\nAuthors: Septisetyani, E. P. P.; Lestari, D.; Paramitasari, K. A.; Prasetyaningrum, P. W.; Kastian, R. F.; Santoso, A.; Eriani, K.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560070\nTurmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TE's impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 lower case Greek muM and 10 lower case Greek muM for curcumin and 1 lower case Greek mug/ml and 10 lower case Greek mug/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models.

D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559370\nTenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

M.; Grant, Y.; Taffe, M. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556932\nThe use of Electronic Drug Delivery Systems (EDDS, \"e-cigarettes\") to ingest nicotine and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has surged in adolescent populations in the United States, as five times as many high-school seniors vape nicotine daily as use tobacco. At the same time 19.5% of seniors use cannabis at least monthly, with 12% using EDDS to deliver it. This study was conducted to examine the impact of repeated adolescent vapor inhalation of nicotine and THC in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30-minute sessions of vapor inhalation, twice daily, from Post-Natal Day (PND) 31 to PND 40. Conditions included vapor from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, Nicotine (60 mg/mL in the PG), THC (100 mg/mL in the PG) or the combination of Nicotine (60 mg/mL) and THC (100 mg/mL). Rats were assessed on wheel activity, heroin anti-nociception and nicotine and heroin vapor volitional exposure during adulthood. Nicotine exposed rats exhibited few differences as adults, but were less sensitive to anti-nociceptive effects of heroin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). THC- and THC+Nicotine-exposed rats were less spontaneously active, and obtained fewer nicotine vapor deliveries as adults. In contrast, THC exposed rats obtained volitional heroin vapor at rates indistinguishable from the non-THC-exposed groups. Repeated THC exposure also caused tolerance to temperature-disrupting effects of THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.). These studies further confirm that the effects of repeated vapor exposure to THC in adolescence last into early to middle adulthood, including decreased volitional consumption of nicotine. Effects of repeated nicotine in adolescence were comparatively minor.\nAssessing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Fish Fillet Using Non-Targeted Analyses\nAuthors: Boatman, A. K.; Chappel, J. R.; Polera, M. E.; Dodds, J. N.; Belcher, S. M.; Baker, E. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555938\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of thousands of man-made chemicals that are persistent and highly stable in the environment. The diverse structures of PFAS give them different chemical properties that influence their solubility in different environmental matrices and biological tissues. PFAS in drinking water have been extensively studied, but information on their presence in fish and other exposure routes is limited. To address this, a non-targeted analysis using liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) was performed to evaluate PFAS in fish fillets from in central North Carolina and compare with PFAS data from previously published water. A total of 22 different PFAS were detected in the fillets, including only 4 of the PFAS reported in water. Both more PFAS types and higher concentrations were observed in fish caught near a known PFAS point-source compared to those from a reservoir used for drinking water and recreation. Median fillet PFOS levels were 54 ppb in fish closest to the point source and 14-20 ppb in fish from the reservoir. Thus, future PFAS monitoring should include both targeted and non-targeted analyses of both water and fish to increase understanding of human exposure risks and ecosystem impacts. SYNOPSISFish fillet samples were collected from five sites in North Carolina. PFAS were detected in all samples and differences in analytes and abundances were observed at the different sites.

        <p class="abstract">Plastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dissolving microneedle array patches (DMAPs) enable efficient and painless delivery of therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum and into the upper layers of the skin. Furthermore, this delivery strategy can be combined with the sustained release of nanoparticles to enhance the therapeutic potential in a wide variety of pathological scenarios. Among the different types of nanoparticles that can be included in microneedle formulations, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) of tuneable pore sizes constitute a promising tool as drug delivery systems for cargos of a wide range of molecular weights. However, the development of efficient methods to produce DMAP containing large amounts of MSNs of different pore sizes has not been reported. In this work, DMAP containing MSNs with varying pore sizes was prepared and characterized. After synthesizing and characterizing MSNs, the pore size of the nanoparticles (in the range of 3 to 13 nm for S-MSN and XL-MSN, respectively) was observed to influence the loading and release of both small and large molecules, using fluorescein and ovalbumin (OVA) as model cargos. Moreover, a new preparation method was developed to produce DMAP containing large amounts of these MSNs located mainly in the microneedle tips. The successful insertion of these DMAPs was confirmed in vitro (using Parafilm), ex vivo (using excised neonatal porcine skin) and in vivo (in the back of mice) models. The dissolution of the microneedles and deposition of the nanoparticles inside the skin were also confirmed both ex vivo and in vivo using fluorescent nanoparticles, with complete microneedle dissolution after 2 h of insertion in vivo. Through histological studies, the microneedle-delivered MSNs were found to end up inside antigen presenting cells in the skin tissue (either F4/80&#43; macrophages or CD11c&#43; dendritic cells). For this reason, the uptake and biological effect of the MSNs was evaluated in vitro in dendritic cells, showing that while smaller pore MSNs were taken up by cells more efficiently (with over 80 % of S-MSN uptake compared to ca. 55 % for XL-MSNs), the dendritic cells treated with OVA-loaded XL-MSNs underwent the largest degree of activation (inducing over 25 % of CD40 expression compared to less than 2 % for OVA-loaded S- MSNs). Finally, the immune response to OVA-loaded XL-MSNs in mice was evaluated after repeated administration either subcutaneously or through DMAP. The results of this experiment showed comparable levels of anti-ovalbumin immunoglobulin generation through both routes of administration (with significant production of OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies), highlighting the good potential of this delivery platform for vaccination or immunotherapy applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prion diseases uniquely manifest in three distinct forms: inherited, sporadic, and infectious. Wild-type prions are responsible for the sporadic and infectious versions, while mutant prions cause inherited variants like fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD). Although some drugs can prolong prion incubation times up to four-fold in rodent models of infectious prion diseases, no effective treatments for FFI and fCJD have been found. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of various anti-prion drugs on newly-developed knock-in mouse models for FFI and fCJD. These models express bank vole prion protein (PrP) with the pathogenic D178N and E200K mutations. We applied various drug regimens known to be highly effective against wild-type prions in vivo as well as a brain-penetrant compound that inhibits mutant PrPSc propagation in vitro. None of the regimens tested (Anle138b, IND24, Anle138b &#43; IND24, cellulose ether, and PSCMA) significantly extended disease-free survival or prevented mutant PrPSc accumulation in either knock-in mouse model, despite their ability to induce strain adaptation of mutant prions. Paradoxically, the combination of Anle138b and IND24 appeared to accelerate disease by 16% and 26% in kiBVIE200K and kiBVID178N mice, respectively, and accelerated the aggregation of mutant PrP molecules in vitro. Our results show that anti-prion drugs originally developed to treat infectious prion diseases do not necessarily work for inherited prion diseases, and that the recombinant sPMCA is not a reliable platform for identifying compounds that target mutant prions. This work underscores the need to develop therapies and validate screening assays specifically for mutant prions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Turmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TE&#39;s impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 lower case Greek muM and 10 lower case Greek muM for curcumin and 1 lower case Greek mug/ml and 10 lower case Greek mug/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models. Keywords: COVID-19, curcumin, pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2, syncytia, turmeric extract.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

        <p class="abstract">The use of Electronic Drug Delivery Systems (EDDS, &#34;e-cigarettes&#34;) to ingest nicotine and {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has surged in adolescent populations in the United States, as five times as many high-school seniors vape nicotine daily as use tobacco. At the same time 19.5% of seniors use cannabis at least monthly, with 12% using EDDS to deliver it. This study was conducted to examine the impact of repeated adolescent vapor inhalation of nicotine and THC in rats.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30-minute sessions of vapor inhalation, twice daily, from Post-Natal Day (PND) 31 to PND 40. Conditions included vapor from the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle, Nicotine (60 mg/mL in the PG), THC (100 mg/mL in the PG) or the combination of Nicotine (60 mg/mL) and THC (100 mg/mL). Rats were assessed on wheel activity, heroin anti-nociception and nicotine and heroin vapor volitional exposure during adulthood.

Nicotine exposed rats exhibited few differences as adults, but were less sensitive to anti-nociceptive effects of heroin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). THC- and THC&#43;Nicotine-exposed rats were less spontaneously active, and obtained fewer nicotine vapor deliveries as adults. In contrast, THC exposed rats obtained volitional heroin vapor at rates indistinguishable from the non-THC-exposed groups. Repeated THC exposure also caused tolerance to temperature-disrupting effects of THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.).

These studies further confirm that the effects of repeated vapor exposure to THC in adolescence last into early to middle adulthood, including decreased volitional consumption of nicotine. Effects of repeated nicotine in adolescence were comparatively minor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of thousands of man-made chemicals that are persistent and highly stable in the environment. The diverse structures of PFAS give them different chemical properties that influence their solubility in different environmental matrices and biological tissues. PFAS in drinking water have been extensively studied, but information on their presence in fish and other exposure routes is limited. To address this, a non-targeted analysis using liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) was performed to evaluate PFAS in fish fillets from in central North Carolina and compare with PFAS data from previously published water. A total of 22 different PFAS were detected in the fillets, including only 4 of the PFAS reported in water. Both more PFAS types and higher concentrations were observed in fish caught near a known PFAS point-source compared to those from a reservoir used for drinking water and recreation. Median fillet PFOS levels were 54 ppb in fish closest to the point source and 14-20 ppb in fish from the reservoir. Thus, future PFAS monitoring should include both targeted and non-targeted analyses of both water and fish to increase understanding of human exposure risks and ecosystem impacts.

SYNOPSISFish fillet samples were collected from five sites in North Carolina. PFAS were detected in all samples and differences in analytes and abundances were observed at the different sites.
