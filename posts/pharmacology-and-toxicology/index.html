AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated by and influences production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We tested the mechanistic role of AMPK in low glucose induced changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is elevated in patients with diabetes. MethodsMacrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells, primary macrophage bone marrow derived macrophages obtained from wild type mice or AMPK {gamma}1 gain-of-function mice were utilized, as were AMPK1/2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Allosteric AMPK activators PF-06409577 and BI-9774 were used, in conjunction with inhibitor SBI-0206965 were also used. We examined changes in protein phosphorylation/expression using western blotting, and protein localisation using immunofluorescence. Metabolic function was assessed using extracellular flux analyses and luciferase-based ATP assay. Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Oxidative stress was detected using a fluorescence-based ROS assay, and cell viability was examined using flow cytometry. ResultsMacrophages exposed to low glucose showed a transient and modest activation of AMPK and a metabolic shift towards increased oxidative phosphorylation. Low glucose induced oxidative stress and increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Pharmacological activation of AMPK by PF-06409577 and BI-9774 attenuated low glucose-induced MIF release, with a similar trend noted with genetic activation using AMPK{gamma}1 gain-of-function (D316A) mice, which produced a mild effect on low glucose-induced MIF release. Inhibition of NFB signalling diminished MIF release and AMPK activation modestly but significantly reduced low glucose-induced nuclear translocation of NFB. AMPK activation did not alter low glucose-induced oxidative stress in macrophages but application of AMPK inhibitor SBI-0206965 enhanced oxidative stress in macrophages and in AMPK knockout MEFs, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism Conclusions/interpretationTaken together, these data indicate that pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses release of MIF from macrophages. This is mediated by reduced activation of NFB signalling in response to low glucose-induced oxidative stress and suggests that pharmacological AMPK activation could be a useful strategy for mitigating hypoglycemia-induced inflammation.

C_FIG\nDermonecrosis caused by spitting cobra snakebite results from toxin potentiation and is prevented by the repurposed drug varespladib\nAuthors: Bartlett, K. E.; Hall, S. R.; Rasmussen, S. A.; Crittenden, E.; Dawson, C. A.; Albulescu, L.-O.; Laprade, W. M.; Harrison, R. A.; Saviola, A. J.; Modahl, C. M.; Jenkins, T. P.; Wilkinson, M. C.; Gutierrez, J. M.; Casewell, N. R.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549878\nSnakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes substantial mortality and morbidity globally. The venom of African spitting cobras often causes permanent injury via tissue-destructive dermonecrosis at the bite site, which is ineffectively treated by current antivenoms. To address this therapeutic gap, we identified the aetiological venom toxins responsible for causing local dermonecrosis. While cytotoxic three-finger toxins were primarily responsible for causing spitting cobra cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes, their potentiation by phospholipases A2 toxins was essential to cause dermonecrosis in vivo. This evidence of probable toxin synergism suggests that a single toxin-family inhibiting drug could prevent local envenoming. We show that local injection with the repurposed phospholipase A2-inhibiting drug varespladib significantly prevents local tissue damage caused by several spitting cobra venoms in murine models of envenoming. Our findings therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy to more effectively prevent life-changing morbidity caused by snakebite in rural Africa.\nPharmacological and behavioral effects of tryptamines present in psilocybin-containing mushrooms\nAuthors: Rakoczy, R. J.; Runge, G. N.; Sen, A. K.; Sandoval, O.; Nguyen, Q.; Roberts, B. R.; Sciortino, J. H.; Gibbons, W. J.; Friedberg, L. M.; Jones, J. A.; McMurray, M. S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563138\nDemand for more efficacious antidepressants, particularly those with a rapid onset of action, has resulted in a reevaluation of psychedelic drugs for their therapeutic potential. Several tryptamines found in psilocybin-containing 'magic' mushrooms share chemical similarities with psilocybin, and early work suggests they may also share receptor targets. However, few studies have explored their pharmacological and behavioral effects. To accomplish this, we compared baeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin with psilocybin to determine if they are metabolized by the same enzymes, penetrate the blood brain barrier, serve as ligands for similar centrally located receptors, and modulate behavior in rodents similarly. We first assessed the stability and optimal storage and handling conditions for each compound. In vitro enzyme kinetics assays then found that all compounds shared nearly identical rates of dephosphorylation via alkaline phosphatase and metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Further, we found that only the dephosphorylated products of baeocystin and norbaeocystin could cross a blood brain barrier mimetic to a similar degree as the dephosphorylated form of psilocybin, psilocin. Behaviorally, only psilocybin was found to induce head twitch responses in rats, a marker of 5HT2A agonism and indicator of the compound's hallucinogenic potential. However, like psilocybin, norbaeocystin was also found to improve outcomes in the forced swim test. All compounds were found to cause minimal changes to metrics of renal and hepatic health, suggesting innocuous safety profiles. Collectively, this work suggests that other naturally-occurring tryptamines, especially norbaeocystin, may share the same therapeutic potential as psilocybin, but without causing hallucinations.\nNonspecific membrane bilayer perturbations by ivermectin underlie SARS-CoV-2 in vitro activity\nAuthors: Eastman, R. T.; Rusinova, R.; Herold, K. F.; Huang, X.-P.; Dranchak, P.; Voss, T. C.; Rana, S.; Shrimp, J. H.; White, A. D.; Hemmings, H. C.; Roth, B. L.; Inglese, J.; Andersen, O. S.; Dahlin, J. L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563088\nSince it was proposed as a potential host-directed antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2, the antiparasitic drug ivermectin has been investigated thoroughly in clinical trials, which have provided insufficient support for its clinical efficacy. To examine the potential for ivermectin to be repurposed as an antiviral agent, we therefore undertook a series of preclinical studies. Consistent with early reports, ivermectin decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in in vitro models at low micromolar concentrations, five- to ten-fold higher than the reported toxic clinical concentration. At similar concentrations, ivermectin also decreased cell viability and increased biomarkers of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic and profiling studies revealed that ivermectin nonspecifically perturbs membrane bilayers at the same concentrations where it decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, resulting in nonspecific modulation of membrane-based targets such as G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. These results suggest that a primary molecular mechanism for the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin may be nonspecific membrane perturbation, indicating that ivermectin is unlikely to be translatable into a safe and effective antiviral agent. These results and experimental workflow provide a useful paradigm for performing preclinical studies on (pandemic-related) drug repurposing candidates.\nBisphenol S moderately decreases the expression of syncytiotrophoblast marker genes and induces apoptosis in human trophoblast lineages.\nAuthors: Appiah, E.; Salamah, J.; Cheeran, E.; Lee, B.-K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563141\nBisphenol S (BPS) is currently used in the manufacturing of several household equipment such as water pipes and food containers. Hence, its entrance into the human body is almost inevitable. The presence of BPS in body fluids has been reported. However, its potential toxicity, especially on human placenta development and pregnancy progression, has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the impacts of BPS on self-renewal and differentiation potentials of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) by exposing them to three different BPS concentrations during both self-renewal and differentiation of TSCs into syncytiotrophoblast (ST), extravillous trophoblast (EVT), and trophoblast organoids. Interestingly, BPS treatment did not affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and stemness of the TSCs but it led to induction of apoptosis in each trophoblast lineage. BPS altered the expression of several fusion-related genes. However, this alteration did not translate into significant morphological defects in the STs and organoids. Moreover, BPS did not impair the differentiation of TSCs into EVTs. These findings suggest that the presence of BPS at the feto-maternal interface may exaggerate trophoblast apoptosis and moderately inhibit the trophoblast fusion pathway to affect placenta development and pregnancy. Our study offers valuable insights into the toxicity of BPS on human placenta development, emphasizing the need for further research on the relationship between maternal serum levels of BPS and pregnancy complications.\nCharacterization of Gαs and Gαolf activation by catechol and non-catechol dopamine D1 receptor agonists\nAuthors: Nguyen, A. M.; Semeano, A.; Quach, V.; Inoue, A.; Nichols, D. E.; Yano, H.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560682\nThe dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nTenofovir Activation is Diminished in the Brain and Liver of Creatine Kinase Brain-Type Knockout Mice\nAuthors: Eberhard, C. D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559370\nTenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

        <p class="abstract">Aims/hypothesisAcute hypoglycemia promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increasing risk for cardiovascular events in diabetes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is regulated by and influences production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We tested the mechanistic role of AMPK in low glucose induced changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is elevated in patients with diabetes.

MethodsMacrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells, primary macrophage bone marrow derived macrophages obtained from wild type mice or AMPK {gamma}1 gain-of-function mice were utilized, as were AMPK1/2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Allosteric AMPK activators PF-06409577 and BI-9774 were used, in conjunction with inhibitor SBI-0206965 were also used. We examined changes in protein phosphorylation/expression using western blotting, and protein localisation using immunofluorescence. Metabolic function was assessed using extracellular flux analyses and luciferase-based ATP assay. Cytokine release was quantified by ELISA. Oxidative stress was detected using a fluorescence-based ROS assay, and cell viability was examined using flow cytometry.

ResultsMacrophages exposed to low glucose showed a transient and modest activation of AMPK and a metabolic shift towards increased oxidative phosphorylation. Low glucose induced oxidative stress and increased release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Pharmacological activation of AMPK by PF-06409577 and BI-9774 attenuated low glucose-induced MIF release, with a similar trend noted with genetic activation using AMPK{gamma}1 gain-of-function (D316A) mice, which produced a mild effect on low glucose-induced MIF release. Inhibition of NFB signalling diminished MIF release and AMPK activation modestly but significantly reduced low glucose-induced nuclear translocation of NFB. AMPK activation did not alter low glucose-induced oxidative stress in macrophages but application of AMPK inhibitor SBI-0206965 enhanced oxidative stress in macrophages and in AMPK knockout MEFs, suggesting an AMPK-independent mechanism

Conclusions/interpretationTaken together, these data indicate that pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses release of MIF from macrophages. This is mediated by reduced activation of NFB signalling in response to low glucose-induced oxidative stress and suggests that pharmacological AMPK activation could be a useful strategy for mitigating hypoglycemia-induced inflammation.

Low glucose induces pro-inflammatory MIF release from macrophages, and pharmacological AMPK activation suppresses the release of MIF. AMPK/ NFB signalling pathway is involved, which may be a new strategy to attenuate the pro-inflammatory response in hypoglycemia.

        <p class="abstract">Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that causes substantial mortality and morbidity globally. The venom of African spitting cobras often causes permanent injury via tissue-destructive dermonecrosis at the bite site, which is ineffectively treated by current antivenoms. To address this therapeutic gap, we identified the aetiological venom toxins responsible for causing local dermonecrosis. While cytotoxic three-finger toxins were primarily responsible for causing spitting cobra cytotoxicity in cultured keratinocytes, their potentiation by phospholipases A2 toxins was essential to cause dermonecrosis in vivo. This evidence of probable toxin synergism suggests that a single toxin-family inhibiting drug could prevent local envenoming. We show that local injection with the repurposed phospholipase A2-inhibiting drug varespladib significantly prevents local tissue damage caused by several spitting cobra venoms in murine models of envenoming. Our findings therefore provide a new therapeutic strategy to more effectively prevent life-changing morbidity caused by snakebite in rural Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Demand for more efficacious antidepressants, particularly those with a rapid onset of action, has resulted in a reevaluation of psychedelic drugs for their therapeutic potential. Several tryptamines found in psilocybin-containing &#39;magic&#39; mushrooms share chemical similarities with psilocybin, and early work suggests they may also share receptor targets. However, few studies have explored their pharmacological and behavioral effects. To accomplish this, we compared baeocystin, norbaeocystin, and aeruginascin with psilocybin to determine if they are metabolized by the same enzymes, penetrate the blood brain barrier, serve as ligands for similar centrally located receptors, and modulate behavior in rodents similarly. We first assessed the stability and optimal storage and handling conditions for each compound. In vitro enzyme kinetics assays then found that all compounds shared nearly identical rates of dephosphorylation via alkaline phosphatase and metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Further, we found that only the dephosphorylated products of baeocystin and norbaeocystin could cross a blood brain barrier mimetic to a similar degree as the dephosphorylated form of psilocybin, psilocin. Behaviorally, only psilocybin was found to induce head twitch responses in rats, a marker of 5HT2A agonism and indicator of the compound&#39;s hallucinogenic potential. However, like psilocybin, norbaeocystin was also found to improve outcomes in the forced swim test. All compounds were found to cause minimal changes to metrics of renal and hepatic health, suggesting innocuous safety profiles. Collectively, this work suggests that other naturally-occurring tryptamines, especially norbaeocystin, may share the same therapeutic potential as psilocybin, but without causing hallucinations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Since it was proposed as a potential host-directed antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2, the antiparasitic drug ivermectin has been investigated thoroughly in clinical trials, which have provided insufficient support for its clinical efficacy. To examine the potential for ivermectin to be repurposed as an antiviral agent, we therefore undertook a series of preclinical studies. Consistent with early reports, ivermectin decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral burden in in vitro models at low micromolar concentrations, five- to ten-fold higher than the reported toxic clinical concentration. At similar concentrations, ivermectin also decreased cell viability and increased biomarkers of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further mechanistic and profiling studies revealed that ivermectin nonspecifically perturbs membrane bilayers at the same concentrations where it decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, resulting in nonspecific modulation of membrane-based targets such as G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. These results suggest that a primary molecular mechanism for the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin may be nonspecific membrane perturbation, indicating that ivermectin is unlikely to be translatable into a safe and effective antiviral agent. These results and experimental workflow provide a useful paradigm for performing preclinical studies on (pandemic-related) drug repurposing candidates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bisphenol S (BPS) is currently used in the manufacturing of several household equipment such as water pipes and food containers. Hence, its entrance into the human body is almost inevitable. The presence of BPS in body fluids has been reported. However, its potential toxicity, especially on human placenta development and pregnancy progression, has not been explored. In this study, we assessed the impacts of BPS on self-renewal and differentiation potentials of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) by exposing them to three different BPS concentrations during both self-renewal and differentiation of TSCs into syncytiotrophoblast (ST), extravillous trophoblast (EVT), and trophoblast organoids. Interestingly, BPS treatment did not affect the proliferation, cell cycle, and stemness of the TSCs but it led to induction of apoptosis in each trophoblast lineage. BPS altered the expression of several fusion-related genes. However, this alteration did not translate into significant morphological defects in the STs and organoids. Moreover, BPS did not impair the differentiation of TSCs into EVTs. These findings suggest that the presence of BPS at the feto-maternal interface may exaggerate trophoblast apoptosis and moderately inhibit the trophoblast fusion pathway to affect placenta development and pregnancy. Our study offers valuable insights into the toxicity of BPS on human placenta development, emphasizing the need for further research on the relationship between maternal serum levels of BPS and pregnancy complications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.
