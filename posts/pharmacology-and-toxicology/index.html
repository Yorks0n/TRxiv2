G.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571234\nMotivational disorders such as apathy syndrome are highly prevalent across neurological disorders but do not yet have an agreed treatment approach. The use of translational behavioural models can provide a route through which to meaningfully screen novel drug targets. Methods that utilise food deprivation in contrived environments may lack the sensitivity to detect deficits in self-initiated or self-driven behaviour. Animals monitored in more naturalistic environments may display more ethologically-relevant behaviours of greater translational value. Here, we aimed to validate a novel, non-appetitive effort-based foraging task as a measure of motivational state in mice. In this task, the mouse can freely choose to exert effort to forage bedding material and shuttle it back to a safe and enclosed environment. The amount of bedding material foraged is used as a readout of motivational state. Acute dopaminergic modulation with haloperidol, amphetamine and methylphenidate, and two phenotypic models known to induce motivational deficits (healthy ageing and chronic administration of corticosterone) were used to validate this task. Consistent with other effort-based decision-making tasks we find that foraging behaviour is sensitive to acute modulation of dopaminergic transmission. We find that both phenotypic models induce differing deficits in various aspects of foraging behaviour suggesting that the task may be used to parse different behavioural profiles from distinct disease phenotypes. Thus, without requiring extended training periods or physiological deprivation, this task may represent a refined and translational preclinical measure of motivation.\nAn integrative data-centric approach to derivation and characterization of an adverse outcome pathway network for cadmium-induced toxicity\nAuthors: Sahoo, A. K.; Chivukula, N.; Ramesh, K.; Singha, J.; Marigoudar, S. R.; Sharma, K. V.; Samal, A.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571252\nCadmium is a prominent toxic heavy metal that contaminates both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Owing to its high biological half-life and low excretion rates, cadmium causes a variety of adverse biological outcomes. Adverse outcome pathway (AOP) networks were envisioned to systematically capture toxicological information to enable risk assessment and chemical regulation. Here, we leveraged AOP-Wiki and integrated heterogeneous data from four other exposome-relevant resources to build the first AOP network relevant for inorganic cadmium-induced toxicity. From AOP-Wiki, we filtered 309 high confidence AOPs, identified 312 key events (KEs) associated with inorganic cadmium, and thereafter, curated 30 cadmium relevant AOPs (cadmium-AOPs), using a data-centric approach. By constructing the undirected AOP network, we identified a large connected component of 18 cadmium-AOPs. Further, we analyzed the directed network of 59 KEs and 82 key event relationships (KERs) in the largest component using graph-theoretic approaches. Subsequently, we mined published literature using artificial intelligence-based tools to provide auxiliary evidence of cadmium association for all KEs in the largest component. Finally, we performed case studies to verify the rationality of cadmium-induced toxicity in humans and aquatic species. Overall, cadmium-AOP network constructed in this study will aid ongoing research in systems toxicology and chemical exposome.\nDysregulated Platelet Function in Patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19\nAuthors: Aggarwal, A.; Singh, T. K.; Pham, M.; Godwin, M.; Chen, R.; McIntyre, T. M.; Chung, M. K.; Jennings, C.; Ali, M.; Park, H.; Englund, K.; Khorana, A. A.; Svensson, L.; Kapadia, S. R.; McCrae, K. R.; Cameron, S. J.\nScore: 63.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.18.545507\nBackgroundPost-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also referred as Long-COVID, sometimes follows COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC. AimOur objective was to evaluate the platelet function and thrombotic potential in patients following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 with clear symptoms of PASC. MethodsPASC patients and matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under shear stress conditions. ResultsA mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed and platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed when stimulating healthy platelets after incubation with plasma from healthy individuals. ConclusionsPASC patients show dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also referred as Long-COVID, sometimes follows COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC.

AimOur objective was to evaluate the platelet function and thrombotic potential in patients following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 with clear symptoms of PASC.

MethodsPASC patients and matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under shear stress conditions.

ResultsA mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed and platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed when stimulating healthy platelets after incubation with plasma from healthy individuals.

ConclusionsPASC patients show dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
