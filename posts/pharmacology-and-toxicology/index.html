Since these diseases target the most vulnerable communities who are disadvantaged by health and socio-economic factors, new agents should be, if possible, easy-to-prepare to allow for commercialization based on their low cost. In this study, we show that simple modification of one of the most well-known antifungal drugs, fluconazole, with organometallic moieties not only improves the activity of the parent drug but also broadens the scope of application of the new derivatives. These compounds were highly effective in vivo against pathogenic fungal infections and potent against parasitic worms such as Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally. Notably, the identified molecular targets indicate a mechanism of action that differs greatly from the parental antifungal drug, including targets involved in biosynthetic pathways that are absent in humans, offering great potential to expand our armamentarium against drug-resistant fungal infections and NTDs targeted for elimination by 2030. Overall, the discovery of these new compounds with broad-spectrum activity opens new avenues for the development of treatments for several current human infections, either caused by fungi or by parasites, including other NTDs, as well as newly emerging diseases.\nSperm Toolbox - A selection of small molecules to study human spermatozoa\nAuthors: Gruber, F. S.; Richardson, A.; Johnston, Z. C.; Myles, R.; Norcross, N.; Day, D.; Georgiou, I.; Sesma Sanz, L.; Wilson, C.; Read, K. D.; Martins da Silva, S.; Barratt, C. L.; Gilbert, I. H.; Swedlow, J. R.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.02.539126\nMale contraceptive options and infertility treatments are limited. To help overcome these limitations we established a small molecule library as a toolbox for assay development and screening campaigns using human spermatozoa. We have profiled all compounds in our automated high-throughput screening platform and provide the dataset, which allows direct side-by-side comparisons of compound effects and assays using live human spermatozoa.\nStructural and Biological Evaluations of a Non-Nucleoside STING Agonist Specific for Human STING-A230 Variants\nAuthors: Tang, Z.; Zhao, J.; Li, Y.; Tomer, S.; Selvaraju, M.; Tien, N.; Sun, D.; Johnson, D. K.; Zhen, A.; Li, P.; Wang, J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547363\nPreviously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STING-A230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STING-A230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 Angstrom resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2',3'-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compound's activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STING-A230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STING-A230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macrophages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.\nThe CB1 Negative Allosteric Modulator PSNCBAM-1 Reduces Ethanol Self-Administration via a Nonspecific Hypophagic Effect\nAuthors: Buechler, H. M.; Sumi, M.; Madhurathakam, I. M.; Donegan, C.; DiGiorgio, F.; Acosta, A.; Uribe, S.; Rahman, M. A.; Sorbello, A.; Fischer, B. D.; Keck, T. M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547272\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 15 million people in the United States. Current pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD are only modestly effective, necessitating the identification of new targets for medications development. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been a target of interest for the development of medications for substance use disorders and other compulsive disorders. However, CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have severe side effects that limit their clinical utility, including anxiety, depression, and suicide. Recent development of CB1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), including PSNCBAM-1, may provide an alternative mechanism of attenuating CB1 signaling with reduced side effects. PSNCBAM-1 has not yet been evaluated for effects in models of AUD. In this study, we investigated the effects of the CB1 NAM, PSNCBAM-1, in rodent models of AUD using adult male mice. PSNCBAM-1 dose-dependently attenuated oral ethanol self-administration (8% w/v ethanol in water), significantly reducing ethanol rewards at a dose of 30 mg/kg, but not at 10 or 18 mg/kg. PSNCBAM-1 also dose-dependently attenuated palatable food self-administration (diluted vanilla Ensure), significantly reducing food rewards at 18 and 30 mg/kg PSNCBAM-1. PSNCBAM-1 did not affect conditioned place preference for 2 g/kg ethanol. These results suggest PSNCBAM-1 reduces ethanol-taking behavior via a nonspecific hypophagic effect and does not reduce the rewarding effects of ethanol.\nToxicogenomic analysis of the carcinogenic potential of plastic additives\nAuthors: Vincoff, S.; Schleupner, B.; Santos, J.; Morrison, M.; Zhang, N.; Dunphy-Daly, M. M.; Eward, W. C.; Armstrong, A. J.; Diana, Z.; Somarelli, J.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547246\nPlastics are the most prevalent human-made substance in the world and are ubiquitous throughout all ecosystems. Microscopic plastic particles are routinely ingested and inhaled by humans and other organisms. Despite the frequency of plastic exposures, little is known about their health consequences. Of particular concern are plastic additives - chemical compounds that are mixed into plastics to improve functionality or are unintentionally acquired during plastic production and use. Additives are loosely bound to the plastic polymer and may be released during plastic exposures. These compounds may pose health concerns, such as cancer, but little is known about the potential impact of these chemicals on health. To better understand the health effects of plastic additives, we performed an integrated toxicogenomic analysis on 2,712 additives, focusing on cancer as a well-studied toxicological endpoint. Screening these substances across three chemical databases revealed two key observations: 1) over 150 plastic additives have known carcinogenicity and 2) the majority (~90%) of plastic additives lack data on carcinogenic endpoints. Analyses of additive usage patterns pinpointed specific polymers, functions, and products in which carcinogenic additives reside. Based on published chemical-gene interactions, both carcinogenic additives and additives with unknown carcinogenicity impacted similar biological pathways. The predominant pathways involved DNA damage, apoptosis, immune response, viral diseases, and cancer. This study underscores the urgent need for systematic and comprehensive carcinogenicity assessment of plastic additives and regulatory responses to mitigate the potential health risks of plastic exposure.\nLarvicidal activity of the photosensitive insecticides, methylene blue and rose bengal, in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes\nAuthors: Meier, C. J.; Hillyer, J. F.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547250\nBACKGROUND: Insecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules-here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs-that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTS: MB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti. CONCLUSION: MB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.\nSafety Assessment and Evaluation of Novel Thiourea Derivatives as Antivirals\nAuthors: Kumar, J.; Tyagi, P.; saini, a. k.; Sharma, D.; Kumar, V.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546447\nDSA-00 and its two derivatives (DSA-02 \u0026 DSA-09) are new thiourea derivatives that exhibit strong antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus comparable to Entecavir. Here these compounds were evaluated for in-vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and in vivo acute toxicity for their potential therapeutic use. The cytotoxicity of thiourea derivatives was assessed in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells by MTT assay whereas their genotoxicity was measured by Ames II test. The acute toxicity study was carried out in the Sprague-Dawley rats by observing the following parameters: mortality, clinical symptoms, hematological parameters, urine and changes in animal body \u0026 organs weight, gross necropsy and histopathology. DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 were non-cytotoxic even at the 320M concentration with respective CC50 values of 329.6, 323.5, and 349.7 M. The Ames II test revealed that these molecules were non-mutagenic at a [~]1M concentration. The acute toxicity studies revealed LD50 values belong from the moderate range of toxicity of DSA-00, DSA-02 and DSA-09. Importantly, there were no abnormal change in body weight and organs weight. Moreover, no abnormal clinical signs such as hematological parameter, urinalysis, gross necropsy and or histopathological in any of the animals after receiving oral doses of thiourea derivatives. Thiourea derivatives DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 appear to have a moderate range of acute toxicity at dosages used and thus, appear to be generally safe.

        <p class="abstract">Drug resistance observed with many anti-infectives clearly highlights the need for new broad-spectrum agents to treat especially neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) caused by eukaryotic parasitic pathogens including fungal infections. Since these diseases target the most vulnerable communities who are disadvantaged by health and socio-economic factors, new agents should be, if possible, easy-to-prepare to allow for commercialization based on their low cost. In this study, we show that simple modification of one of the most well-known antifungal drugs, fluconazole, with organometallic moieties not only improves the activity of the parent drug but also broadens the scope of application of the new derivatives. These compounds were highly effective in vivo against pathogenic fungal infections and potent against parasitic worms such as Brugia, which causes lymphatic filariasis and Trichuris, one of the soil-transmitted helminths that infects millions of people globally. Notably, the identified molecular targets indicate a mechanism of action that differs greatly from the parental antifungal drug, including targets involved in biosynthetic pathways that are absent in humans, offering great potential to expand our armamentarium against drug-resistant fungal infections and NTDs targeted for elimination by 2030. Overall, the discovery of these new compounds with broad-spectrum activity opens new avenues for the development of treatments for several current human infections, either caused by fungi or by parasites, including other NTDs, as well as newly emerging diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previously we identified a non-nucleotide tricyclic agonist BDW568 that activates human STING (stimulator of interferon genes) gene variant containing A230 in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). STING-A230 alleles, including HAQ and AQ, are less common STING variants in human population. To further characterize the mechanism of BDW568, we obtained the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of STING-A230 complexed with BDW-OH (active metabolite of BDW568) at 1.95 Angstrom resolution and found the planar tricyclic structure in BDW-OH dimerizes in the STING binding pocket and mimics the two nucleobases of the endogenous STING ligand 2&#39;,3&#39;-cGAMP. This binding mode also resembles a known synthetic ligand of human STING, MSA-2, but not another tricyclic mouse STING agonist DMXAA. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies revealed that all three heterocycles in BDW568 and the S-acetate side chain are critical for retaining the compound&#39;s activity. BDW568 could robustly activate the STING pathway in human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with STING-A230 genotype from healthy individuals. We also observed BDW568 could robustly activate type I interferon signaling in purified human primary macrophages that were transduced with lentivirus expressing STING-A230, suggesting its potential use to selectively activate genetically engineered macrophages in macrophage-based approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-macrophage immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 15 million people in the United States. Current pharmacotherapeutic treatments for AUD are only modestly effective, necessitating the identification of new targets for medications development. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) has been a target of interest for the development of medications for substance use disorders and other compulsive disorders. However, CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists (e.g., rimonabant) have severe side effects that limit their clinical utility, including anxiety, depression, and suicide. Recent development of CB1 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), including PSNCBAM-1, may provide an alternative mechanism of attenuating CB1 signaling with reduced side effects. PSNCBAM-1 has not yet been evaluated for effects in models of AUD. In this study, we investigated the effects of the CB1 NAM, PSNCBAM-1, in rodent models of AUD using adult male mice. PSNCBAM-1 dose-dependently attenuated oral ethanol self-administration (8% w/v ethanol in water), significantly reducing ethanol rewards at a dose of 30 mg/kg, but not at 10 or 18 mg/kg. PSNCBAM-1 also dose-dependently attenuated palatable food self-administration (diluted vanilla Ensure), significantly reducing food rewards at 18 and 30 mg/kg PSNCBAM-1. PSNCBAM-1 did not affect conditioned place preference for 2 g/kg ethanol. These results suggest PSNCBAM-1 reduces ethanol-taking behavior via a nonspecific hypophagic effect and does not reduce the rewarding effects of ethanol.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plastics are the most prevalent human-made substance in the world and are ubiquitous throughout all ecosystems. Microscopic plastic particles are routinely ingested and inhaled by humans and other organisms. Despite the frequency of plastic exposures, little is known about their health consequences. Of particular concern are plastic additives - chemical compounds that are mixed into plastics to improve functionality or are unintentionally acquired during plastic production and use. Additives are loosely bound to the plastic polymer and may be released during plastic exposures. These compounds may pose health concerns, such as cancer, but little is known about the potential impact of these chemicals on health. To better understand the health effects of plastic additives, we performed an integrated toxicogenomic analysis on 2,712 additives, focusing on cancer as a well-studied toxicological endpoint. Screening these substances across three chemical databases revealed two key observations: 1) over 150 plastic additives have known carcinogenicity and 2) the majority (~90%) of plastic additives lack data on carcinogenic endpoints. Analyses of additive usage patterns pinpointed specific polymers, functions, and products in which carcinogenic additives reside. Based on published chemical-gene interactions, both carcinogenic additives and additives with unknown carcinogenicity impacted similar biological pathways. The predominant pathways involved DNA damage, apoptosis, immune response, viral diseases, and cancer. This study underscores the urgent need for systematic and comprehensive carcinogenicity assessment of plastic additives and regulatory responses to mitigate the potential health risks of plastic exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Insecticides are critical for controlling mosquito populations and mitigating the spread of vector-borne disease, but their overuse has selected for resistant populations. A promising alternative to classical chemical insecticides is photosensitive molecules-here called photosensitive insecticides or PSIs-that when ingested and activated by light, generate broadly toxic reactive oxygen species. This mechanism of indiscriminate oxidative damage decreases the likelihood that target site modification-based resistance evolves. Here, we tested whether the PSIs, methylene blue (MB) and rose bengal (RB), are viable insecticides across the mosquito lineage. RESULTS: MB and RB are phototoxic to both Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae at micromolar concentrations, with greatest toxicity when larvae are incubated in the dark with the PSIs for 2 hr prior to photoactivation. MB is ten times more toxic than RB, and microscopy-based imaging suggests that this is because ingested MB escapes the larval gut and disperses throughout the hemocoel whereas RB remains confined to the gut. Adding food to the PSI-containing water has a bidirectional, concentration-dependent effect on PSI toxicity; toxicity increases at high concentrations but decreases at low concentrations. Finally, adding sand to the water increases the phototoxicity of RB to Aedes aegypti. CONCLUSION: MB and RB are larvicidal via a light activated mechanism, and therefore, should be further investigated as an option for mosquito control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DSA-00 and its two derivatives (DSA-02 &amp; DSA-09) are new thiourea derivatives that exhibit strong antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus comparable to Entecavir. Here these compounds were evaluated for in-vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and in vivo acute toxicity for their potential therapeutic use. The cytotoxicity of thiourea derivatives was assessed in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells by MTT assay whereas their genotoxicity was measured by Ames II test. The acute toxicity study was carried out in the Sprague-Dawley rats by observing the following parameters: mortality, clinical symptoms, hematological parameters, urine and changes in animal body &amp; organs weight, gross necropsy and histopathology. DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 were non-cytotoxic even at the 320M concentration with respective CC50 values of 329.6, 323.5, and 349.7 M. The Ames II test revealed that these molecules were non-mutagenic at a [~]1M concentration. The acute toxicity studies revealed LD50 values belong from the moderate range of toxicity of DSA-00, DSA-02 and DSA-09. Importantly, there were no abnormal change in body weight and organs weight. Moreover, no abnormal clinical signs such as hematological parameter, urinalysis, gross necropsy and or histopathological in any of the animals after receiving oral doses of thiourea derivatives. Thiourea derivatives DSA-00, DSA-02, and DSA-09 appear to have a moderate range of acute toxicity at dosages used and thus, appear to be generally safe.
