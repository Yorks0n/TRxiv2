While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, and especially to activate platelets acutely, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC. Approach and ResultsPASC patients and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under venous shear stress conditions. While only a mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was markedly decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under venous shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed using age- and sex-matched platelets from healthy individuals. ConclusionsPASC patients demonstrate dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating plasma-derived molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nCharacterization of cannabinoid plasma concentration, maternal health, and cytokine levels in a rat model of prenatal Cannabis smoke exposure\nAuthors: Black, T.; Baccetto, S. L.; Barnard, I. L.; Finch, E.; McElroy, D. L.; Austin-Scott, F. V.; Greba, Q.; Michel, D.; Zagzoog, A.; Howland, J. G.; Laprairie, R. B.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545309\nCannabis sativa has gained popularity as a \"natural substance\", leading many to falsely assume that it is not harmful. This assumption has been documented amongst pregnant mothers, many of whom consider Cannabis use during pregnancy as benign. The purpose of this study was to validate a Cannabis smoke exposure model in pregnant rats by determining the plasma levels of cannabinoids and associated metabolites in the dams after exposure to either Cannabis smoke or injected cannabinoids. Maternal and fetal cytokine and chemokine profiles were also assessed after exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated daily from gestational day 6 - 20 with either room air, i.p. vehicle, inhaled high-{Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (17.98% THC, 0.1% cannabidiol [CBD]) smoke, inhaled high-CBD (0.1% THC, 12.83% CBD) smoke, 3 mg/kg i.p. THC, or 10 mg/kg i.p. CBD. Our data reveal that THC and CBD, but not their metabolites, accumulate in maternal plasma after repeated exposures. Injection of THC or CBD was associated with fewer offspring and increased uterine reabsorption events. For cytokines and chemokines, injection of THC or CBD up-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to control or high-THC smoke or high-CBD smoke in placental and fetal brain tissue, whereas smoke exposure was generally associated with reduced cytokine and chemokine concentrations in placental and fetal brain tissue compared to controls. These results support existing, but limited, knowledge on how different routes of administration contribute to inconsistent manifestations of cannabinoid-mediated effects on pregnancy. Smoked Cannabis is still the most common means of human consumption, and more preclinical investigation is needed to determine the effects of smoke inhalation on developmental and behavioural trajectories.\nSystematic Characterization of LSD metabolites in C. elegans by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry\nAuthors: Silveira, C. M. d. V.; dos Santos, V. F.; Ornelas, I. M.; Carrilho, B. d. S.; Ventura, M. A. V. d. C.; Pereira, H. M. G.; Rehen, S. K.; Junqueira, M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545563\nPsychedelic compounds have gained renewed interest for their potential therapeutic applications, but their metabolism and effects on complex biological systems remain poorly understood. Here, we present a systematic characterization of LSD metabolites in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. By employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), we identified and quantified a range of LSD metabolites, shedding light on their metabolic pathways and offering insights into their pharmacokinetics. Our study demonstrates the suitability of C. elegans as a valuable model system for investigating the metabolism of psychedelic compounds and provides a foundation for further research on the therapeutic potential of LSD. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and highlight the importance of advanced analytical methodologies in elucidating the effects of psychedelic substances on biological systems.\nIdentification of Natural Antiviral Drug Candidates Against Tilapia Lake Virus: Computational Drug Design Approaches\nAuthors: Brown, C. L.; Sumon, M. A. A.; Asseri, A. H.; Molla, M. H. R.; Aljahdali, M. O.; Hasan, M. R.; Rahman, M. A.; Hasan, M. T.; Sumon, T. A.; Gabr, M. H.; Islam, M. S.; Fakhurji, B.; Moulay, M.; Larson, E.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545628\nTilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) is a disease that affects tilapia fish, causing a high rate of sudden death at any stage of their growth. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective antiviral drugs or vaccines to control the progression of this disease. Researchers have discovered that the CRM1 protein plays a critical function in the development and spreading of animal viruses. By inhibiting CRM1, the viruss spread in commercial fish farms can be suppressed. With this in mind, this study intended to identify potential antiviral drugs from two different tropical mangrove plants from tropical regions: Heritiera fomes and Ceriops candolleana. To identify promising compounds that target the CRM1 protein, a computer-aided drug discovery approach is employed containing molecular docking, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) analysis, toxicity assessment as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. To estimate binding affinities of all phytochemicals, molecular docking is used and the top three candidate compounds with the highest docking scores were selected, which are CID107876 (-8.3), CID12795736 (-8.2), and CID12303662 (-7.9). We also evaluated the ADME and toxicity properties of these compounds. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complex structures and confirm the suitability of these compounds. The computational study demonstrated that the phytochemicals found in H. fomes and C. candolleana could potentially serve as important inhibitors of TiLV, offering practical utility. However, further in vivo investigations are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of these compounds as antiviral drugs against the virus TiLV.\nDisposition and Toxicity of 2,2',5,5'-Tetrachlorobiphenyl in Female Rats Following Intraperitoneal Exposure\nAuthors: Bullert, A.; Li, X.; Zhang, C.; Lee, K.; Pulliam, C. F.; Klingelhutz, A. J.; Robertson, L. W.; Lehmler, H.-J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.544952\nThe disposition and toxicity of lower chlorinated PCBs (LC-PCBs) with less than five chlorine substituents have received little attention to date. This study characterizes the distribution of PCB 52, an LC-PCB found in indoor and outdoor air, three weeks after intraperitoneal exposure of female Sprague Dawley rats to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mg PCB 52/kg BW. PCB 52 exposure did not affect body or organ weights. PCB 52, measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), was detected in all tissue. Hydroxylated, sulfated, and methylated PCB metabolites, identified using GC-MS/MS and nontarget liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, were primarily found in the serum and liver of rats exposed to 100 mg/kg BW. Metabolomic analysis revealed minor effects on L-cysteine, glycine, cytosine, sphingosine, thymine, linoleic acid, orotic acid, L-histidine, and erythrose serum levels. Based on these results, PCB 52 toxicity studies need to account for its complex metabolism in vivo.

B.; Benayed, D. F.; Ruff, R. R.; Yildirim, G.; Dixit, M.; Schaffler, M. B.; Korstanje, R.; Robinson, L.; Miller, R. A.; Harrison, D.; Strong, R.; Yakar, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545146\nDeclines in mitochondrial content and impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) can result in reduced energy metabolism and increased levels of oxidants. Methylene blue (MB) is a well-established antioxidant that has been shown to improve mitochondrial function in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a selective antioxidant that specifically targets mitochondria and effectively reduces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. To investigate the effect of acute and long-term administration of MB on skeletal morphology, we administered MB to aged (18 months old) female C57BL/J6 mice, as well as to adult male and female mice with a genetically diverse background (UM-HET3). Additionally, we used MitoQ as an alternative approach to target mitochondrial oxidative stress during aging in adult female and male UM-HET3 mice. Although we observed some beneficial effects of MB and MitoQ in vitro, the administration of these compounds in vivo did not alter the progression of age-induced bone loss. Specifically, treating 18-month-old female mice with MB for 6 or 12 months did not have an effect on age-related bone loss. Similarly, long-term treatment with MB from 7 to 22 months or with MitoQ from 4 to 22 months of age did not affect the morphology of cortical bone at the mid-diaphysis of the femur, trabecular bone at the distal-metaphysis of the femur, or trabecular bone at the lumbar vertebra-5 (L5) in UM-HET3 mice. Based on our findings, it appears that long-term treatment with MB or MitoQ alone, as a means to reduce skeletal oxidative stress, is insufficient to inhibit age-associated bone loss. This supports the notion that interventions solely with antioxidants may not provide adequate protection against skeletal aging.\nTargeting lipid nanoparticles to the blood brain barrier to ameliorate acute ischemic stroke\nAuthors: Nong, J.; Glassman, P.

A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.544645\nAfter more than 100 failed drug trials for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), one of the most commonly cited reasons for the failure has been that drugs achieve very low concentrations in the at-risk penumbra. To address this problem, here we employ nanotechnology to significantly enhance drug concentration in the penumbras blood-brain barrier (BBB), whose increased permeability in AIS has long been hypothesized to kill neurons by exposing them to toxic plasma proteins. To devise drug-loaded nanocarriers targeted to the BBB, we conjugated them with antibodies that bind to various cell adhesion molecules on the BBB endothelium. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model, nanocarriers targeted with VCAM antibodies achieved the highest level of brain delivery, nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than untargeted ones. VCAM-targeted lipid nanoparticles loaded with either a small molecule drug (dexamethasone) or mRNA (encoding IL-10) reduced cerebral infarct volume by 35% or 73%, respectively, and both significantly lowered mortality rates. In contrast, the drugs delivered without the nanocarriers had no effect on AIS outcomes. Thus, VCAM-targeted lipid nanoparticles represent a new platform for strongly concentrating drugs within the compromised BBB of penumbra, thereby ameliorating AIS.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivePost-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, also referred as Long-COVID) sometimes follows COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 is well-known to promote a prothrombotic state, and especially to activate platelets acutely, less is known about the thrombosis risk in PASC.

Approach and ResultsPASC patients and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study on average 15 months after documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Platelet activation was evaluated by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTA) and flow cytometry in response to platelet surface receptor agonists. Thrombosis in platelet-deplete plasma was evaluated by Factor Xa activity. A microfluidics system assessed thrombosis in whole blood under venous shear stress conditions. While only a mild increase in platelet aggregation in PASC patients through the thromboxane receptor was observed platelet activation through the glycoprotein VI (GPVI) receptor was markedly decreased in PASC patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Thrombosis under venous shear conditions as well as Factor Xa activity were reduced in PASC patients. Plasma from PASC patients was an extremely potent activator of washed, healthy platelets - a phenomenon not observed using age- and sex-matched platelets from healthy individuals.

ConclusionsPASC patients demonstrate dysregulated responses in platelets and coagulation in plasma, likely caused by a circulating plasma-derived molecule that promotes thrombosis. A hitherto undescribed protective response appears to exists in PASC patients to counterbalance ongoing thrombosis that is common to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cannabis sativa has gained popularity as a &#34;natural substance&#34;, leading many to falsely assume that it is not harmful. This assumption has been documented amongst pregnant mothers, many of whom consider Cannabis use during pregnancy as benign. The purpose of this study was to validate a Cannabis smoke exposure model in pregnant rats by determining the plasma levels of cannabinoids and associated metabolites in the dams after exposure to either Cannabis smoke or injected cannabinoids. Maternal and fetal cytokine and chemokine profiles were also assessed after exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated daily from gestational day 6 - 20 with either room air, i.p. vehicle, inhaled high-{Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (17.98% THC, 0.1% cannabidiol [CBD]) smoke, inhaled high-CBD (0.1% THC, 12.83% CBD) smoke, 3 mg/kg i.p. THC, or 10 mg/kg i.p. CBD. Our data reveal that THC and CBD, but not their metabolites, accumulate in maternal plasma after repeated exposures. Injection of THC or CBD was associated with fewer offspring and increased uterine reabsorption events. For cytokines and chemokines, injection of THC or CBD up-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to control or high-THC smoke or high-CBD smoke in placental and fetal brain tissue, whereas smoke exposure was generally associated with reduced cytokine and chemokine concentrations in placental and fetal brain tissue compared to controls. These results support existing, but limited, knowledge on how different routes of administration contribute to inconsistent manifestations of cannabinoid-mediated effects on pregnancy. Smoked Cannabis is still the most common means of human consumption, and more preclinical investigation is needed to determine the effects of smoke inhalation on developmental and behavioural trajectories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic compounds have gained renewed interest for their potential therapeutic applications, but their metabolism and effects on complex biological systems remain poorly understood. Here, we present a systematic characterization of LSD metabolites in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. By employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS), we identified and quantified a range of LSD metabolites, shedding light on their metabolic pathways and offering insights into their pharmacokinetics. Our study demonstrates the suitability of C. elegans as a valuable model system for investigating the metabolism of psychedelic compounds and provides a foundation for further research on the therapeutic potential of LSD. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field and highlight the importance of advanced analytical methodologies in elucidating the effects of psychedelic substances on biological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tilapia Lake Virus (TiLV) is a disease that affects tilapia fish, causing a high rate of sudden death at any stage of their growth. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective antiviral drugs or vaccines to control the progression of this disease. Researchers have discovered that the CRM1 protein plays a critical function in the development and spreading of animal viruses. By inhibiting CRM1, the viruss spread in commercial fish farms can be suppressed. With this in mind, this study intended to identify potential antiviral drugs from two different tropical mangrove plants from tropical regions: Heritiera fomes and Ceriops candolleana. To identify promising compounds that target the CRM1 protein, a computer-aided drug discovery approach is employed containing molecular docking, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) analysis, toxicity assessment as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. To estimate binding affinities of all phytochemicals, molecular docking is used and the top three candidate compounds with the highest docking scores were selected, which are CID107876 (-8.3), CID12795736 (-8.2), and CID12303662 (-7.9). We also evaluated the ADME and toxicity properties of these compounds. Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complex structures and confirm the suitability of these compounds. The computational study demonstrated that the phytochemicals found in H. fomes and C. candolleana could potentially serve as important inhibitors of TiLV, offering practical utility. However, further in vivo investigations are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of these compounds as antiviral drugs against the virus TiLV.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The disposition and toxicity of lower chlorinated PCBs (LC-PCBs) with less than five chlorine substituents have received little attention to date. This study characterizes the distribution of PCB 52, an LC-PCB found in indoor and outdoor air, three weeks after intraperitoneal exposure of female Sprague Dawley rats to 0, 1, 10, or 100 mg PCB 52/kg BW. PCB 52 exposure did not affect body or organ weights. PCB 52, measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), was detected in all tissue. Hydroxylated, sulfated, and methylated PCB metabolites, identified using GC-MS/MS and nontarget liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, were primarily found in the serum and liver of rats exposed to 100 mg/kg BW. Metabolomic analysis revealed minor effects on L-cysteine, glycine, cytosine, sphingosine, thymine, linoleic acid, orotic acid, L-histidine, and erythrose serum levels. Based on these results, PCB 52 toxicity studies need to account for its complex metabolism in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">Declines in mitochondrial content and impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) can result in reduced energy metabolism and increased levels of oxidants. Methylene blue (MB) is a well-established antioxidant that has been shown to improve mitochondrial function in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a selective antioxidant that specifically targets mitochondria and effectively reduces the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells.

To investigate the effect of acute and long-term administration of MB on skeletal morphology, we administered MB to aged (18 months old) female C57BL/J6 mice, as well as to adult male and female mice with a genetically diverse background (UM-HET3). Additionally, we used MitoQ as an alternative approach to target mitochondrial oxidative stress during aging in adult female and male UM-HET3 mice.

Although we observed some beneficial effects of MB and MitoQ in vitro, the administration of these compounds in vivo did not alter the progression of age-induced bone loss. Specifically, treating 18-month-old female mice with MB for 6 or 12 months did not have an effect on age-related bone loss. Similarly, long-term treatment with MB from 7 to 22 months or with MitoQ from 4 to 22 months of age did not affect the morphology of cortical bone at the mid-diaphysis of the femur, trabecular bone at the distal-metaphysis of the femur, or trabecular bone at the lumbar vertebra-5 (L5) in UM-HET3 mice.

Based on our findings, it appears that long-term treatment with MB or MitoQ alone, as a means to reduce skeletal oxidative stress, is insufficient to inhibit age-associated bone loss. This supports the notion that interventions solely with antioxidants may not provide adequate protection against skeletal aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After more than 100 failed drug trials for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), one of the most commonly cited reasons for the failure has been that drugs achieve very low concentrations in the at-risk penumbra. To address this problem, here we employ nanotechnology to significantly enhance drug concentration in the penumbras blood-brain barrier (BBB), whose increased permeability in AIS has long been hypothesized to kill neurons by exposing them to toxic plasma proteins. To devise drug-loaded nanocarriers targeted to the BBB, we conjugated them with antibodies that bind to various cell adhesion molecules on the BBB endothelium. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model, nanocarriers targeted with VCAM antibodies achieved the highest level of brain delivery, nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than untargeted ones. VCAM-targeted lipid nanoparticles loaded with either a small molecule drug (dexamethasone) or mRNA (encoding IL-10) reduced cerebral infarct volume by 35% or 73%, respectively, and both significantly lowered mortality rates. In contrast, the drugs delivered without the nanocarriers had no effect on AIS outcomes. Thus, VCAM-targeted lipid nanoparticles represent a new platform for strongly concentrating drugs within the compromised BBB of penumbra, thereby ameliorating AIS.
