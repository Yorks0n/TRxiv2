Current barriers related to the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible use of space-flown pharmaceutical data have contributed to a lack of progress beyond application of earth-based principles. To directly tackle these challenges, we have produced a novel database of all the drugs flown into space, compiled from publicly available ontological and spaceflight-related datasets, to exemplify analyses for describing significant spaceflight-related targets. By focusing on mechanisms perturbed by spaceflight, we have provided a novel avenue for identifying the most relevant changes within the drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pathways. We suggest a set of space genes, by necessity limited to available tissue types, that can be expanded and modified based on future tissue-specific and mechanistic-specific high-throughput assays. In sum, we provide the justification and a definitive starting point for pharmacogenomics guided spaceflight as a foundation of precision medicine, which will enable long-term human habitation of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

D.; Hopkins, M.; Selvakumar, H.; Lin, K.-Y.; Chia, L.; Shen, C.-C.; Lioa, W.; Lee, P.; Yeh, T.; Suh, G.; Blankenberg, F. G.; Frymoyer, A.; Bollyky, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577154\nWith the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.\nLarge library docking for cannabinoid-1 receptor agonists with reduced side effects\nAuthors: Tummino, T. A.; Iliopoulos-Tsoutsouvas, C.; Braz, J. M.; O'Brien, E. S.; Stein, R. M.; Craik, V.; Tran, N. K.; Ganapathy, S.; Liu, F.; Shiimura, Y.; Tong, F.; Ho, T. C.; Radchenko, D. S.; Moroz, Y. S.; Rosado, S. R.; Bhardwaj, K.; Benitez, J.; Liu, Y.; Kandasamy, H.; Normand, C.; Semache, M.; Sabbagh, L.; Glenn, I.; Irwin, J. J.; Kumar, K. K.; Makriyannis, A.; Basbaum, A. I.; Shoichet, B. K.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.27.530254\nLarge library docking can reveal unexpected chemotypes that complement the structures of biological targets. Seeking new agonists for the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R), we docked 74 million tangible molecules, prioritizing 46 high ranking ones for de novo synthesis and testing. Nine were active by radioligand competition, a 20% hit-rate. Structure-based optimization of one of the most potent of these (Ki = 0.7 {micro}M) led to 4042, a 1.9 nM ligand and a full CB1R agonist. A cryo-EM structure of the purified enantiomer of 4042 ( 1350) in complex with CB1R-Gi1 confirmed its docked pose. The new agonist was strongly analgesic, with generally a 5-10-fold therapeutic window over sedation and catalepsy and no observable conditioned place preference. These findings suggest that new cannabinoid chemotypes may disentangle characteristic cannabinoid side-effects from their analgesia, supporting the further development of cannabinoids as pain therapeutics.\nSilver nanoparticles can be sampled by ultrafiltration probe but elution into \u0026 recovery from plasma and DPBS differs in vitro\nAuthors: risselada, m.; Mc Cain, R. R.; Bates, M. G.; Anderson, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577516\nWe compared 1) the influence of elution fluid on rate, pattern, and completeness of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) elution, and 2) ultrafiltration (UF) probe and direct sampling in vitro. Six specimens (2.5ml of 0.02mg/ml 10nm AgNP and 5.0ml of 30% poloxamer 407) contained in a dialysis tube (12-14kDa pores) were placed in 100ml Dulbeccos Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) (n=3) or canine plasma (n=3) for 96h on a stirred hot plate (37{degrees}C and 600rpm) and sampled 20 times. Six pipette and UF probe samples were taken of a 0.001mg AgNP/ml DPBS or plasma solution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to analyze Ag. Stock plasma contained Ag. At 96h, 5/6 dialysis tubes had not fully released AgNP. One peak in hourly Ag increase was present in DPBS (10-13h), and two peaks in plasma (6-8h and 10-13h). The hourly Ag increase in plasma decreased earlier than in DPBS. UF probe sampling was possible in both DPBS and plasma and resulted in higher Ag concentrations but with more variation than pipette samples. While in vitro use of DPBS might be more cost effective, plasma should be considered due to difference in elution and recovery.\nCreating cell-specific computational models of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes using optical experiments\nAuthors: Yang, J.; Daily, N.; Pullinger, T. K.; Wakatsuki, T.; Sobie, E. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574577\nHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help understand the ionic underpinnings of, and to simulate, various cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters. We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created simulated datasets by applying various protocols to a population of in silico cells with known conductance variations, and we fitted to those datasets. We found that calibrating models to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation held regardless of whether the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses. Author SummaryMany drug treatments or environmental factors can trigger cardiac arrhythmias, which are dangerous and often unpredictable. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor stem cells have proven to be a promising model for studying these events, but variability in donor genetic background and cell maturation methods, as well as overall immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes relative to the adult heart, have hindered reproducibility and reliability of these studies. Mathematical models of these cells can aid in understanding the underlying electrophysiological contributors to this variability, but determining these models parameters for multiple cell preparations is challenging. In this study, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational method to simultaneously estimate multiple model parameters using data from imaging-based experiments, which can be easily scaled to rapidly characterize multiple cell lines. This method can generate many personalized models of individual cell preparations, improving drug response predictions and revealing specific differences in electrophysiological properties that contribute to variability in cardiac maturity and arrhythmia susceptibility.

        <p class="abstract">With the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections, there is great interest in using lytic bacteriophages (phages) to treat such infections. However, the factors that govern bacteriophage pharmacokinetics in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we have examined the contribution of neutrophils, the most abundant phagocytes in the body, to the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered bacteriophage in uninfected mice. A single dose of LPS-5, an antipseudomonal bacteriophage recently used in human clinical trials, was administered intravenously to both wild-type BALB/c and neutropenic ICR mice. Phage concentrations were assessed in peripheral blood and spleen at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration by plaque assay and qPCR. We observed that the phage clearance is only minimally affected by neutropenia. Indeed, the half-life of phages in blood in BALB/c and ICR mice is 3.45 and 3.66 hours, respectively. These data suggest that neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis is not a major determinant of phage clearance. Conversely, we observed a substantial discrepancy in circulating phage levels over time when measured by qPCR versus plaque assay, suggesting that substantial functional inactivation of circulating phages occurs over time. These data indicate that circulating factors, but not neutrophils, inactivate intravenously administered phages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large library docking can reveal unexpected chemotypes that complement the structures of biological targets. Seeking new agonists for the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R), we docked 74 million tangible molecules, prioritizing 46 high ranking ones for de novo synthesis and testing. Nine were active by radioligand competition, a 20% hit-rate. Structure-based optimization of one of the most potent of these (Ki = 0.7 {micro}M) led to  4042, a 1.9 nM ligand and a full CB1R agonist. A cryo-EM structure of the purified enantiomer of  4042 ( 1350) in complex with CB1R-Gi1 confirmed its docked pose. The new agonist was strongly analgesic, with generally a 5-10-fold therapeutic window over sedation and catalepsy and no observable conditioned place preference. These findings suggest that new cannabinoid chemotypes may disentangle characteristic cannabinoid side-effects from their analgesia, supporting the further development of cannabinoids as pain therapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We compared 1) the influence of elution fluid on rate, pattern, and completeness of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) elution, and 2) ultrafiltration (UF) probe and direct sampling in vitro. Six specimens (2.5ml of 0.02mg/ml 10nm AgNP and 5.0ml of 30% poloxamer 407) contained in a dialysis tube (12-14kDa pores) were placed in 100ml Dulbeccos Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) (n=3) or canine plasma (n=3) for 96h on a stirred hot plate (37{degrees}C and 600rpm) and sampled 20 times. Six pipette and UF probe samples were taken of a 0.001mg AgNP/ml DPBS or plasma solution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to analyze Ag. Stock plasma contained Ag. At 96h, 5/6 dialysis tubes had not fully released AgNP. One peak in hourly Ag increase was present in DPBS (10-13h), and two peaks in plasma (6-8h and 10-13h). The hourly Ag increase in plasma decreased earlier than in DPBS. UF probe sampling was possible in both DPBS and plasma and resulted in higher Ag concentrations but with more variation than pipette samples. While in vitro use of DPBS might be more cost effective, plasma should be considered due to difference in elution and recovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have gained traction as a powerful model in cardiac disease and therapeutics research, since iPSCs are self-renewing and can be derived from healthy and diseased patients without invasive surgery. However, current iPSC-CM differentiation methods produce cardiomyocytes with immature, fetal-like electrophysiological phenotypes, and the variety of maturation protocols in the literature results in phenotypic differences between labs. Heterogeneity of iPSC donor genetic backgrounds contributes to additional phenotypic variability. Several mathematical models of iPSC-CM electrophysiology have been developed to help understand the ionic underpinnings of, and to simulate, various cell responses, but these models individually do not capture the phenotypic variability observed in iPSC-CMs. Here, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational pipeline to calibrate cell preparation-specific iPSC-CM electrophysiological parameters.

We used the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic parameter calibration method, to tune ion channel parameters in a mathematical model of iPSC-CM physiology. To systematically optimize an experimental protocol that generates sufficient data for parameter calibration, we created simulated datasets by applying various protocols to a population of in silico cells with known conductance variations, and we fitted to those datasets. We found that calibrating models to voltage and calcium transient data under 3 varied experimental conditions, including electrical pacing combined with ion channel blockade and changing buffer ion concentrations, improved model parameter estimates and model predictions of unseen channel block responses. This observation held regardless of whether the fitted data were normalized, suggesting that normalized fluorescence recordings, which are more accessible and higher throughput than patch clamp recordings, could sufficiently inform conductance parameters. Therefore, this computational pipeline can be applied to different iPSC-CM preparations to determine cell line-specific ion channel properties and understand the mechanisms behind variability in perturbation responses.

Author SummaryMany drug treatments or environmental factors can trigger cardiac arrhythmias, which are dangerous and often unpredictable. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor stem cells have proven to be a promising model for studying these events, but variability in donor genetic background and cell maturation methods, as well as overall immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes relative to the adult heart, have hindered reproducibility and reliability of these studies. Mathematical models of these cells can aid in understanding the underlying electrophysiological contributors to this variability, but determining these models parameters for multiple cell preparations is challenging. In this study, we tackle these limitations by developing a computational method to simultaneously estimate multiple model parameters using data from imaging-based experiments, which can be easily scaled to rapidly characterize multiple cell lines. This method can generate many personalized models of individual cell preparations, improving drug response predictions and revealing specific differences in electrophysiological properties that contribute to variability in cardiac maturity and arrhythmia susceptibility.
