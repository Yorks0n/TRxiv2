G.; Herbert, G.; Bhaskar, K.; McCormick, M.; Brigman, J.; Ottens, A.; Bleske, B.; Campen, M.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558863\nWildland fires have become progressively more extensive over the past 30 years in the US, and now routinely generate smoke that deteriorates air quality for most of the country. We explored the neurometabolomic impact that smoke derived from biomass has on older (18 months) female C57BL/6J mice, both acutely and after 10 weeks of recovery from exposures. Mice (N=6/group) were exposed to wood smoke (WS) 4 hours/day, every other day, for 2 weeks (7 exposures total) to an average concentration of 0.448mg/m3 per exposure. One group was euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure. Other groups were then placed on 1 of 4 treatment regimens for 10 weeks after wood smoke exposures: vehicle; resveratrol in chow plus nicotinamide mononucleotide in water (RNMN); senolytics via gavage (dasatanib+quercetin; DQ); or both RNMN with DQ (RNDQ). Among the findings, the aging from 18 months to 21 months was associated with the greatest metabolic shift, including changes in nicotinamide metabolism, with WS exposure effects that were relatively modest. WS caused a reduction in NAD+ within the prefrontal cortex immediately after exposure and a long-term reduction in serotonin that persisted for 10 weeks. The serotonin reductions were corroborated by forced swim tests, which revealed an increased immobility (reduction in motivation) immediately post-exposure and persisted for 10 weeks. RNMN had the most beneficial effects after WS exposure, while RNDQ caused markers of brain aging to be upregulated within WS-exposed mice. Findings highlight the persistent neurometabolomic and behavioral effects of woodsmoke exposure in an aged mouse model. Significance StatementNeurological impacts of wildfire smoke are largely underexplored but include neuroinflammation and metabolic changes. The present study highlights modulation of major metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and behavioral consequences in aged (18 month) female mice that persists 10 weeks after wood smoke exposure ended. Supplements derived from the anti-aging field were able to mitigate much of the woodsmoke effect, especially a combination of resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide.\nKetone supplementation dampens subjective and objective responses to alcohol in rats and humans\nAuthors: Li, X.; Shi, Z.; Todaro, D.; Pond, T.; Byanyima, J.; Vesslee, S.; Reddy, R.; Nanga, R. N. P. R.; Kass, G.; Ramchandani, V.; Kranzler, H.; Vendruscolo, J.; Vendruscolo, L.; Wiers, C. E.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.23.558269\nPrevious preclinical and human studies have shown that high-fat ketogenic diet and ketone supplements (KS) are efficacious in reducing alcohol craving, alcohol consumption, and signs of alcohol withdrawal. However, the effects of KS on alcohol sensitivity are unknown. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 10 healthy participants (3 females) were administered a single, oral dose of a KS (25 g of ketones from D-{beta}-hydroxybutyric acid and R-1,3-butanediol) or placebo 30 min prior to an oral alcohol dose (0.25 g/kg for women; 0.31 g/kg for men). Assessments of breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) and blood alcohol levels (BAL) and responses on the Drug Effect Questionnaire were repeatedly obtained over 180 min after alcohol consumption. In a parallel preclinical study, 8 Wistar rats (4 females) received an oral gavage of KS (0.42 g ketones/kg), water, or the sweetener allulose (0.58 g/kg) followed 15 min later by an oral alcohol dose (0.8 g/kg). BAL were monitored for 240 min after alcohol exposure. In humans, the intake of KS prior to alcohol significantly blunted BrAC and BAL, reduced ratings of alcohol liking and wanting, and increased disliking for alcohol. In rats, KS reduced BAL more than either allulose or water. In conclusion, KS altered physiological and subjective responses to alcohol in both humans and rats and the effects were likely not mediated by the sweetener allulose present in the KS drink. Therefore, KS could potentially reduce the intoxicating and rewarding effects of alcohol and thus be a novel intervention for treating alcohol use disorder.\nExploration of the Tunability of BRD4 Degradation by DCAF16 Trans-labelling Covalent Glues\nAuthors: Hassan, M. M.; Li, Y.-D.; Ma, M. W.; Teng, M.; Byun, W. S.; Puvar, K.; Lumpkin, R.; Sandoval, B.; Rutter, J. C.; Jin, C. Y.; Wang, M. Y.; Xu, S.; Schmoker, A. M.; Cheong, H.; Groendyke, B. J.; Qi, J.; Fischer, E. S.; Ebert, B. L.; Gray, N.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561308\nSmall molecules that can induce protein degradation by inducing proximity between a desired target and an E3 ligase have the potential to greatly expand the number of proteins that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Current strategies for targeted protein degradation are mostly limited in their target scope to proteins with preexisting ligands. Alternate modalities such as molecular glues, as exemplified by the glutarimide class of ligands for the CUL4CRBN ligase, have been mostly discovered serendipitously. We recently reported a trans-labelling covalent glue mechanism which we named Template-assisted covalent modification, where an electrophile decorated small molecule binder of BRD4 was effectively delivered to a cysteine residue on an E3 ligase DCAF16 as a consequence of a BRD4-DCAF16 protein-protein interaction. Herein, we report our medicinal chemistry efforts to evaluate how various electrophilic modifications to the BRD4 binder, JQ1, affect DCAF16 trans-labeling and subsequent BRD4 degradation efficiency. We discovered a decent correlation between the ability of the electrophilic small molecule to induce ternary complex formation between BRD4 and DCAF16 with its ability to induce BRD4 degradation. Moreover, we show that a more solvent-exposed warhead presentation is optimal for DCAF16 recruitment and subsequent BRD4 degradation. Unlike the sensitivity of CUL4CRBN glue degraders to chemical modifications, the diversity of covalent attachments in this class of BRD4 glue degraders suggests a high tolerance and tunability for the BRD4-DCAF16 interaction. This offers a potential new avenue for a rational design of covalent glue degraders by introducing covalent warheads to known binders.\nBeyond the nucleus: Plastic chemicals activate G protein-coupled receptors\nAuthors: McPartland, M.; Stevens, S.; Bartosova, Z.; Gisnaas Vardeberg, I.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560665\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central mediators of cell signaling and physiological function. Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.\nCheminformatics analysis of multi-target structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals binding to human endocrine receptors\nAuthors: Baskaran, S. P.; Sahoo, A. K.; Chivukula, N.; Kumar, K.; Samal, A.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561266\nIn human exposome, environmental chemicals can target, and disrupt different endocrine axes, ultimately leading to several endocrine disorders. Such chemicals, termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can promiscuously bind to different endocrine receptors and lead to varying biological endpoints. Thus, understanding the complexity in molecule-receptor binding of environmental chemicals can aid in the development of robust toxicity predictors. Towards this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multi-target structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting 8 human endocrine receptors, their activity values and biological endpoints from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through matched molecular pair (MMP) based approach, and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships, identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the 8 endocrine receptors. Overall, insights from this first study analyzing the structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals targeting multiple human endocrine receptors, will likely contribute towards the development of better toxicity prediction models for characterizing the human chemical exposome.\nTenofovir Activation is Diminished in the Brain and Liver of Creatine Kinase Brain-Type Knockout Mice\nAuthors: Eberhard, C. D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559370\nTenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

M.; La, V.; Franklin, C.; Aycock-Williams, A.; Fueger, P. T.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560917\nDespite the use of swine as a large animal translational surgical model, precise dosing regimens for commonly used analgesics such as buprenorphine, are currently lacking in this species. A newly available extended-release formulation of buprenorphine (XRB, Ethiqa) is FDA-indexed and approved for use in mice and rats; however, no studies have examined the efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters of XRB in swine. The goal of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the newly available XRB in swine. We hypothesized that after a single subcutaneous administration of XRB in adult swine, buprenorphine plasma concentrations would be at or above the therapeutic threshold of 0.1 ng/mL and that local injection side effects would be minimal. XRB was administered once, subcutaneously to two separate cohorts of adult female Yorkshire swine at low and high doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively; n = 3 and 2). Blood was collected from an indwelling jugular catheter prior to and after XRB administration (13 total time points). Individual animal data indicated all animals reached therapeutic buprenorphine plasma concentrations by 8 h post administration. Average plasma buprenorphine levels for both the low- and high-dose cohorts reached therapeutic concentrations starting at 1.5 h after XRB administration and were maintained above therapeutic concentrations throughout the 96-h study period. In the low-dose cohort, the average half-life was 212.6 {+/-} 107.1 h, whereas the half-lives in the high-dose cohort was 63.8 and 48.9 h. As expected, histology of XRB subcutaneous sites revealed mild injection site reactions characterized by granulomatous inflammation with intralesional cholesterol cleft formation. These results support our hypothesis and indicate that all animals maintained therapeutic plasma buprenorphine levels beginning at 8 h and maintaining past 96 h. Thus, XRB at either dose provide therapeutic levels of plasma buprenorphine and therefore its use should be further explored in swine.\nCharacterization of Gαs and Gαolf activation by catechol and non-catechol dopamine D1 receptor agonists\nAuthors: Nguyen, A. M.; Semeano, A.; Quach, V.; Inoue, A.; Nichols, D. E.; Yano, H.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560682\nThe dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nCurcumin and turmeric extract inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry and Spike mediated cell fusion\nAuthors: Septisetyani, E. P. P.; Lestari, D.; Paramitasari, K. A.; Prasetyaningrum, P. W.; Kastian, R. F.; Santoso, A.; Eriani, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.560070\nTurmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TEs impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 {micro}M and 10 {micro}M for curcumin and 1 {micro}g/ml and 10 {micro}g/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models.

These side effects arise when drugs affect untargeted tissues due to poor target specificity. In photopharmacology, light controls the timing and the location of drug delivery, improving treatment specificity and pharmacokinetic control. Photopharmaceuticals have not seen widespread adoption in part because researchers do not always have access to reliable and reproducible light delivery devices at prices which fit within the larger research budget. In this work, we present a customizable photomodulator for use in both wearable and implantable devices. For experimental validation of the photomodulator, we photolyse JF-NP-26 in rats, producing raseglurant, a mGluR5 inhibitor shown to have antinociceptive effects in animal models. We show our photomodulator produces a significant reduction in pain response in the formalin model by photoreleasing raseglurant, indicating our photomodulator can successfully drive in vivo photopharmacology. We demonstrate modifications which enable the photomodulator to operate wirelessly. By documenting our photomodulator development, we hope to introduce researchers to a simple solution which significantly lowers the engineering barriers to photopharmacology research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Wildland fires have become progressively more extensive over the past 30 years in the US, and now routinely generate smoke that deteriorates air quality for most of the country. We explored the neurometabolomic impact that smoke derived from biomass has on older (18 months) female C57BL/6J mice, both acutely and after 10 weeks of recovery from exposures. Mice (N=6/group) were exposed to wood smoke (WS) 4 hours/day, every other day, for 2 weeks (7 exposures total) to an average concentration of 0.448mg/m3 per exposure. One group was euthanized 24 hours after the last exposure. Other groups were then placed on 1 of 4 treatment regimens for 10 weeks after wood smoke exposures: vehicle; resveratrol in chow plus nicotinamide mononucleotide in water (RNMN); senolytics via gavage (dasatanib&#43;quercetin; DQ); or both RNMN with DQ (RNDQ). Among the findings, the aging from 18 months to 21 months was associated with the greatest metabolic shift, including changes in nicotinamide metabolism, with WS exposure effects that were relatively modest. WS caused a reduction in NAD&#43; within the prefrontal cortex immediately after exposure and a long-term reduction in serotonin that persisted for 10 weeks. The serotonin reductions were corroborated by forced swim tests, which revealed an increased immobility (reduction in motivation) immediately post-exposure and persisted for 10 weeks. RNMN had the most beneficial effects after WS exposure, while RNDQ caused markers of brain aging to be upregulated within WS-exposed mice. Findings highlight the persistent neurometabolomic and behavioral effects of woodsmoke exposure in an aged mouse model.

Significance StatementNeurological impacts of wildfire smoke are largely underexplored but include neuroinflammation and metabolic changes. The present study highlights modulation of major metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and behavioral consequences in aged (18 month) female mice that persists 10 weeks after wood smoke exposure ended. Supplements derived from the anti-aging field were able to mitigate much of the woodsmoke effect, especially a combination of resveratrol and nicotinamide mononucleotide.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Previous preclinical and human studies have shown that high-fat ketogenic diet and ketone supplements (KS) are efficacious in reducing alcohol craving, alcohol consumption, and signs of alcohol withdrawal. However, the effects of KS on alcohol sensitivity are unknown. In this single-blind, cross-over study, 10 healthy participants (3 females) were administered a single, oral dose of a KS (25 g of ketones from D-{beta}-hydroxybutyric acid and R-1,3-butanediol) or placebo 30 min prior to an oral alcohol dose (0.25 g/kg for women; 0.31 g/kg for men). Assessments of breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) and blood alcohol levels (BAL) and responses on the Drug Effect Questionnaire were repeatedly obtained over 180 min after alcohol consumption. In a parallel preclinical study, 8 Wistar rats (4 females) received an oral gavage of KS (0.42 g ketones/kg), water, or the sweetener allulose (0.58 g/kg) followed 15 min later by an oral alcohol dose (0.8 g/kg). BAL were monitored for 240 min after alcohol exposure. In humans, the intake of KS prior to alcohol significantly blunted BrAC and BAL, reduced ratings of alcohol liking and wanting, and increased disliking for alcohol. In rats, KS reduced BAL more than either allulose or water. In conclusion, KS altered physiological and subjective responses to alcohol in both humans and rats and the effects were likely not mediated by the sweetener allulose present in the KS drink. Therefore, KS could potentially reduce the intoxicating and rewarding effects of alcohol and thus be a novel intervention for treating alcohol use disorder.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small molecules that can induce protein degradation by inducing proximity between a desired target and an E3 ligase have the potential to greatly expand the number of proteins that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Current strategies for targeted protein degradation are mostly limited in their target scope to proteins with preexisting ligands. Alternate modalities such as molecular glues, as exemplified by the glutarimide class of ligands for the CUL4CRBN ligase, have been mostly discovered serendipitously. We recently reported a trans-labelling covalent glue mechanism which we named Template-assisted covalent modification, where an electrophile decorated small molecule binder of BRD4 was effectively delivered to a cysteine residue on an E3 ligase DCAF16 as a consequence of a BRD4-DCAF16 protein-protein interaction. Herein, we report our medicinal chemistry efforts to evaluate how various electrophilic modifications to the BRD4 binder, JQ1, affect DCAF16 trans-labeling and subsequent BRD4 degradation efficiency. We discovered a decent correlation between the ability of the electrophilic small molecule to induce ternary complex formation between BRD4 and DCAF16 with its ability to induce BRD4 degradation. Moreover, we show that a more solvent-exposed warhead presentation is optimal for DCAF16 recruitment and subsequent BRD4 degradation. Unlike the sensitivity of CUL4CRBN glue degraders to chemical modifications, the diversity of covalent attachments in this class of BRD4 glue degraders suggests a high tolerance and tunability for the BRD4-DCAF16 interaction. This offers a potential new avenue for a rational design of covalent glue degraders by introducing covalent warheads to known binders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are central mediators of cell signaling and physiological function. Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors are novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at Adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and Melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A) in a confirmatory secondary screen. We further confirmed that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. Our findings exemplify the diversity of endpoints plastic chemicals can target and demonstrate the relevance of non-genomic pathways which have thus far remained unexplored.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In human exposome, environmental chemicals can target, and disrupt different endocrine axes, ultimately leading to several endocrine disorders. Such chemicals, termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can promiscuously bind to different endocrine receptors and lead to varying biological endpoints. Thus, understanding the complexity in molecule-receptor binding of environmental chemicals can aid in the development of robust toxicity predictors. Towards this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multi-target structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting 8 human endocrine receptors, their activity values and biological endpoints from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through matched molecular pair (MMP) based approach, and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships, identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the 8 endocrine receptors. Overall, insights from this first study analyzing the structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals targeting multiple human endocrine receptors, will likely contribute towards the development of better toxicity prediction models for characterizing the human chemical exposome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

        <p class="abstract">Despite the use of swine as a large animal translational surgical model, precise dosing regimens for commonly used analgesics such as buprenorphine, are currently lacking in this species. A newly available extended-release formulation of buprenorphine (XRB, Ethiqa) is FDA-indexed and approved for use in mice and rats; however, no studies have examined the efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters of XRB in swine. The goal of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the newly available XRB in swine. We hypothesized that after a single subcutaneous administration of XRB in adult swine, buprenorphine plasma concentrations would be at or above the therapeutic threshold of 0.1 ng/mL and that local injection side effects would be minimal. XRB was administered once, subcutaneously to two separate cohorts of adult female Yorkshire swine at low and high doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively; n = 3 and 2). Blood was collected from an indwelling jugular catheter prior to and after XRB administration (13 total time points). Individual animal data indicated all animals reached therapeutic buprenorphine plasma concentrations by 8 h post administration. Average plasma buprenorphine levels for both the low- and high-dose cohorts reached therapeutic concentrations starting at 1.5 h after XRB administration and were maintained above therapeutic concentrations throughout the 96-h study period. In the low-dose cohort, the average half-life was 212.6 {&#43;/-} 107.1 h, whereas the half-lives in the high-dose cohort was 63.8 and 48.9 h. As expected, histology of XRB subcutaneous sites revealed mild injection site reactions characterized by granulomatous inflammation with intralesional cholesterol cleft formation. These results support our hypothesis and indicate that all animals maintained therapeutic plasma buprenorphine levels beginning at 8 h and maintaining past 96 h. Thus, XRB at either dose provide therapeutic levels of plasma buprenorphine and therefore its use should be further explored in swine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Turmeric extract (TE) with curcumin as its main active ingredient has been studied as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic. Curcumin has been studied in silico and in vitro against a naive SARS-CoV-2 virus, yet little is known about TEs impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, no study reveals the potentials of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we investigated the effects of both curcumin and TE on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell-to-cell transmission using pseudovirus (PSV) and syncytia models. We performed PSV entry assay in 293T or 293 cells expressing hACE2. The cells were pretreated with curcumin or TE, then treated with PSV with or without the test samples. Next, we carried out syncytia assay by co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids encoding Spike, hACE2, and TMPRSS2 to be treated with the test samples. The results showed that in PSV entry assay on 293T/hACE/TMPRSS2 cells, both curcumin and TE inhibited PSV entry at concentrations of 1 {micro}M and 10 {micro}M for curcumin and 1 {micro}g/ml and 10 {micro}g/ml for TE. Moreover, both curcumin and TE also reduced syncytia formation compared to control cells. Based on our study, both TE and curcumin are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection at entry points, either by direct or indirect infection models.

        <p class="abstract">Severe side effects prevent the utilization of otherwise promising drugs in treatments. These side effects arise when drugs affect untargeted tissues due to poor target specificity. In photopharmacology, light controls the timing and the location of drug delivery, improving treatment specificity and pharmacokinetic control. Photopharmaceuticals have not seen widespread adoption in part because researchers do not always have access to reliable and reproducible light delivery devices at prices which fit within the larger research budget. In this work, we present a customizable photomodulator for use in both wearable and implantable devices. For experimental validation of the photomodulator, we photolyse JF-NP-26 in rats, producing raseglurant, a mGluR5 inhibitor shown to have antinociceptive effects in animal models. We show our photomodulator produces a significant reduction in pain response in the formalin model by photoreleasing raseglurant, indicating our photomodulator can successfully drive in vivo photopharmacology. We demonstrate modifications which enable the photomodulator to operate wirelessly. By documenting our photomodulator development, we hope to introduce researchers to a simple solution which significantly lowers the engineering barriers to photopharmacology research.</p>
