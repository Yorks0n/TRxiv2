H.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549222\nActin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and a key component of the cytoskeleton. A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F-actin or monomeric G-actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth, respectively. Amongst these, the latrunculins, which bind to G-actin and affect polymerization, are widely used as tools to investigate actin-dependent cellular processes. Here, we report a photoswitchable version of latrunculin, termed opto-latrunculin (OptoLat), which binds to G-actin in a light-dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization. OptoLat can be activated with 390 - 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark. Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F-actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast, as shown by fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging. Light-activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected. Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia. Together, our data demonstrate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G-actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues.\nMultidrug Efflux in Gram-Negative Bacteria: Rationally Modifying Compounds to Avoid Efflux Pumps\nAuthors: Gurvic, D.; Zachariae, U.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548850\nGram-negative bacteria cause the majority of critically drug-resistant infections, necessitating the rapid development of new drugs with Gram-negative activity. However, drug design is hampered by the low permeability of the Gram-negative cell envelope and the function of drug efflux pumps, which extrude foreign molecules from the cell. A better understanding of the molecular determinants of compound recognition by efflux pumps is, therefore, essential. Here, we quantitatively analyse the activity of over 73,000 compounds across three strains of E. coli - the wild-type, an efflux-deficient variant, and a hyper-permeable variant - to elucidate the molecular principles of evading efflux pumps. Our results show that, alongside a range of physicochemical features, the presence or absence of specific chemical groups in the compounds substantially increases the probability of avoiding efflux. Furthermore, comparison of our findings with inward permeability data highlights the primary role of efflux in determining drug bioactivity in Gram-negative bacteria.\nMethanolic extracts of the edible halophyte Crithmum maritimum enhance oxidative stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans through hormetic mechanisms\nAuthors: MARTINS NOGUEROL, R.; Mata Cabana, A.; Olmedo, M.; DeAndres-Gil, C.; MOREIRA, X.; Francisco, M.; Moreno Perez, A. J.; CAMBROLLE, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549636\nHalophytes are promising sources of bioactive phenolic compounds for the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, their phenolic composition is influenced by environmental conditions, and the in vivo antioxidant activity of their phytochemicals is largely unknown. We evaluated the antioxidant capacity of phenolic-rich methanolic extracts from the edible halophyte Crithmum maritimum, grown in wild and greenhouse conditions. Additionally, their in vivo antioxidant capacity was analyzed for the first time using the model Caenorhabditis elegans. Wild plant extracts showed higher phenolic content and diversity, and in vitro antioxidant activity. Both extracts enhanced oxidative stress resistance and increased nematode survival rates, albeit to varying extents, and increased reactive oxygen species production in nematodes, without affecting their lifespan, suggesting a hormetic mechanism. Although no neuroprotective effects were observed in models of neurodegenerative diseases, these findings highlight the potential of C. maritimum as a valuable source of phenolics with antioxidant properties for the food industry.\nent-Verticilide B1 inhibits type 2 ryanodine receptor channels and is antiarrhythmic in Casq2-/- mice\nAuthors: Gochman, A.; Do, T. Q.; Kim, K.; Schwarz, J. A.; Thorpe, M. P.; Blackwell, D. J.; Smith, A. N.; Akers, W. S.; Cornea, R. L.; Laver, D. L.; Johnston, J. N.; Knollmann, B. C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547578\nCa2+ leak from cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an established mechanism of sudden cardiac death (SCD), whereby dysregulated Ca2+ handling causes ventricular arrhythmias. We previously discovered the RyR2-selective inhibitor ent-(+)-verticilide (ent-1), a 24-membered cyclooligomeric depsipeptide that is the enantiomeric form of a natural product (nat-(-)-verticilide). Here, we examined its 18-membered ring-size oligomer (ent-verticilide B1; \"ent-B1\") in single RyR2 channel assays, [3H]ryanodine binding assays, and in Casq2-/- cardiomyocytes and mice, a gene-targeted model of SCD. ent-B1 inhibited RyR2 single-channels and [3H]ryanodine binding with low micromolar potency, and RyR2-mediated spontaneous Ca release in Casq2-/-cardiomyocytes with sub-micromolar potency. Maximal inhibitory efficacy was less than 50% in all three assays. ent-B1 was stable in plasma, with a peak plasma concentration of 1460 ng/ml at 10 min and half-life of 45 min after intraperitoneal administration of 3 mg/kg in mice. Both 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg ent-B1 significantly reduced catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmia in Casq2-/-mice. Hence, we have identified a novel chemical entity - ent-B1 - that preserves the mechanism of action of a hit compound and shows therapeutic efficacy. These findings strengthen RyR2 as an antiarrhythmic drug target and highlight the potential of investigating the mirror-image isomers of natural products to discover new therapeutics. Significance statementThe cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an untapped target in the stagnant field of antiarrhythmic drug development. We have validated RyR2 as a target in a mouse model of sudden cardiac death and shown the therapeutic efficacy of a second enantiomeric natural product.\nPharmacological Evaluations of Select Herbal Extracts on TLR7/8-induced Cytokine and Chemokine Production in Macrophage-like Cells\nAuthors: Dagar, M.; Priya, K.; Dikshit, M.; Kumar, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549251\nInflammation is an innate immune response triggered by harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, tissue injury, or toxins. The purpose is to eliminate the source of infection and initiate the healing process. However, an excessive acute inflammatory response can lead to severe and life-threatening complications, as seen during recent pandemics. In the context of viral infections, the activation of the TLR7/8 signaling pathway has been implicated in excessive cytokine secretion. In this study, we aimed to replicate the perturbed inflammatory environment resulting from the activation of the TLR7/8 specific agonists, imiquimod, and resiquimod. We utilized macrophage-like cells, as macrophages are the first responders during infections and secrete key pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}) to recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Herbal medicines have been traditionally used for centuries to enhance respiratory immune function. In the present study, we employed a prophylactic approach, where macrophage-like THP1 cells, differentiated with PMA, were pre-treated with select herbal extracts/formulations prior to TLR7/8 activation in the presence of agonists. Several medicinal plants and formulations known for their therapeutic potential in respiratory ailments were investigated, including Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and AYUSH-64, an herbal formulation. The gene expression and corresponding secreted levels of various inflammatory mediators were measured using RT-PCR and ELISA methods, respectively, in treated and untreated differentiated THP1 cells induced with TLR7/8 agonists. Comparatively, the gene expression of inflammatory markers was significantly higher in resiquimod-induced cells than in imiquimod-treated cells. Notably, Withania somnifera demonstrated pronounced prophylactic efficacy compared to other herbs/formulations, as evidenced by reduction in expression of majority of investigated inflammatory marker genes.\n",

A better understanding of the molecular determinants of compound recognition by efflux pumps is, therefore, essential. Here, we quantitatively analyse the activity of over 73,000 compounds across three strains of E. coli - the wild-type, an efflux-deficient variant, and a hyper-permeable variant - to elucidate the molecular principles of evading efflux pumps. Our results show that, alongside a range of physicochemical features, the presence or absence of specific chemical groups in the compounds substantially increases the probability of avoiding efflux. Furthermore, comparison of our findings with inward permeability data highlights the primary role of efflux in determining drug bioactivity in Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Halophytes are promising sources of bioactive phenolic compounds for the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, their phenolic composition is influenced by environmental conditions, and the in vivo antioxidant activity of their phytochemicals is largely unknown. We evaluated the antioxidant capacity of phenolic-rich methanolic extracts from the edible halophyte Crithmum maritimum, grown in wild and greenhouse conditions. Additionally, their in vivo antioxidant capacity was analyzed for the first time using the model Caenorhabditis elegans. Wild plant extracts showed higher phenolic content and diversity, and in vitro antioxidant activity. Both extracts enhanced oxidative stress resistance and increased nematode survival rates, albeit to varying extents, and increased reactive oxygen species production in nematodes, without affecting their lifespan, suggesting a hormetic mechanism. Although no neuroprotective effects were observed in models of neurodegenerative diseases, these findings highlight the potential of C. maritimum as a valuable source of phenolics with antioxidant properties for the food industry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ca2&#43; leak from cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an established mechanism of sudden cardiac death (SCD), whereby dysregulated Ca2&#43; handling causes ventricular arrhythmias. We previously discovered the RyR2-selective inhibitor ent-(&#43;)-verticilide (ent-1), a 24-membered cyclooligomeric depsipeptide that is the enantiomeric form of a natural product (nat-(-)-verticilide). Here, we examined its 18-membered ring-size oligomer (ent-verticilide B1; &#34;ent-B1&#34;) in single RyR2 channel assays, [3H]ryanodine binding assays, and in Casq2-/- cardiomyocytes and mice, a gene-targeted model of SCD. ent-B1 inhibited RyR2 single-channels and [3H]ryanodine binding with low micromolar potency, and RyR2-mediated spontaneous Ca release in Casq2-/-cardiomyocytes with sub-micromolar potency. Maximal inhibitory efficacy was less than 50% in all three assays. ent-B1 was stable in plasma, with a peak plasma concentration of 1460 ng/ml at 10 min and half-life of 45 min after intraperitoneal administration of 3 mg/kg in mice. Both 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg ent-B1 significantly reduced catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmia in Casq2-/-mice. Hence, we have identified a novel chemical entity - ent-B1 - that preserves the mechanism of action of a hit compound and shows therapeutic efficacy. These findings strengthen RyR2 as an antiarrhythmic drug target and highlight the potential of investigating the mirror-image isomers of natural products to discover new therapeutics.

Significance statementThe cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is an untapped target in the stagnant field of antiarrhythmic drug development. We have validated RyR2 as a target in a mouse model of sudden cardiac death and shown the therapeutic efficacy of a second enantiomeric natural product.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inflammation is an innate immune response triggered by harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, tissue injury, or toxins. The purpose is to eliminate the source of infection and initiate the healing process. However, an excessive acute inflammatory response can lead to severe and life-threatening complications, as seen during recent pandemics. In the context of viral infections, the activation of the TLR7/8 signaling pathway has been implicated in excessive cytokine secretion. In this study, we aimed to replicate the perturbed inflammatory environment resulting from the activation of the TLR7/8 specific agonists, imiquimod, and resiquimod.

We utilized macrophage-like cells, as macrophages are the first responders during infections and secrete key pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}) to recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Herbal medicines have been traditionally used for centuries to enhance respiratory immune function. In the present study, we employed a prophylactic approach, where macrophage-like THP1 cells, differentiated with PMA, were pre-treated with select herbal extracts/formulations prior to TLR7/8 activation in the presence of agonists.

Several medicinal plants and formulations known for their therapeutic potential in respiratory ailments were investigated, including Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and AYUSH-64, an herbal formulation. The gene expression and corresponding secreted levels of various inflammatory mediators were measured using RT-PCR and ELISA methods, respectively, in treated and untreated differentiated THP1 cells induced with TLR7/8 agonists. Comparatively, the gene expression of inflammatory markers was significantly higher in resiquimod-induced cells than in imiquimod-treated cells. Notably, Withania somnifera demonstrated pronounced prophylactic efficacy compared to other herbs/formulations, as evidenced by reduction in expression of majority of investigated inflammatory marker genes.</p>
