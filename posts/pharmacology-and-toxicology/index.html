L.; Yang, S.; Wacker, D.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556555\nThe human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1, hTA1) is a key regulator of monoaminergic neurotransmission and the actions of psychostimulants. Despite preclinical research demonstrating its tractability as a drug target, its molecular mechanisms of activation remain unclear. Moreover, poorly understood pharmacological differences between rodent and human TA1 complicate the translation of findings from preclinical disease models into novel pharmacotherapies. To elucidate hTA1 mechanisms on the molecular scale and investigate the underpinnings of its divergent pharmacology from rodent orthologs, we herein report the structure of the human TA1 receptor in complex with a Gs heterotrimer. Our structure reveals shared structural elements with other TAARs, as well as with its closest monoaminergic ortholog, the serotonin receptor 5-HT4R. We further find that a single mutation dramatically shifts the selectivity of hTA1 towards that of its rodent orthologs, and report on the effects of substituting residues to those found in serotonin and dopamine receptors. Strikingly, we also discover that the atypical antipsychotic medication and pan-monoaminergic antagonist asenapine potently and efficaciously activates hTA1. Together our studies provide detailed insight into hTA1 structure and function, contrast its molecular pharmacology with that of related receptors, and uncover off-target activities of monoaminergic drugs at hTA1.\nMeisoindigo: An Effective Inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Revealed by Yeast System\nAuthors: Grabinski, W.; Kicinska, A.; Kosicka, E.; Baranek-Grabinska, M.; Hejenkowska, E. D.; Budzik, J.; Sliska, P.; Sliwinska, W.; Karachitos, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.555867\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARS- CoV-2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.\nIs the neuropeptide PEN a ligand of GPR83?\nAuthors: Giesecke, Y.; Asimi, V.; Stulberg, V.; Kleinau, G.; Scheerer, P.; Koksch, B.; Groetzinger, C.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555736\nG protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor with predominant expression in the cerebellum and proposed function in the regulation of food intake and in anxiety-like behavior. The neuropeptide PEN has been suggested as a specific GPR83 ligand. However, conflicting reports exist about whether PEN is indeed able to bind and activate GPR83. This study was initiated to evaluate PEN as a potential ligand of GPR83. Employing several second-messenger and other GPCR activation assays as well as a radioligand binding assay, and using multiple GPR83 plasmids and PEN peptides from different sources, no experimental evidence was found to support a role of PEN as a GPR83 ligand.\nNADPH oxidase 4-derived hydrogen peroxide counterbalances testosterone-induced endothelial dysfunction and migration\nAuthors: Alves, J. V.; Costa, R. M.; Awata, W. M.; Bruder-Nascimento, A.; Singh, S.; Tostes, R. C.; Bruder-Nascimento, T.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555550\nBackgroundHigh levels of testosterone (Testo) are associated with cardiovascular risk by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are the major source of ROS in the vasculature in cardiovascular diseases. NOX4 is a unique isotype, which produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and its participation in cardiovascular biology is controversial. So far, it is unclear whether NOX4 protects from Testo-induced endothelial injury. Thus, we hypothesized that supraphysiological levels of Testo induce endothelial NOX4 expression to attenuate endothelial injury. MethodsHuman Mesenteric Vascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were treated with Testo (10-7 M) with or without a NOX4 inhibitor [GLX351322 (10-4 M)]. In vivo, 10-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were treated with Testo (10 mg/kg) for 30 days to study endothelial function. ResultsTesto increased mRNA and protein levels of NOX4 in HMEC and HUVEC. Testo increased superoxide anion (O2-) and H2O2 production, which were abolished by NOX1 and NOX4 inhibition, respectively. Testo also attenuated bradykinin-induced NO production, which was further impaired by NOX4 inhibition. In vivo, Testo decreased H2O2 production in aortic segments and triggered endothelial dysfunction [decreased relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh)], which was further impaired by GLX351322 and by a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic (EUK134). Finally, Testo led to a dysregulated endothelial cells migration, which was exacerbated by GLX351322. ConclusionThese data indicate that supraphysiological levels of Testo increase the endothelial expression and activity of NOX4 to counterbalance the deleterious effects caused by Testo in endothelial function.\nPROTAC-mediated Degradation of HIV-1 Nef Efficiently Restores Cell-surface CD4 and MHC-I Expression and Blocks HIV-1 Replication\nAuthors: Emert-Sedlak, L. A.; Tice, C. M.; Shi, H.; Alvarado, J. J.; Shu, S. T.; Reitz, A. B.; Smithgall, T. E.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553289\nThe HIV-1 Nef accessory factor is critical to the viral life cycle in vivo where it promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells and viral persistence. While these features identify Nef as an attractive antiretroviral drug target, Nef lacks enzymatic activity and an active site, complicating development of occupancy-based drugs. Here we describe the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the targeted degradation of Nef. Nef-binding compounds, based on a previously reported hydroxypyrazole core, were coupled to ligands for ubiquitin E3 ligases via flexible linkers. The resulting bivalent PROTACs induced formation of a ternary complex between Nef and the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in ubiquitylation of Nef and proteolytic degradation. Nef-directed PROTACs efficiently rescued Nef-mediated MHC-I and CD4 downregulation in T cells and suppressed HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. Targeted degradation of Nef is anticipated to reverse all HIV-1 Nef functions and may help restore adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 reservoir cells in vivo.\nChlorpheniramine Maleate Displays Multiple Modes of Antiviral Action Against SARS-CoV- 2: A Mechanistic Study\nAuthors: Elshaier, Y. A. M. M.; Mostafa, A.; Valerio-Pascua, F.; Tesch, M. L.; Costin, J. M.; Rahaghi, F. F.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554806\nChlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM) has been identified as a potential antiviral compound against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of CPM on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including viral adsorption, replication inhibition, and virucidal activity. Our findings demonstrate that CPM exhibits antiviral properties by interfering with viral adsorption, replication, and directly inactivating the virus. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between CPM and essential viral proteins, such as the main protease receptor, spike protein receptor, and RNA polymerase. CPMs interactions were primarily hydrophobic in nature, with an additional hydrogen bond formation in the RNA polymerase active site. These results suggest that CPM has the potential to serve as a multitarget antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory viruses. Further investigations are warranted to explore its clinical implications and assess its efficacy in vivo.\nVascular injury associated with ethanol intake is driven by AT1 receptor and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nAuthors: Awata, W. M. C.; Alves, J. V.; Costa, R. M.; Bruder-Nascimento, A.; Singh, S.; Barbosa, G. S.; Tirapelli, C. R.; Nascimento, T. B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556341\nBackground: Renin angiotensin (Ang II) aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial for the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive ethanol consumption. Disturbs in mitochondria have been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, if mitochondria dysfunction contributes to ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated whether ethanol leads to vascular dysfunction via RAAS activation, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Methods: Male C57/BL6J or mt-keima mice (6 to 8-weeks old) were treated with ethanol (20% vol./vol.) for 12 weeks with or without Losartan (10 mg/kg). Results: Ethanol induced aortic hypercontractility in an endothelium-dependent manner. PGC1a; (a marker of biogenesis), Mfn2, (an essential protein for mitochondria fusion), as well as Pink-1 and Parkin (markers of mitophagy), were reduced in aortas from ethanol-treated mice. Disturb in mitophagy flux was further confirmed in arteries from mtkeima mice. Additionally, ethanol increased mtROS and reduced SOD2 expression. Strikingly, losartan prevented vascular hypercontractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and restored SOD2 expression. Both MnTMPyP (SOD2 mimetic) and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) reverted ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction. Moreover, L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) and EUK 134 (superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic) did not affect vascular response in ethanol group, suggesting that ethanol reduces aortic nitric oxide (NO) and H2O2 bioavailability. These responses were prevented by losartan. Conclusion: AT1 receptor modulates ethanol-induced vascular hypercontractility by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and reduction of NO and H2O2 bioavailability. Our findings shed a new light in our understanding of ethanol-induced vascular toxicity and open perspectives of new therapeutic approaches for patients with disorder associated with abusive ethanol drinking.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARS- CoV-2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor with predominant expression in the cerebellum and proposed function in the regulation of food intake and in anxiety-like behavior. The neuropeptide PEN has been suggested as a specific GPR83 ligand. However, conflicting reports exist about whether PEN is indeed able to bind and activate GPR83. This study was initiated to evaluate PEN as a potential ligand of GPR83. Employing several second-messenger and other GPCR activation assays as well as a radioligand binding assay, and using multiple GPR83 plasmids and PEN peptides from different sources, no experimental evidence was found to support a role of PEN as a GPR83 ligand.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHigh levels of testosterone (Testo) are associated with cardiovascular risk by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. NADPH oxidases (NOX) are the major source of ROS in the vasculature in cardiovascular diseases. NOX4 is a unique isotype, which produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and its participation in cardiovascular biology is controversial. So far, it is unclear whether NOX4 protects from Testo-induced endothelial injury. Thus, we hypothesized that supraphysiological levels of Testo induce endothelial NOX4 expression to attenuate endothelial injury.

MethodsHuman Mesenteric Vascular Endothelial Cells (HMEC) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were treated with Testo (10-7 M) with or without a NOX4 inhibitor [GLX351322 (10-4 M)]. In vivo, 10-week-old C57Bl/6J male mice were treated with Testo (10 mg/kg) for 30 days to study endothelial function.

ResultsTesto increased mRNA and protein levels of NOX4 in HMEC and HUVEC. Testo increased superoxide anion (O2-) and H2O2 production, which were abolished by NOX1 and NOX4 inhibition, respectively. Testo also attenuated bradykinin-induced NO production, which was further impaired by NOX4 inhibition. In vivo, Testo decreased H2O2 production in aortic segments and triggered endothelial dysfunction [decreased relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh)], which was further impaired by GLX351322 and by a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic (EUK134). Finally, Testo led to a dysregulated endothelial cells migration, which was exacerbated by GLX351322.

ConclusionThese data indicate that supraphysiological levels of Testo increase the endothelial expression and activity of NOX4 to counterbalance the deleterious effects caused by Testo in endothelial function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The HIV-1 Nef accessory factor is critical to the viral life cycle in vivo where it promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells and viral persistence. While these features identify Nef as an attractive antiretroviral drug target, Nef lacks enzymatic activity and an active site, complicating development of occupancy-based drugs. Here we describe the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) for the targeted degradation of Nef. Nef-binding compounds, based on a previously reported hydroxypyrazole core, were coupled to ligands for ubiquitin E3 ligases via flexible linkers. The resulting bivalent PROTACs induced formation of a ternary complex between Nef and the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in ubiquitylation of Nef and proteolytic degradation. Nef-directed PROTACs efficiently rescued Nef-mediated MHC-I and CD4 downregulation in T cells and suppressed HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. Targeted degradation of Nef is anticipated to reverse all HIV-1 Nef functions and may help restore adaptive immune responses against HIV-1 reservoir cells in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chlorpheniramine Maleate (CPM) has been identified as a potential antiviral compound against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of CPM on key stages of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including viral adsorption, replication inhibition, and virucidal activity. Our findings demonstrate that CPM exhibits antiviral properties by interfering with viral adsorption, replication, and directly inactivating the virus. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between CPM and essential viral proteins, such as the main protease receptor, spike protein receptor, and RNA polymerase. CPMs interactions were primarily hydrophobic in nature, with an additional hydrogen bond formation in the RNA polymerase active site. These results suggest that CPM has the potential to serve as a multitarget antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory viruses. Further investigations are warranted to explore its clinical implications and assess its efficacy in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Renin angiotensin (Ang II) aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial for the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive ethanol consumption. Disturbs in mitochondria have been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases. However, if mitochondria dysfunction contributes to ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction is still unknown. We investigated whether ethanol leads to vascular dysfunction via RAAS activation, mitochondria dysfunction, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Methods: Male C57/BL6J or mt-keima mice (6 to 8-weeks old) were treated with ethanol (20% vol./vol.) for 12 weeks with or without Losartan (10 mg/kg). Results: Ethanol induced aortic hypercontractility in an endothelium-dependent manner. PGC1a; (a marker of biogenesis), Mfn2, (an essential protein for mitochondria fusion), as well as Pink-1 and Parkin (markers of mitophagy), were reduced in aortas from ethanol-treated mice. Disturb in mitophagy flux was further confirmed in arteries from mtkeima mice. Additionally, ethanol increased mtROS and reduced SOD2 expression. Strikingly, losartan prevented vascular hypercontractility, mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and restored SOD2 expression. Both MnTMPyP (SOD2 mimetic) and CCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler) reverted ethanol-induced vascular dysfunction. Moreover, L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) and EUK 134 (superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic) did not affect vascular response in ethanol group, suggesting that ethanol reduces aortic nitric oxide (NO) and H2O2 bioavailability. These responses were prevented by losartan. Conclusion: AT1 receptor modulates ethanol-induced vascular hypercontractility by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS, and reduction of NO and H2O2 bioavailability. Our findings shed a new light in our understanding of ethanol-induced vascular toxicity and open perspectives of new therapeutic approaches for patients with disorder associated with abusive ethanol drinking.</p>
