Here, we tested unrefined AF2 models prospectively, comparing experimental hit-rates and affinities from large library docking against AF2 models vs the same screens targeting experimental structures of the same receptors. In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.\nAgonist efficacy at the B2AR is driven by agonist-induced differences in receptor affinity for the Gs protein, not ligand binding kinetics.\nAuthors: Harwood, C. R.; Sykes, D. A.; Redfern-Nichols, T.; Ladds, G.; Briddon, S. J.; Veprintsev, D.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574357\nIntroductionThe {beta}2-adrenoceptor ({beta}2AR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is therapeutically relevant in asthma, whereby {beta}2AR agonists relieve bronchoconstriction. The {beta}2AR is a prototypical GPCR for structural and biophysical studies. However, the molecular basis of agonist efficacy at the {beta}2AR is not understood. We hypothesized that the kinetics of ligand binding and GPCR-G protein interactions could play a role in ligand efficacy. We characterised the molecular pharmacology of a range of {beta}2AR agonists and examined the correlation between ligand and mini-Gs binding kinetics and efficacy. MethodsWe used a Time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) based competition ligand binding assay to measure the affinity and residence times of a range of {beta}2AR agonists binding to the human {beta}2AR. TR-FRET between Lumi4-Tb3+ on the N terminus of the {beta}2AR and fluorescent CA200693 (S)-propranolol-green was measured using a PHERAstar FSX. The ability of these {beta}2AR agonists to activate the heterotrimeric Gs protein was measured using the CASE Gs protein biosensor. This assay senses a reduction in NanoBRET between the nano-luciferase (nLuc) donor on the G subunit and Venus acceptor on the G{psi}, on receptor activation, quantified using the operational model of agonism. NanoBRET was also used to measure interactions between DDM solubilised {beta}2AR-nLuc and purified Venus-mini-Gs. A large excess of unlabelled mini-Gs was used to dissociate the {beta}2AR-nLuc: Venus-mini-Gs complex. ResultsCharacterisation of the molecular pharmacology of seven {beta}2AR agonists showed a broad range of ligand binding affinities (pKi = 4.4 {+/-} 0.09 to 9.2 {+/-} 0.08) and kinetics parameters. There was no correlation between ligand residence times and their ability (log{tau} ) to activate the Gs protein (R2=0.26, p=0.29). However, there were statistically significant differences in the association rate (kon (fast)) (3.36{+/-}0.64x105 to 9.19{+/-} 0.42x105) and affinity (Kd) values of mini-Gs binding to the agonist-{beta}2AR complex (pKd =6.0 to 6.7). Both an increase in ligand driven mini-Gs kon(fast) rate and associated increase in mini-Gs pKd for the receptor, were moderately correlated with efficacy (log{tau} ) (R2 =0.58 and R2 =0.50 respectively). ConclusionsThese data support a model in which agonists of increased efficacy cause the {beta}2AR to adopt a conformation that is more likely to recruit G protein. Conversely, these data did not support a role for agonist binding kinetics in the molecular basis of efficacy.\nAntibiotics affect the pharmacokinetics of n-butylphthalide in vivo by altering the intestinal microbiota\nAuthors: Li, X.; Guo, X.; Liu, Y.; Ren, F.; Li, S.; Yang, X.; Liu, J.; Zhang, Z.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575425\nObjective: N-butylphthalide (NBP) is a monomeric compound extracted from natural plant celery seeds, whether intestinal microbiota alteration can modify its pharmacokinetics is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intestinal microbiota alteration on the pharmacokinetics of NBP and its related mechanisms. Methods: After treatment with antibiotics and probiotics, plasma NBP concentrations in SD rats were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The effect of intestinal microbiota changes on NBP pharmacokinetics was compared. Intestinal microbiota changes after NBP treatment were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Expressions of CYP3A1 mRNA and protein in the liver and small intestine tissues under different intestinal flora conditions were determined by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. KEGG analysis was used to analyze the effect of intestinal microbiota changes on metabolic pathways. Results: Compared to the control group, the values of Cmax, AUC0-8, AUC0-{infty}, t1/2 in the antibiotic group increased by 56.1% (P\u003c0.001), 56.4% (P\u003c0.001), 53.2% (P\u003c0.001), and 24.4% (P\u003c0.05), respectively. In contrast, the CL and Tmax values decreased by 57.1% (P\u003c0.001) and 28.6% (P\u003c0.05), respectively. Treatment with antibiotics could reduce the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota. CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions in the small intestine of the antibiotic group were 61.2% and 66.1% of those of the control group, respectively. CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions in the liver were 44.6% and 63.9% of those in the control group, respectively. There was no significant change in the probiotic group. KEGG analysis showed that multiple metabolic pathways were significantly down-regulated in the antibiotic group. Among them, the pathways of drug metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis and decomposition, and fatty acid synthesis and decomposition were related to NBP biological metabolism. Conclusion: Antibiotic treatment could affect the intestinal microbiota, decrease CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions and increase NBP exposure in vivo by inhibiting pathways related to NBP metabolism.\nSynergistic Modulation of Macrophages by Methotrexate and RELA siRNA Folate-Liposome: A Precision Therapy to Prevent Joint Degradation in Collagen-Induced Arthritic Rats\nAuthors: Nasra, S.; Bhatia, D.; Kumar, A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574006\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe {beta}2-adrenoceptor ({beta}2AR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is therapeutically relevant in asthma, whereby {beta}2AR agonists relieve bronchoconstriction. The {beta}2AR is a prototypical GPCR for structural and biophysical studies. However, the molecular basis of agonist efficacy at the {beta}2AR is not understood. We hypothesized that the kinetics of ligand binding and GPCR-G protein interactions could play a role in ligand efficacy. We characterised the molecular pharmacology of a range of {beta}2AR agonists and examined the correlation between ligand and mini-Gs binding kinetics and efficacy.

MethodsWe used a Time-resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) based competition ligand binding assay to measure the affinity and residence times of a range of {beta}2AR agonists binding to the human {beta}2AR. TR-FRET between Lumi4-Tb3&#43; on the N terminus of the {beta}2AR and fluorescent CA200693 (S)-propranolol-green was measured using a PHERAstar FSX. The ability of these {beta}2AR agonists to activate the heterotrimeric Gs protein was measured using the CASE Gs protein biosensor. This assay senses a reduction in NanoBRET between the nano-luciferase (nLuc) donor on the G subunit and Venus acceptor on the G{psi}, on receptor activation, quantified using the operational model of agonism. NanoBRET was also used to measure interactions between DDM solubilised {beta}2AR-nLuc and purified Venus-mini-Gs. A large excess of unlabelled mini-Gs was used to dissociate the {beta}2AR-nLuc: Venus-mini-Gs complex.

ResultsCharacterisation of the molecular pharmacology of seven {beta}2AR agonists showed a broad range of ligand binding affinities (pKi = 4.4 {&#43;/-} 0.09 to 9.2 {&#43;/-} 0.08) and kinetics parameters. There was no correlation between ligand residence times and their ability (log{tau} ) to activate the Gs protein (R2=0.26, p=0.29). However, there were statistically significant differences in the association rate (kon (fast)) (3.36{&#43;/-}0.64x105 to 9.19{&#43;/-} 0.42x105) and affinity (Kd) values of mini-Gs binding to the agonist-{beta}2AR complex (pKd =6.0 to 6.7). Both an increase in ligand driven mini-Gs kon(fast) rate and associated increase in mini-Gs pKd for the receptor, were moderately correlated with efficacy (log{tau} ) (R2 =0.58 and R2 =0.50 respectively).

ConclusionsThese data support a model in which agonists of increased efficacy cause the {beta}2AR to adopt a conformation that is more likely to recruit G protein. Conversely, these data did not support a role for agonist binding kinetics in the molecular basis of efficacy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: N-butylphthalide (NBP) is a monomeric compound extracted from natural plant celery seeds, whether intestinal microbiota alteration can modify its pharmacokinetics is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of intestinal microbiota alteration on the pharmacokinetics of NBP and its related mechanisms. Methods: After treatment with antibiotics and probiotics, plasma NBP concentrations in SD rats were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The effect of intestinal microbiota changes on NBP pharmacokinetics was compared. Intestinal microbiota changes after NBP treatment were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Expressions of CYP3A1 mRNA and protein in the liver and small intestine tissues under different intestinal flora conditions were determined by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. KEGG analysis was used to analyze the effect of intestinal microbiota changes on metabolic pathways. Results: Compared to the control group, the values of Cmax, AUC0-8, AUC0-{infty}, t1/2 in the antibiotic group increased by 56.1% (P&lt;0.001), 56.4% (P&lt;0.001), 53.2% (P&lt;0.001), and 24.4% (P&lt;0.05), respectively. In contrast, the CL and Tmax values decreased by 57.1% (P&lt;0.001) and 28.6% (P&lt;0.05), respectively. Treatment with antibiotics could reduce the richness and diversity of the intestinal microbiota. CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions in the small intestine of the antibiotic group were 61.2% and 66.1% of those of the control group, respectively. CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions in the liver were 44.6% and 63.9% of those in the control group, respectively. There was no significant change in the probiotic group. KEGG analysis showed that multiple metabolic pathways were significantly down-regulated in the antibiotic group. Among them, the pathways of drug metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis and decomposition, and fatty acid synthesis and decomposition were related to NBP biological metabolism. Conclusion: Antibiotic treatment could affect the intestinal microbiota, decrease CYP3A1 mRNA and protein expressions and increase NBP exposure in vivo by inhibiting pathways related to NBP metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and joint destruction. Current treatments, such as Methotrexate (MTX), while effective, often have therapeutic limitations like high plasma Cmax and lack of sustained release. This study explores a synergistic approach to RA therapy using folate-liposomal co-delivery of MTX and RELA siRNA, aimed at RAW264.7 macrophage repolarization through inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Extensive invitro characterizations demonstrate the stability and biocompatibility of this combinatorial therapy in folate-liposomes. In collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, we observed a reduction in synovial inflammation and improved mobility following treatment. The combined MTX and RELA siRNA approach indirectly inhibits inflammatory cytokines and other biochemical parameters such as Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The targeted macrophage delivery yields a marked therapeutic effect in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, potentially modulating the M1 to M2 macrophage polarization. Overall, this research presents a promising avenue for innovative therapies in RA management by inhibiting the inflammatory cascade and preventing joint damage.</p>
