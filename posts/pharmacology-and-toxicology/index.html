L.; Gray, N.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561308\nSmall molecules that can induce protein degradation by inducing proximity between a desired target and an E3 ligase have the potential to greatly expand the number of proteins that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Current strategies for targeted protein degradation are mostly limited in their target scope to proteins with preexisting ligands. Alternate modalities such as molecular glues, as exemplified by the glutarimide class of ligands for the CUL4CRBN ligase, have been mostly discovered serendipitously. We recently reported a trans-labelling covalent glue mechanism which we named Template-assisted covalent modification, where an electrophile decorated small molecule binder of BRD4 was effectively delivered to a cysteine residue on an E3 ligase DCAF16 as a consequence of a BRD4-DCAF16 protein-protein interaction. Herein, we report our medicinal chemistry efforts to evaluate how various electrophilic modifications to the BRD4 binder, JQ1, affect DCAF16 trans-labeling and subsequent BRD4 degradation efficiency. We discovered a decent correlation between the ability of the electrophilic small molecule to induce ternary complex formation between BRD4 and DCAF16 with its ability to induce BRD4 degradation. Moreover, we show that a more solvent-exposed warhead presentation is optimal for DCAF16 recruitment and subsequent BRD4 degradation. Unlike the sensitivity of CUL4CRBN glue degraders to chemical modifications, the diversity of covalent attachments in this class of BRD4 glue degraders suggests a high tolerance and tunability for the BRD4-DCAF16 interaction. This offers a potential new avenue for a rational design of covalent glue degraders by introducing covalent warheads to known binders.\nHighly biased agonism for GPCR ligands via nanobody tethering\nAuthors: Sachdev, S.; Creemer, B. A.; Gardella, T. J.; Cheloha, R.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561766\nLigand-induced activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate signaling through multiple distinct pathways with differing biological and physiological outcomes. There is intense interest in understanding how variation in GPCR ligand structure can be used to promote pathway selective signaling (biased agonism) with the goal of promoting desirable responses and avoiding deleterious side effects. Here we present a new approach in which a conventional peptide ligand for the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) is converted from an agonist which induces signaling through all relevant pathways to a compound that is highly selective for a single pathway. This is achieved not through variation in the core structure of the agonist, but rather by linking it to a nanobody tethering agent that binds with high affinity to a separate site on the receptor not involved in signal transduction. The resulting conjugate represents the most biased agonist of PTHR1 reported to date. This approach holds promise for facile generation of pathway selective ligands for other GPCRs.\nCheminformatics analysis of multi-target structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals binding to human endocrine receptors\nAuthors: Baskaran, S. P.; Sahoo, A. K.; Chivukula, N.; Kumar, K.; Samal, A.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561266\nIn human exposome, environmental chemicals can target, and disrupt different endocrine axes, ultimately leading to several endocrine disorders. Such chemicals, termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can promiscuously bind to different endocrine receptors and lead to varying biological endpoints. Thus, understanding the complexity in molecule-receptor binding of environmental chemicals can aid in the development of robust toxicity predictors. Towards this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multi-target structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting 8 human endocrine receptors, their activity values and biological endpoints from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through matched molecular pair (MMP) based approach, and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships, identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the 8 endocrine receptors. Overall, insights from this first study analyzing the structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals targeting multiple human endocrine receptors, will likely contribute towards the development of better toxicity prediction models for characterizing the human chemical exposome.\nPharmacokinetics of Extended-release Buprenorphine (Ethiqa) in Female Yorkshire Swine (Sus scrofa domestica)\nAuthors: Stevey-Rindenow, L.; Saenz, M. M.; La, V.; Franklin, C.; Aycock-Williams, A.; Fueger, P. T.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560917\nDespite the use of swine as a large animal translational surgical model, precise dosing regimens for commonly used analgesics such as buprenorphine, are currently lacking in this species. A newly available extended-release formulation of buprenorphine (XRB, Ethiqa) is FDA-indexed and approved for use in mice and rats; however, no studies have examined the efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters of XRB in swine. The goal of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the newly available XRB in swine. We hypothesized that after a single subcutaneous administration of XRB in adult swine, buprenorphine plasma concentrations would be at or above the therapeutic threshold of 0.1 ng/mL and that local injection side effects would be minimal. XRB was administered once, subcutaneously to two separate cohorts of adult female Yorkshire swine at low and high doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively; n = 3 and 2). Blood was collected from an indwelling jugular catheter prior to and after XRB administration (13 total time points). Individual animal data indicated all animals reached therapeutic buprenorphine plasma concentrations by 8 h post administration. Average plasma buprenorphine levels for both the low- and high-dose cohorts reached therapeutic concentrations starting at 1.5 h after XRB administration and were maintained above therapeutic concentrations throughout the 96-h study period. In the low-dose cohort, the average half-life was 212.6 {+/-} 107.1 h, whereas the half-lives in the high-dose cohort was 63.8 and 48.9 h. As expected, histology of XRB subcutaneous sites revealed mild injection site reactions characterized by granulomatous inflammation with intralesional cholesterol cleft formation. These results support our hypothesis and indicate that all animals maintained therapeutic plasma buprenorphine levels beginning at 8 h and maintaining past 96 h. Thus, XRB at either dose provide therapeutic levels of plasma buprenorphine and therefore its use should be further explored in swine.\nCharacterization of Gαs and Gαolf activation by catechol and non-catechol dopamine D1 receptor agonists\nAuthors: Nguyen, A. M.; Semeano, A.; Quach, V.; Inoue, A.; Nichols, D. E.; Yano, H.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560682\nThe dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nAβ-affine bifunctional copper chelators capable of Aβ-induced oxidative stress reduction and amyloid disaggregation\nAuthors: Krasnovskaya, O.

S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561649\nAlz-5 acts as a bifunctional chelator that can interact with various Ab aggregates and reduce their neurotoxicity. Single-cell ROS measurements provided by Pt-nanoelectrode technique revealed a significant antioxidant properties of Alz-5 in Ab42 - affected SH-SY5Y cell. AFM data obtained on Ab42 fibrils clearly indicate an anti-aggregating property of Alz-5. Young modulus mapping on living SH-SY5Y cells revealed an ability of Alz-5 to decrease cell rigidity in Ab40-42 - affected SH-SY5Y cells.\nDesign of a low-cost photomodulator for in vivo photoactivation of a mGluR5 inhibitor\nAuthors: Ajieren, H.; Fox, A.; Biggs, E.; Albors, G.; Llebaria, A.; Irazoqui, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561310\nSevere side effects prevent the utilization of otherwise promising drugs in treatments. These side effects arise when drugs affect untargeted tissues due to poor target specificity. In photopharmacology, light controls the timing and the location of drug delivery, improving treatment specificity and pharmacokinetic control. Photopharmaceuticals have not seen widespread adoption in part because researchers do not always have access to reliable and reproducible light delivery devices at prices which fit within the larger research budget. In this work, we present a customizable photomodulator for use in both wearable and implantable devices. For experimental validation of the photomodulator, we photolyse JF-NP-26 in rats, producing raseglurant, a mGluR5 inhibitor shown to have antinociceptive effects in animal models. We show our photomodulator produces a significant reduction in pain response in the formalin model by photoreleasing raseglurant, indicating our photomodulator can successfully drive in vivo photopharmacology. We demonstrate modifications which enable the photomodulator to operate wirelessly. By documenting our photomodulator development, we hope to introduce researchers to a simple solution which significantly lowers the engineering barriers to photopharmacology research.\nTenofovir Activation is Diminished in the Brain and Liver of Creatine Kinase Brain-Type Knockout Mice\nAuthors: Eberhard, C. D.; Mosher, E. P.; Bumpus, N. N.; Orsburn, B. C.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559370\nTenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

S.; Voelker, J.; Wagner, M.\nScore: 35.3, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559713\nPlastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.

S.; Stove, S. I.; Butcher, M. L.; Lipina, T. V.; Ramsey, A. J.; Miller, G. W.; Salahpour, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561601\nVesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Small molecules that can induce protein degradation by inducing proximity between a desired target and an E3 ligase have the potential to greatly expand the number of proteins that can be manipulated pharmacologically. Current strategies for targeted protein degradation are mostly limited in their target scope to proteins with preexisting ligands. Alternate modalities such as molecular glues, as exemplified by the glutarimide class of ligands for the CUL4CRBN ligase, have been mostly discovered serendipitously. We recently reported a trans-labelling covalent glue mechanism which we named  Template-assisted covalent modification, where an electrophile decorated small molecule binder of BRD4 was effectively delivered to a cysteine residue on an E3 ligase DCAF16 as a consequence of a BRD4-DCAF16 protein-protein interaction. Herein, we report our medicinal chemistry efforts to evaluate how various electrophilic modifications to the BRD4 binder, JQ1, affect DCAF16 trans-labeling and subsequent BRD4 degradation efficiency. We discovered a decent correlation between the ability of the electrophilic small molecule to induce ternary complex formation between BRD4 and DCAF16 with its ability to induce BRD4 degradation. Moreover, we show that a more solvent-exposed warhead presentation is optimal for DCAF16 recruitment and subsequent BRD4 degradation. Unlike the sensitivity of CUL4CRBN glue degraders to chemical modifications, the diversity of covalent attachments in this class of BRD4 glue degraders suggests a high tolerance and tunability for the BRD4-DCAF16 interaction. This offers a potential new avenue for a rational design of covalent glue degraders by introducing covalent warheads to known binders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ligand-induced activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate signaling through multiple distinct pathways with differing biological and physiological outcomes. There is intense interest in understanding how variation in GPCR ligand structure can be used to promote pathway selective signaling (biased agonism) with the goal of promoting desirable responses and avoiding deleterious side effects. Here we present a new approach in which a conventional peptide ligand for the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) is converted from an agonist which induces signaling through all relevant pathways to a compound that is highly selective for a single pathway. This is achieved not through variation in the core structure of the agonist, but rather by linking it to a nanobody tethering agent that binds with high affinity to a separate site on the receptor not involved in signal transduction. The resulting conjugate represents the most biased agonist of PTHR1 reported to date. This approach holds promise for facile generation of pathway selective ligands for other GPCRs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In human exposome, environmental chemicals can target, and disrupt different endocrine axes, ultimately leading to several endocrine disorders. Such chemicals, termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can promiscuously bind to different endocrine receptors and lead to varying biological endpoints. Thus, understanding the complexity in molecule-receptor binding of environmental chemicals can aid in the development of robust toxicity predictors. Towards this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multi-target structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting 8 human endocrine receptors, their activity values and biological endpoints from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through matched molecular pair (MMP) based approach, and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships, identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the 8 endocrine receptors. Overall, insights from this first study analyzing the structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals targeting multiple human endocrine receptors, will likely contribute towards the development of better toxicity prediction models for characterizing the human chemical exposome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the use of swine as a large animal translational surgical model, precise dosing regimens for commonly used analgesics such as buprenorphine, are currently lacking in this species. A newly available extended-release formulation of buprenorphine (XRB, Ethiqa) is FDA-indexed and approved for use in mice and rats; however, no studies have examined the efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters of XRB in swine. The goal of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of the newly available XRB in swine. We hypothesized that after a single subcutaneous administration of XRB in adult swine, buprenorphine plasma concentrations would be at or above the therapeutic threshold of 0.1 ng/mL and that local injection side effects would be minimal. XRB was administered once, subcutaneously to two separate cohorts of adult female Yorkshire swine at low and high doses (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively; n = 3 and 2). Blood was collected from an indwelling jugular catheter prior to and after XRB administration (13 total time points). Individual animal data indicated all animals reached therapeutic buprenorphine plasma concentrations by 8 h post administration. Average plasma buprenorphine levels for both the low- and high-dose cohorts reached therapeutic concentrations starting at 1.5 h after XRB administration and were maintained above therapeutic concentrations throughout the 96-h study period. In the low-dose cohort, the average half-life was 212.6 {&#43;/-} 107.1 h, whereas the half-lives in the high-dose cohort was 63.8 and 48.9 h. As expected, histology of XRB subcutaneous sites revealed mild injection site reactions characterized by granulomatous inflammation with intralesional cholesterol cleft formation. These results support our hypothesis and indicate that all animals maintained therapeutic plasma buprenorphine levels beginning at 8 h and maintaining past 96 h. Thus, XRB at either dose provide therapeutic levels of plasma buprenorphine and therefore its use should be further explored in swine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) couples to Gs and Golf and plays a crucial role in regulating voluntary movement and other cognitive functions, making it a potential therapeutic target for several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinsons disease and schizophrenia. In the central nervous system, Gs is widely expressed in the cortex and Golf is predominantly found in the striatum. We used two different configurations of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays and a fluorescence-based cyclic AMP (cAMP) production functional assay to test a series of tetracyclic catechol (dihydrexidine, methyl-dihydrexidine, doxanthrine) and non-catechol (tavapadon, R03, R05) D1R agonists for their activity at these G proteins. We discovered that these tetracyclic catechol compounds and R03 exerted full agonism when D1R coupled to Gs but partial agonism when D1R coupled to Golf. In contrast, tavapadon acted as a full agonist at Golf and a partial agonist at Gs. The selectivity profiles of these compounds translated to their electrophysiological effects as expected. This suggested the possibility of achieving region-specific pharmacology and opened new directions for developing D1R drugs to treat relevant neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Severe side effects prevent the utilization of otherwise promising drugs in treatments. These side effects arise when drugs affect untargeted tissues due to poor target specificity. In photopharmacology, light controls the timing and the location of drug delivery, improving treatment specificity and pharmacokinetic control. Photopharmaceuticals have not seen widespread adoption in part because researchers do not always have access to reliable and reproducible light delivery devices at prices which fit within the larger research budget. In this work, we present a customizable photomodulator for use in both wearable and implantable devices. For experimental validation of the photomodulator, we photolyse JF-NP-26 in rats, producing raseglurant, a mGluR5 inhibitor shown to have antinociceptive effects in animal models. We show our photomodulator produces a significant reduction in pain response in the formalin model by photoreleasing raseglurant, indicating our photomodulator can successfully drive in vivo photopharmacology. We demonstrate modifications which enable the photomodulator to operate wirelessly. By documenting our photomodulator development, we hope to introduce researchers to a simple solution which significantly lowers the engineering barriers to photopharmacology research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor prescribed for the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Here, we demonstrate that creatine kinase brain-type (CKB) can form tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the pharmacologically active metabolite, in vitro, and identify nine missense mutations (C74S, R96P, S128R, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, R292Q, and H296R) that diminish this activity. Additional characterization of these mutations reveal that five (R96P, R132H, R236Q, C283S, and R292Q) have ATP dephosphorylation catalytic efficiencies less than 20% of wild-type (WT), and seven (C74S, R96P, R132H, R172P, R236Q, C283S, and H296P) induce thermal instabilities. To determine the extent CKB contributes to TFV activation in vivo, we generated a CKB knockout mouse strain, Ckbtm1Nnb. Using an in vitro assay, we show that brain lysates of Ckbtm1Nnb male and female mice form 70.5% and 77.4% less TFV-DP than wild-type brain lysates of the same sex, respectively. Additionally, we observe that Ckbtm1Nnb male mice treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 14 days exhibit a 22.8% reduction in TFV activation in liver compared to wild-type male mice. Lastly, we utilize mass spectrometry-based proteomics to elucidate the impact of the knockout on the abundance of nucleotide and small molecule kinases in the brain and liver, adding to our understanding of how loss of CKB may be impacting tenofovir activation in these tissues. Together, our data suggest that disruptions in CKB may lower levels of active drug in brain and liver.

        <p class="abstract">Plastics are complex chemical mixtures of polymers and various intentionally and non-intentionally added substances. Despite the well-established links between certain plastic chemicals (bisphenols, phthalates) and adverse health effects, the composition and toxicity of real-world mixtures of plastic chemicals is not well understood. To assess both, we analyzed the chemicals from 36 plastic food contact articles from five countries using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry and reporter gene assays for four nuclear receptors that represent key components of the endocrine and metabolic system. We found that chemicals activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}), estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) are prevalent in plastic packaging. We detected up to 9936 chemical features in a single product but found that each product has a rather unique chemical fingerprint. To tackle this chemical complexity, we used stepwise partial least squares regressions and prioritized and tentatively identified the chemical features associated with receptor activity. Our findings demonstrate that most plastic food packaging contains endocrine and metabolism disrupting chemicals. This shows that plastics are a relevant source of exposure to toxic chemicals and further supports the notion that plastic products designed for food contact cannot be considered safe.

        <p class="abstract">Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is an essential transporter that regulates brain monoamine transmission and is important for mood, cognition, motor activity, and stress regulation. However, VMAT2 remains underexplored as a pharmacological target. In this study, we report that tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants acutely inhibit, but persistently upregulate VMAT2 activity by promoting VMAT2 protein maturation. Importantly, the VMAT2 upregulation effect was greater in BE(2)-M17 cells that endogenously express VMAT2 as compared to a heterologous expression system (HEK293). The net sustained effect of tricyclics and tetracyclics is an upregulation of VMAT2 activity, despite their acute inhibitory effect. Furthermore, imipramine and mianserin, two representative compounds, also demonstrated rescue of nine VMAT2 variants that cause Brain Vesicular Monoamine Transport Disease (BVMTD). VMAT2 upregulation could be beneficial for disorders associated with reduced monoamine transmission, including mood disorders and BVMTD, a rare but often fatal condition caused by a lack of functional VMAT2. Our findings provide the first evidence that small molecules can upregulate VMAT2 and have potential therapeutic benefit for various neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
