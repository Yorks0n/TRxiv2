We present APOLLO, a resource of 247,092 human microbial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions spanning 19 phyla and accounting for microbial genomes from 34 countries, all age groups, and five body sites. We explored the metabolic potential of the reconstructed strains and developed a machine learning classifier able to predict with high accuracy the taxonomic strain assignments. We also built 14,451 sample-specific microbial community models, which could be stratified by body site, age, and disease states. Finally, we predicted faecal metabolites enriched or depleted in gut microbiomes of people with Crohns disease, Parkinson disease, and undernourished children. APOLLO is compatible with the human whole-body models, and thus, provide unprecedented opportunities for systems-level modelling of personalised host-microbiome co-metabolism. APOLLO will be freely available under https://www.vmh.life/.\nModelSEED v2: High-throughput genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction with enhanced energy biosynthesis pathway prediction\nAuthors: Faria, J. P.; Liu, F.; Edirisinghe, J. N.; Gupta, N.; Seaver, S. M. D.; Freiburger, A. P.; Zhang, Q.; Weisenhorn, P.; Conrad, N.; Zarecki, R.; Song, H.-S.; DeJongh, M.; Best, A. A.; Cottingham, R. W.; Arkin, A. P.; Henry, C. S.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.556561\nSince the release of ModelSEED in 2010, the systems biology research community has used the ModelSEED genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction pipeline to build over 200,000 draft metabolic reconstructions that support hundreds of publications. Here we describe the first comprehensive update to this reconstruction tool, with new features such as (i) a dramatically improved representation of energy metabolism, which ensures that models produce accurate amounts of ATP per mol of nutrient consumed; (ii) a new template for Archaea model reconstruction; and (iii) a significantly improved curation of all metabolic pathways with mappings to RAST subsystems annotations. We applied the improved pipeline to build and analyze core and genome-scale models for Archaea and Bacteria genomes in KEGG. The new ModelSEED pipeline generates larger models that possess more reactions and genes and require fewer gap-filled reactions. In addition, we see conserved patterns in the ATP biosynthesis mechanism across phylogeny, and identify clades where our understanding of energy biosynthesis is still poor. The ModelSEED v2 pipeline is currently available only as new reconstruction and gap-filling Apps in the KBase platform.\nThe fitness cost of spurious phosphorylation\nAuthors: Bradley, D.; Hogrebe, A.; Dandage, R.; Dube, A. K.; Leutert, M.; Dionne, U.; Chang, A.; Villen, J.; Landry, C. R.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.561337\nThe fidelity of signal transduction requires the binding of regulatory molecules to their cognate targets. However, the crowded cell interior risks off-target interactions between proteins that are functionally unrelated. How such off-target interactions impact fitness is not generally known, but quantifying this is required to understand the constraints faced by cell systems as they evolve. Here, we use the model organism S. cerevisiae to inducibly express tyrosine kinases. Because yeast lacks bona fide tyrosine kinases, most of the resulting tyrosine phosphorylation is spurious. This provides a suitable system to measure the impact of artificial protein interactions on fitness. We engineered 44 yeast strains each expressing a tyrosine kinase, and quantitatively analysed their phosphoproteomes. This analysis resulted in ~30,000 phosphosites mapping to ~3,500 proteins. Examination of the fitness costs in each strain revealed a strong correlation between the number of spurious pY sites and decreased growth. Moreover, the analysis of pY effects on protein structure and on protein function revealed over 1000 pY events that we predict to be deleterious. However, we also find that a large number of the spurious pY sites have a negligible effect on fitness, possibly because of their low stoichiometry. This result is consistent with our evolutionary analyses demonstrating a lack of phosphotyrosine counter-selection in species with bona fide tyrosine kinases. Taken together, our results suggest that, alongside the risk for toxicity, the cell can tolerate a large degree of non-functional crosstalk as interaction networks evolve.\nIntegrating microbial abundance time series with fermentation dynamics of the rumen microbiome via mathematical modelling\nAuthors: Davoudkhani, M.; Rubino, F.; Creevey, C. J.; Ahvenjarvi, S.; Bayat, A. R.; Tapio, I.; Belanche, A.; Munoz-Tamayo, R.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560454\nThe rumen represents a dynamic microbial ecosystem where fermentation metabolites and microbial concentrations change over time in response to dietary changes. The integration of microbial genomic knowledge and dynamic modelling can enhance our system-level understanding of rumen ecosystem's function. However, such an integration between dynamic models and rumen microbiota data is lacking. The objective of this work was to integrate rumen microbiota time series determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing into a dynamic modelling framework to link microbial data to the dynamics of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) production during fermentation. For that, we used the theory of state observers to develop a model that estimates the dynamics of VFA from the data of microbial functional proxies associated with the specific production of each VFA. We determined the microbial proxies using CowPi to infer the functional potential of the rumen microbiota and extrapolate their functional modules from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). The approach was challenged using data from an in vitro RUSITEC experiment and from an in vivo experiment with four cows. The model performance was evaluated by the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CRMSE). For the in vitro case study, the mean CVRMSE were 9.8% for acetate, 14% for butyrate and 14.5% for propionate. For the in vivo case study, the mean CVRMSE were 16.4% for acetate, 15.8% for butyrate and 19.8% for propionate. The mean CVRMSE for the VFA molar fractions were 3.1% for acetate, 3.8% for butyrate and 8.9% for propionate. Ours results show the promising application of state observers integrated with microbiota time series data for predicting rumen microbial metabolism.\nSpatial heterogeneity in tumor adhesion qualifies collective cell migration\nAuthors: Prasanna, C. V. S.; Jolly, M. K.; Bhat, R.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.559967\nCollective cell migration, a canon of most invasive solid tumors, is an emergent property of the interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, tumor populations invariably consist of cells expressing variable levels of adhesive proteins that mediate such interactions, disallowing an intuitive understanding of how tumor invasiveness at a multicellular scale is influenced by spatial heterogeneity of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion. Here, we have used a Cellular Potts model-based multiscale computational framework that is constructed on the histopathological principles of glandular cancers. In earlier efforts on homogenous cancer cell populations, this framework revealed the relative ranges of interactions, including cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion that drove collective, dispersed, and mixed multimodal migrations. Here, we constitute a tumor core of two separate cell subsets showing distinct intra-subset cell-cell or cell-ECM adhesion strengths. These two subsets of cells are arranged to varying extents of spatial intermingling, which we call the heterogeneity index (HI). Our simulations show that for a given two intra-subset cell-cell adhesions for two subsets of cells, low and high inter-subset cell adhesion favors migration of high HI and low HI intermingled populations, respectively. In addition, for the most explored values of cell-ECM adhesion strengths, populations with high HI values collectively migrate better than those with lower HI values. We then asked how spatial migration is regulated by progressively intermingled cellular subsets that were epithelial, i.e., showed high cell-cell but poor cell-ECM adhesion, and mesenchymal, i.e., with reversed adhesion strengths to the former. Here too, inter-subset adhesion plays an important role in contextualizing the proportionate relationship between HI and migration. We also observe an exception to this relationship for cases of heterogeneous cell-ECM adhesion where sub-maximal HI patterns with higher outer localization of cells with stronger ECM adhesion collectively migrate better than their relatively higher HI counterparts. Our simulations also reveal how adhesion heterogeneity qualifies migrative dynamics through collective cellular unjamming, when either cell-cell or -ECM adhesion type is varied but incorporates dispersion when both adhesion types are simultaneously altered.\nA new universal system of tree shape indices\nAuthors: Noble, R. J.; Verity, K.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549219\nThe comparison and categorization of tree diagrams is fundamental to large parts of biology, linguistics, computer science, and other fields, yet the indices currently applied to describing tree shape have important flaws that complicate their interpretation and limit their scope. Here we introduce a new system of indices with no such shortcomings. Our indices account for node sizes and branch lengths and are robust to small changes in either attribute. Unlike currently popular phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic entropy, and tree balance indices, our definitions assign interpretable values to all rooted trees and enable meaningful comparison of any pair of trees. Our self-consistent definitions further unite measures of diversity, richness, balance, symmetry, effective height, effective outdegree, and effective branch count in a coherent system, and we derive numerous simple relationships between these indices. The main practical advantages of our indices are in 1) quantifying diversity in non-ultrametric trees; 2) assessing the balance of trees that have non-uniform branch lengths or node sizes; 3) comparing the balance of trees with different leaf counts or outdegrees; 4) obtaining a coherent, generic, multidimensional quantification of tree shape that is robust to sampling error and inferential error. We illustrate these features by comparing the shapes of trees representing the evolution of HIV and of Uralic languages. Given the ubiquity of tree structures, we identify a wide range of applications across diverse domains.\nWidespread transcriptional regulation from within transcribed regions in plants\nAuthors: Voichek, Y.; Hristova, G.; Molla-Morales, A.; Weigel, D.; Nordborg, M.\nScore: 112.5, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557872\nAnimals and plants have evolved separately for over 1.5 billion years and independently invented multicellularity, suggesting a possible divergence in their mode of transcription regulation. Here, we set out to elucidate fundamental features of transcription regulatory sequences in plants. Using a massively parallel reporter assay in four species, we show that sequences downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) play a major role in controlling transcription. Swapping regulatory sequences from one side of the TSS to the other yields different outcomes, unlike animal enhancers which act independently of their position. A GATC-containing DNA motif, positioned downstream of the TSS, was sufficient to enhance gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Its effect on gene expression was tissue-dependent and conserved across vascular plants. These results identify a unique characteristic of transcriptional regulation in plants, and suggest fundamental differences in gene regulation might exist between plants and animals.\nPan-viral ORFs discovery using Massively Parallel Ribosome Profiling\nAuthors: Weingarten-Gabbay, S.; Bauer, M. R.; Stanton, A. C.; Klaeger, S.; Verzani, E. K.; Lopez, D.; Clauser, K. R.; Carr, S. A.; Abelin, J. G.; Rice, C. M.; Sabeti, P. C.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559641\nUnveiling the complete proteome of viruses is crucial to our understanding of the viral life cycle and interaction with the host. We developed Massively Parallel Ribosome Profiling (MPRP) to experimentally determine open reading frames (ORFs) in 20,170 designed oligonucleotides across 679 human-associated viral genomes. We identified 5,381 ORFs, including 4,208 non-canonical ORFs, and show successful detection of both annotated coding sequences (CDSs) and reported non-canonical ORFs. By examining immunopeptidome datasets of infected cells, we found class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) peptides originating from non-canonical ORFs identified through MPRP. By inspecting ribosome occupancies on the 5UTR and CDS regions of annotated viral genes, we identified hundreds of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that negatively regulate the synthesis of canonical viral proteins. The unprecedented source of viral ORFs across a wide range of viral families, including highly pathogenic viruses, expands the repertoire of vaccine targets and exposes new cis-regulatory sequences in viral genomes.\nComputational divergence analysis reveals the existence of regulatory degeneration and supports HDAC1 as a potential drug target for Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Wang, Q.; Zhao, Z.; Xu, H.; Lu, D.; Xia, J.; Zhang, W.; Meng, G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561015\nEpigenetic dysregulation has been widely reported in patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epigenetic drugs are gaining particular interest as a potential candidate therapy target. However, it is less clear how epigenetic dysregulation contributes to AD development. In this work, we performed regulatory divergence analysis using large-scale AD brain RNA-seq data and reported a widespread existence of regulatory degeneration among AD patients. It seems that transcription factor (TF)-mediated regulations get weakened or lost during AD development, resulting in disruption of normal neuronal function, especially including protein degradation, neuroinflammation, mitochondria and synaptic dysfunction. The regulatory degeneration burden (RDB) is well correlated with the detrimental clinical manifestations of AD patients. Studies of epigenetic marks, including histone modification, open chromatin accessibility and three TF binding sites supported the existence of regulatory degeneration. It suggested that epigenetic dysregulation contributed to regulatory degeneration, which also explained the consequence of epigenetic dysregulation. Among the epigenetic regulators, HDAC1 was proposed as a potential participator in such a process. Overall, our computational analysis suggested a novel causal mechanism of AD development and proposed HDAC1 as a drug target to treat AD.\nCompression of sickspan by interventions that steepen the survival curve\nAuthors: Yang, Y.; Mayo, A.; Levy, T.; Jarosz, D. F.; Alon, U.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560871\nLongevity research aims to enhance the period of healthy life, known as the healthspan, while minimizing the duration of disability and morbidity, known as the sickspan. Various interventions extend lifespan in model organisms, but it is not known which of these are likely to compress the relative sickspan. Here, we present a theory that predicts which interventions effectively compress the sickspan. The theory is based on the shape of the survival curve - the fraction of organisms surviving as a function of age. Interventions that lengthen mean lifespan while preserving the shape of the survival curve, known as scaling, are hypothesized to extend the sickspan proportionally, without compressing it. Such interventions include caloric restriction and most other known longevity interventions. Conversely, a small subset of interventions that extend lifespan and alter the shape of the survival curve, particularly by steepening it, are predicted to compress the sickspan. We provide intuitive explanations for this theory and demonstrate its origin from the saturated removal model, a recent mathematical aging model calibrated in mice. We discuss specific longevity interventions in mice that steepen the survival curves, including senolytics, ketogenic diet, and agents that reduce glucose spikes and protect blood vessels, as potential candidates for compressing the sickspan. This hypothesis offers insights into the potential strategies for achieving compressed morbidity and extending healthspan.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Computational modelling of microbiome metabolism has proved instrumental to catalyse our understanding of diet-host-microbiome-disease interactions through the interrogation of mechanistic, strain- and molecule-resolved metabolic models. We present APOLLO, a resource of 247,092 human microbial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions spanning 19 phyla and accounting for microbial genomes from 34 countries, all age groups, and five body sites. We explored the metabolic potential of the reconstructed strains and developed a machine learning classifier able to predict with high accuracy the taxonomic strain assignments. We also built 14,451 sample-specific microbial community models, which could be stratified by body site, age, and disease states. Finally, we predicted faecal metabolites enriched or depleted in gut microbiomes of people with Crohns disease, Parkinson disease, and undernourished children. APOLLO is compatible with the human whole-body models, and thus, provide unprecedented opportunities for systems-level modelling of personalised host-microbiome co-metabolism. APOLLO will be freely available under https://www.vmh.life/.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Since the release of ModelSEED in 2010, the systems biology research community has used the ModelSEED genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction pipeline to build over 200,000 draft metabolic reconstructions that support hundreds of publications. Here we describe the first comprehensive update to this reconstruction tool, with new features such as (i) a dramatically improved representation of energy metabolism, which ensures that models produce accurate amounts of ATP per mol of nutrient consumed; (ii) a new template for Archaea model reconstruction; and (iii) a significantly improved curation of all metabolic pathways with mappings to RAST subsystems annotations. We applied the improved pipeline to build and analyze core and genome-scale models for Archaea and Bacteria genomes in KEGG. The new ModelSEED pipeline generates larger models that possess more reactions and genes and require fewer gap-filled reactions. In addition, we see conserved patterns in the ATP biosynthesis mechanism across phylogeny, and identify clades where our understanding of energy biosynthesis is still poor. The ModelSEED v2 pipeline is currently available only as new reconstruction and gap-filling Apps in the KBase platform.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fidelity of signal transduction requires the binding of regulatory molecules to their cognate targets. However, the crowded cell interior risks off-target interactions between proteins that are functionally unrelated. How such off-target interactions impact fitness is not generally known, but quantifying this is required to understand the constraints faced by cell systems as they evolve. Here, we use the model organism S. cerevisiae to inducibly express tyrosine kinases. Because yeast lacks bona fide tyrosine kinases, most of the resulting tyrosine phosphorylation is spurious. This provides a suitable system to measure the impact of artificial protein interactions on fitness. We engineered 44 yeast strains each expressing a tyrosine kinase, and quantitatively analysed their phosphoproteomes. This analysis resulted in ~30,000 phosphosites mapping to ~3,500 proteins. Examination of the fitness costs in each strain revealed a strong correlation between the number of spurious pY sites and decreased growth. Moreover, the analysis of pY effects on protein structure and on protein function revealed over 1000 pY events that we predict to be deleterious. However, we also find that a large number of the spurious pY sites have a negligible effect on fitness, possibly because of their low stoichiometry. This result is consistent with our evolutionary analyses demonstrating a lack of phosphotyrosine counter-selection in species with bona fide tyrosine kinases. Taken together, our results suggest that, alongside the risk for toxicity, the cell can tolerate a large degree of non-functional crosstalk as interaction networks evolve.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rumen represents a dynamic microbial ecosystem where fermentation metabolites and microbial concentrations change over time in response to dietary changes. The integration of microbial genomic knowledge and dynamic modelling can enhance our system-level understanding of rumen ecosystem&#39;s function. However, such an integration between dynamic models and rumen microbiota data is lacking. The objective of this work was to integrate rumen microbiota time series determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing into a dynamic modelling framework to link microbial data to the dynamics of the volatile fatty acids (VFA) production during fermentation. For that, we used the theory of state observers to develop a model that estimates the dynamics of VFA from the data of microbial functional proxies associated with the specific production of each VFA. We determined the microbial proxies using CowPi to infer the functional potential of the rumen microbiota and extrapolate their functional modules from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). The approach was challenged using data from an in vitro RUSITEC experiment and from an in vivo experiment with four cows. The model performance was evaluated by the coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CRMSE). For the in vitro case study, the mean CVRMSE were 9.8% for acetate, 14% for butyrate and 14.5% for propionate. For the in vivo case study, the mean CVRMSE were 16.4% for acetate, 15.8% for butyrate and 19.8% for propionate. The mean CVRMSE for the VFA molar fractions were 3.1% for acetate, 3.8% for butyrate and 8.9% for propionate. Ours results show the promising application of state observers integrated with microbiota time series data for predicting rumen microbial metabolism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Collective cell migration, a canon of most invasive solid tumors, is an emergent property of the interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). However, tumor populations invariably consist of cells expressing variable levels of adhesive proteins that mediate such interactions, disallowing an intuitive understanding of how tumor invasiveness at a multicellular scale is influenced by spatial heterogeneity of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion. Here, we have used a Cellular Potts model-based multiscale computational framework that is constructed on the histopathological principles of glandular cancers. In earlier efforts on homogenous cancer cell populations, this framework revealed the relative ranges of interactions, including cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion that drove collective, dispersed, and mixed multimodal migrations. Here, we constitute a tumor core of two separate cell subsets showing distinct intra-subset cell-cell or cell-ECM adhesion strengths. These two subsets of cells are arranged to varying extents of spatial intermingling, which we call the heterogeneity index (HI). Our simulations show that for a given two intra-subset cell-cell adhesions for two subsets of cells, low and high inter-subset cell adhesion favors migration of high HI and low HI intermingled populations, respectively. In addition, for the most explored values of cell-ECM adhesion strengths, populations with high HI values collectively migrate better than those with lower HI values. We then asked how spatial migration is regulated by progressively intermingled cellular subsets that were epithelial, i.e., showed high cell-cell but poor cell-ECM adhesion, and mesenchymal, i.e., with reversed adhesion strengths to the former. Here too, inter-subset adhesion plays an important role in contextualizing the proportionate relationship between HI and migration. We also observe an exception to this relationship for cases of heterogeneous cell-ECM adhesion where sub-maximal HI patterns with higher outer localization of cells with stronger ECM adhesion collectively migrate better than their relatively higher HI counterparts. Our simulations also reveal how adhesion heterogeneity qualifies migrative dynamics through collective cellular unjamming, when either cell-cell or -ECM adhesion type is varied but incorporates dispersion when both adhesion types are simultaneously altered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The comparison and categorization of tree diagrams is fundamental to large parts of biology, linguistics, computer science, and other fields, yet the indices currently applied to describing tree shape have important flaws that complicate their interpretation and limit their scope. Here we introduce a new system of indices with no such shortcomings. Our indices account for node sizes and branch lengths and are robust to small changes in either attribute. Unlike currently popular phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic entropy, and tree balance indices, our definitions assign interpretable values to all rooted trees and enable meaningful comparison of any pair of trees. Our self-consistent definitions further unite measures of diversity, richness, balance, symmetry, effective height, effective outdegree, and effective branch count in a coherent system, and we derive numerous simple relationships between these indices. The main practical advantages of our indices are in 1) quantifying diversity in non-ultrametric trees; 2) assessing the balance of trees that have non-uniform branch lengths or node sizes; 3) comparing the balance of trees with different leaf counts or outdegrees; 4) obtaining a coherent, generic, multidimensional quantification of tree shape that is robust to sampling error and inferential error. We illustrate these features by comparing the shapes of trees representing the evolution of HIV and of Uralic languages. Given the ubiquity of tree structures, we identify a wide range of applications across diverse domains.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals and plants have evolved separately for over 1.5 billion years and independently invented multicellularity, suggesting a possible divergence in their mode of transcription regulation. Here, we set out to elucidate fundamental features of transcription regulatory sequences in plants. Using a massively parallel reporter assay in four species, we show that sequences downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) play a major role in controlling transcription. Swapping regulatory sequences from one side of the TSS to the other yields different outcomes, unlike animal enhancers which act independently of their position. A GATC-containing DNA motif, positioned downstream of the TSS, was sufficient to enhance gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Its effect on gene expression was tissue-dependent and conserved across vascular plants. These results identify a unique characteristic of transcriptional regulation in plants, and suggest fundamental differences in gene regulation might exist between plants and animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unveiling the complete proteome of viruses is crucial to our understanding of the viral life cycle and interaction with the host. We developed Massively Parallel Ribosome Profiling (MPRP) to experimentally determine open reading frames (ORFs) in 20,170 designed oligonucleotides across 679 human-associated viral genomes. We identified 5,381 ORFs, including 4,208 non-canonical ORFs, and show successful detection of both annotated coding sequences (CDSs) and reported non-canonical ORFs. By examining immunopeptidome datasets of infected cells, we found class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) peptides originating from non-canonical ORFs identified through MPRP. By inspecting ribosome occupancies on the 5UTR and CDS regions of annotated viral genes, we identified hundreds of upstream ORFs (uORFs) that negatively regulate the synthesis of canonical viral proteins. The unprecedented source of viral ORFs across a wide range of viral families, including highly pathogenic viruses, expands the repertoire of vaccine targets and exposes new cis-regulatory sequences in viral genomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epigenetic dysregulation has been widely reported in patients of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) and epigenetic drugs are gaining particular interest as a potential candidate therapy target. However, it is less clear how epigenetic dysregulation contributes to AD development. In this work, we performed regulatory divergence analysis using large-scale AD brain RNA-seq data and reported a widespread existence of regulatory degeneration among AD patients. It seems that transcription factor (TF)-mediated regulations get weakened or lost during AD development, resulting in disruption of normal neuronal function, especially including protein degradation, neuroinflammation, mitochondria and synaptic dysfunction. The regulatory degeneration burden (RDB) is well correlated with the detrimental clinical manifestations of AD patients. Studies of epigenetic marks, including histone modification, open chromatin accessibility and three TF binding sites supported the existence of regulatory degeneration. It suggested that epigenetic dysregulation contributed to regulatory degeneration, which also explained the consequence of epigenetic dysregulation. Among the epigenetic regulators, HDAC1 was proposed as a potential participator in such a process. Overall, our computational analysis suggested a novel causal mechanism of AD development and proposed HDAC1 as a drug target to treat AD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Longevity research aims to enhance the period of healthy life, known as the healthspan, while minimizing the duration of disability and morbidity, known as the sickspan. Various interventions extend lifespan in model organisms, but it is not known which of these are likely to compress the relative sickspan. Here, we present a theory that predicts which interventions effectively compress the sickspan. The theory is based on the shape of the survival curve - the fraction of organisms surviving as a function of age. Interventions that lengthen mean lifespan while preserving the shape of the survival curve, known as scaling, are hypothesized to extend the sickspan proportionally, without compressing it. Such interventions include caloric restriction and most other known longevity interventions. Conversely, a small subset of interventions that extend lifespan and alter the shape of the survival curve, particularly by steepening it, are predicted to compress the sickspan. We provide intuitive explanations for this theory and demonstrate its origin from the saturated removal model, a recent mathematical aging model calibrated in mice. We discuss specific longevity interventions in mice that steepen the survival curves, including senolytics, ketogenic diet, and agents that reduce glucose spikes and protect blood vessels, as potential candidates for compressing the sickspan. This hypothesis offers insights into the potential strategies for achieving compressed morbidity and extending healthspan.</p>
