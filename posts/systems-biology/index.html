In large protein families this task is particularly challenging because many off-target proteins have very similar structures. How this specificity of physical protein-protein interactions in cellular networks is encoded and evolves is not very well understood. Here we address the question of specificity-encoding by comprehensively quantifying the effects of all mutations in one protein, JUN, on its binding to all other members of a protein family, the 54 human basic leucine zipper transcription factors. Fitting a global thermodynamic model to the data reveals that most affinity changing mutations equally affect JUN's propensity to bind to all its interaction partners. Mutations that alter the specificity of binding are much rarer. These specificity-altering mutations are, however, distributed throughout the JUN interaction interface. JUN's interaction specificity is encoded by both positive determinants that promote on-target interactions and negative determinants that prevent off-target interactions. Indeed, about half of the specificity-defining residues in JUN have dual functions and both promote on-target binding and prevent off-target binding. Whereas nearly all mutations that alter specificity are pleiotropic and also alter the affinity of binding to all interaction partners, the converse is not true with mutations outside of the interface able to tune affinity without affecting specificity. Our results provide the first global view of how mutations in a protein affect binding to all its potential interaction partners and reveal the distributed encoding of specificity and affinity in an interaction interface. They also show how the modular architecture of coiled-coils provides an elegant solution to the challenge of optimising specificity and affinity in a large protein family.\nPerturbation-response analysis of in silico metabolic dynamics: Hard-coded responsiveness in the cofactor and network sparsity\nAuthors: Himeoka, Y.; Furusawa, C.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562862\nHomeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of Escherichia coli's central carbon metabolism. Our findings indicate that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations, wherein minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes-a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model, underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.\nA robust ultrasensitive transcriptional switch in noisy cellular environments\nAuthors: Jeong, E. M.; Kim, J. K.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553401\nUltrasensitive transcriptional switches enable sharp transitions between on and off states of transcription and are essential for cells to respond to environmental cues precisely. However, conventional switches, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, are extremely sensitive to noise. Here, we discovered an alternative design combining three indirect transcriptional repression mechanisms, sequestration, blocking, and displacement, to generate a noise-resilient ultrasensitive switch. Although sequestration alone can generate an ultrasensitive switch, it remains sensitive to noise because the unintended transcriptional state induced by noise can persist for long periods. However, by jointly utilizing blocking and displacement, these noise-induced transitions can be rapidly restored to the original transcriptional state. Because this transcriptional switch is effective in noisy cellular contexts, it goes beyond previous synthetic transcriptional switches utilizing direct repression mechanisms, making it particularly valuable for robust synthetic system design. Our findings also provide insights into the evolution of robust ultrasensitive switches in real cells. Specifically, the concurrent use of seemingly redundant indirect repression mechanisms in diverse biological systems appears to be a strategy to achieve noise-resilience of ultrasensitive switches.

Studies investigating molecular origins of noise have predominantly focused on the transcription process. However, the noise generated during the transcription process is further modulated by the translation process, which eventually determines the expression noise at the protein level. Studies across different organisms have revealed a positive correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. However, the molecular basis of this correlation has remained unknown. In this work, through stochastic modeling of translation in single mRNA molecules and empirical measurement of protein noise, we demonstrate that ribosome demand associated with high translational efficiency drives the correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. We also show that this correlation is present only in genes with bursty transcription, where ribosome demand varies with stochastic fluctuations in mRNA numbers. Thus, our work reveals how transcriptional bursts are translated into protein noise, which has important implications for investigating protein noise and phenotypic heterogeneity across biological systems.\nThe type of carbon source not the growth rate it supports can determine diauxie\nAuthors: Huo, Y.; Danecka, W.; Farquhar, I.; Mailliet, K.; Moses, T.; Wallace, E. W.; Swain, P. S.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562896\nHow cells choose between potential carbon sources is a classic example of cellular decision-making, and we know that many organisms prioritise glucose. Yet there has been little investigation of whether other sugars are also preferred, blinkering our view of carbon sensing. Here we study eukaryotic budding yeast and its growth on mixtures of palatinose, an isomer of sucrose, with other sugars. We find that yeast prioritise galactose over palatinose, but not sucrose or fructose, despite all three of these sugars being able to support faster growth than palatinose. Our results therefore disfavour carbon flux-sensing as the sole mechanism. By using genetic perturbations and transcriptomics, we show that repression is active and through Gal4, the master regulator of the GAL regulon. Cells enforce their preference for galactose over palatinose by preventing runaway positive feedback in the MAL regulon, whose genes enable palatinose catabolism. They do so both by repressing MAL11, the gene encoding the palatinose transporter, and by first expressing the isomaltases, IMA1 and IMA5, which cleave palatinose and so prevent its intracellular concentration becoming enough to induce further MAL expression. Our results demonstrate that budding yeast actively maintain a preference for carbon sources other than glucose and that such preferences have been selected by more than differences in growth rates. They imply that carbon-sensing strategies even in unicellular organisms are more complex than previously thought.\nNoise robustness and metabolic load determine the principles of central dogma regulation\nAuthors: Lo, T. W.; Choi, H. K. J.; Huang, D.; Wiggins, P. A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563172\nProtein expression levels optimize cell fitness: Too low of an expression level of essential proteins slows growth by compromising the function of essential processes, whereas the overexpression of proteins slows growth by increasing the metabolic load. This trade-off naively predicts that the cell maximizes its fitness by a Goldilocks principle in which cells express just enough protein for function; however, this strategy neglects the significance of the inherent stochasticity of the gene expression process which leads to significant cell-to-cell variation in protein numbers. How does the cell ensure robust growth in the face of the inherent stochasticity of these central dogma processes? To explore the consequences of noise in the expression of hundreds of essential genes, we build a minimal model where the trade-off between metabolic cost and growth robustness can be analyzed analytically. The model predicts that growth-rate maximization leads to a highly-asymmetric cost-benefit analysis which drives the optimal protein expression levels far above what is required on average, with low-expression essential proteins expressed at more than 10-fold what is required for growth in the typical cell. This robustness mechanism naturally explains the surprisingly strong buffering effect observed in essential protein depletion experiments and leads to a second qualitative prediction: there is a lower floor on the transcription level of essential genes corresponding to one message per cell cycle. We show that nearly all essential, but not non-essential, genes obey this limit in three evolutionarily-divergent model organisms: Escherichia coli, yeast, and human. The model also predicts that the optimal translation efficiency is roughly proportional to message abundance, predicting the observed relation between proteome fraction and message abundance in eukaryotic cells. This optimal translation efficiency predicts a non-canonical scaling of gene expression noise with protein abundance, which we show is observed in yeast. Together, these results reveal that noise robustness and metabolic load determine the global regulatory principles that govern central dogma function.\nMachine learning predicts system-wide metabolic flux control in cyanobacteria\nAuthors: Kugler, A.; Stensjö, K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562898\nMetabolic fluxes and their control mechanisms are fundamental in cellular metabolism, offering insights for the study of biological systems and biotechnological applications. However, quantitative and predictive understanding of controlling biochemical reactions in microbial cell factories, especially at the system level, is limited. In this work, we present ARCTICA, a computational framework that integrates constraint-based modelling with machine learning tools to address this challenge. Using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as chassis, we demonstrate that ARCTICA effectively simulates global-scale metabolic flux control. Key findings are that (i) the photosynthetic bioproduction is mainly governed by enzymes from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, rather than by those involve in the biosynthesis of the end-product, (ii) the catalytic capacity of the CBB cycle limits the photosynthetic activity and downstream pathways and (iii) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is a major, but not the most, limiting step in the CBB cycle. Predicted metabolic reactions qualitatively align with prior experimental observations, validating our modelling approach. ARCTICA serves as a valuable pipeline for understanding cellular physiology and predicting rate-limiting steps in genome-scale metabolic networks, providing guidance for bioengineering of cyanobacteria.\nModeling alternative translation initiation sites in plants reveals evolutionarily conserved cis-regulatory codes in eukaryotes\nAuthors: Wu, T.-Y.; Li, Y.-R.; Chang, K.-J.; Urano, D.; Liu, M.-J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563379\nmRNA translation relies on identifying translation initiation sites (TISs) in mRNAs. Alternative TISs are prevalent across plant transcriptomes, but the mechanisms for their recognition are unclear. Using ribosome profiling and machine learning, we developed models for predicting alternative TISs in Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Distinct feature sets were predictive of AUG and non-AUG TISs in 5' untranslated regions and coding sequences, including a novel CU-rich sequence that promoted plant TIS activity, a translational enhancer found across dicots and monocots and also in humans and viruses. Our results elucidate the mechanistic and evolutionary basis of TIS recognition, whereby cis-regulatory RNA signatures affect start site selection. The TIS prediction model provides global estimates of TISs to discover neglected protein-coding genes across plant genomes. The prevalence of cis-regulatory signatures across eukaryotes and viruses suggests their broad, critical roles in reprogramming the translational landscape in the plant-virus arms race.\nSystems-level analyses dissociate genetic regulators of reactive oxygen species and energy production\nAuthors: Bennett, N. K.; Lee, M.; Orr, A. L.; Nakamura, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562276\nRespiratory chain dysfunction can decrease ATP and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Despite the importance of these metabolic parameters to a wide range of cellular functions and disease, we lack an integrated understanding of how they are differentially regulated. To address this question, we adapted a CRISPRi- and FACS-based platform to compare the effects of respiratory gene knockdown on ROS to their effects on ATP. Focusing on genes whose knockdown is known to decrease mitochondria-derived ATP, we showed that knockdown of genes in specific respiratory chain complexes (I, III and CoQ10 biosynthesis) increased ROS, whereas knockdown of other low ATP hits either had no impact (mitochondrial ribosomal proteins) or actually decreased ROS (complex IV). Moreover, although shifting metabolic conditions profoundly altered mitochondria-derived ATP levels, it had little impact on mitochondrial or cytosolic ROS. In addition, knockdown of a subset of complex I subunits--including NDUFA8, NDUFB4, and NDUFS8--decreased complex I activity, mitochondria-derived ATP and supercomplex level, but knockdown of these genes had differential effects on ROS. Conversely, we found an essential role for ether lipids in the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial ROS levels independent of ATP. Thus, our results identify specific metabolic regulators of cellular ATP and ROS balance that may help dissect the roles of these processes in disease and identify therapeutic strategies to independently target energy failure and oxidative stress. SignificanceMitochondrial respiration generates both energy (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Insufficient energy and increased ROS from respiratory chain dysfunction may be central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and aging. We established a screening platform using CRISPR and fluorescent-cell sorting to compare the impact of decreasing respiratory chain proteins on ROS and ATP levels. The results provide the first systems-level analysis of how ROS and ATP are differentially regulated, and identify genes and respiratory chain complexes that can manipulate each independently. These findings advance our understanding of the relative contributions of ATP and ROS to disease pathophysiology, and guide the development of therapies to preserve energy while minimizing ROS.\nSmurfness-based two-phase model of ageing helps deconvolve the ageing transcriptional signature\nAuthors: Zane, F.; Bouzid, H.; Sosa Marmol, S.; Brazane, M.; Besse, S.; Molina, J.

By contrast, the Smurf assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing, that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state. We anticipate that increased attention to the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype will bring about significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing. Graphical abstract O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517330v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\"\u003e View larger version (35K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@37b39org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ef8f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@797299org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1529b0d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG The two-phase model of ageing allows to study separately the effect of chronological and physiological age. (A) Classic approaches for studying ageing tend to consider it as a black box affecting all individuals progressively from birth to death. Instead, the Smurf phenotype shows that life can be divided into two consecutive phases separated by an abrupt transition. (B) All individuals undergo this transition at a different moment in their life, prior to death. This allows us to switch from population based approaches, comparing bulks of age-matched individuals through time, to individuals-centred approaches relying on direct access to their transition status. (C) Such paradigm shift shows that hallmarks of ageing long thought to progressively change with age are actually mostly affected in a growing proportion of Smurfs, allowing for the identification of the chain of events accompanying ageing and death from natural causes. (D) By studying the behaviour of the ageing transcriptome as a function of chronological age and Smurfness separately, we demonstrate that the progressively changing transcriptional ageing signature, as described in Frenk \u0026 Houseley (2018), is in fact the convolution changes accompanying chronological age signature (increased transcriptional noise) and changes associated with Smurfness (or biological age) signature (increased stress response and inflammation, decreased expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes). We also identified a hallmark partially associated with only old Smurfs (ATH5), suggesting that chronological age can affect, late in life, the Smurf response. C_FIG\n",

        <p class="abstract">Proteins function in crowded cellular environments in which they must bind to specific target proteins but also avoid binding to many other off-target proteins. In large protein families this task is particularly challenging because many off-target proteins have very similar structures. How this specificity of physical protein-protein interactions in cellular networks is encoded and evolves is not very well understood. Here we address the question of specificity-encoding by comprehensively quantifying the effects of all mutations in one protein, JUN, on its binding to all other members of a protein family, the 54 human basic leucine zipper transcription factors. Fitting a global thermodynamic model to the data reveals that most affinity changing mutations equally affect JUN&#39;s propensity to bind to all its interaction partners. Mutations that alter the specificity of binding are much rarer. These specificity-altering mutations are, however, distributed throughout the JUN interaction interface. JUN&#39;s interaction specificity is encoded by both positive determinants that promote on-target interactions and negative determinants that prevent off-target interactions. Indeed, about half of the specificity-defining residues in JUN have dual functions and both promote on-target binding and prevent off-target binding. Whereas nearly all mutations that alter specificity are pleiotropic and also alter the affinity of binding to all interaction partners, the converse is not true with mutations outside of the interface able to tune affinity without affecting specificity. Our results provide the first global view of how mutations in a protein affect binding to all its potential interaction partners and reveal the distributed encoding of specificity and affinity in an interaction interface. They also show how the modular architecture of coiled-coils provides an elegant solution to the challenge of optimising specificity and affinity in a large protein family.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of Escherichia coli&#39;s central carbon metabolism. Our findings indicate that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations, wherein minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes-a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model, underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ultrasensitive transcriptional switches enable sharp transitions between on and off states of transcription and are essential for cells to respond to environmental cues precisely. However, conventional switches, relying on direct repressor-DNA binding, are extremely sensitive to noise. Here, we discovered an alternative design combining three indirect transcriptional repression mechanisms, sequestration, blocking, and displacement, to generate a noise-resilient ultrasensitive switch. Although sequestration alone can generate an ultrasensitive switch, it remains sensitive to noise because the unintended transcriptional state induced by noise can persist for long periods. However, by jointly utilizing blocking and displacement, these noise-induced transitions can be rapidly restored to the original transcriptional state. Because this transcriptional switch is effective in noisy cellular contexts, it goes beyond previous synthetic transcriptional switches utilizing direct repression mechanisms, making it particularly valuable for robust synthetic system design. Our findings also provide insights into the evolution of robust ultrasensitive switches in real cells. Specifically, the concurrent use of seemingly redundant indirect repression mechanisms in diverse biological systems appears to be a strategy to achieve noise-resilience of ultrasensitive switches.

        <p class="abstract">Stochastic variation in protein expression generates phenotypic heterogeneity in a cell population, and has important role in antibiotic persistence, mutation penetrance, cancer growth and therapy resistance. Studies investigating molecular origins of noise have predominantly focused on the transcription process. However, the noise generated during the transcription process is further modulated by the translation process, which eventually determines the expression noise at the protein level. Studies across different organisms have revealed a positive correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. However, the molecular basis of this correlation has remained unknown. In this work, through stochastic modeling of translation in single mRNA molecules and empirical measurement of protein noise, we demonstrate that ribosome demand associated with high translational efficiency drives the correlation between translational efficiency and protein noise. We also show that this correlation is present only in genes with bursty transcription, where ribosome demand varies with stochastic fluctuations in mRNA numbers. Thus, our work reveals how transcriptional bursts are translated into protein noise, which has important implications for investigating protein noise and phenotypic heterogeneity across biological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How cells choose between potential carbon sources is a classic example of cellular decision-making, and we know that many organisms prioritise glucose. Yet there has been little investigation of whether other sugars are also preferred, blinkering our view of carbon sensing. Here we study eukaryotic budding yeast and its growth on mixtures of palatinose, an isomer of sucrose, with other sugars. We find that yeast prioritise galactose over palatinose, but not sucrose or fructose, despite all three of these sugars being able to support faster growth than palatinose. Our results therefore disfavour carbon flux-sensing as the sole mechanism. By using genetic perturbations and transcriptomics, we show that repression is active and through Gal4, the master regulator of the GAL regulon. Cells enforce their preference for galactose over palatinose by preventing runaway positive feedback in the MAL regulon, whose genes enable palatinose catabolism. They do so both by repressing MAL11, the gene encoding the palatinose transporter, and by first expressing the isomaltases, IMA1 and IMA5, which cleave palatinose and so prevent its intracellular concentration becoming enough to induce further MAL expression. Our results demonstrate that budding yeast actively maintain a preference for carbon sources other than glucose and that such preferences have been selected by more than differences in growth rates. They imply that carbon-sensing strategies even in unicellular organisms are more complex than previously thought.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein expression levels optimize cell fitness: Too low of an expression level of essential proteins slows growth by compromising the function of essential processes, whereas the overexpression of proteins slows growth by increasing the metabolic load. This trade-off naively predicts that the cell maximizes its fitness by a Goldilocks principle in which cells express just enough protein for function; however, this strategy neglects the significance of the inherent stochasticity of the gene expression process which leads to significant cell-to-cell variation in protein numbers. How does the cell ensure robust growth in the face of the inherent stochasticity of these central dogma processes? To explore the consequences of noise in the expression of hundreds of essential genes, we build a minimal model where the trade-off between metabolic cost and growth robustness can be analyzed analytically. The model predicts that growth-rate maximization leads to a highly-asymmetric cost-benefit analysis which drives the optimal protein expression levels far above what is required on average, with low-expression essential proteins expressed at more than 10-fold what is required for growth in the typical cell. This robustness mechanism naturally explains the surprisingly strong buffering effect observed in essential protein depletion experiments and leads to a second qualitative prediction: there is a lower floor on the transcription level of essential genes corresponding to one message per cell cycle. We show that nearly all essential, but not non-essential, genes obey this limit in three evolutionarily-divergent model organisms: Escherichia coli, yeast, and human. The model also predicts that the optimal translation efficiency is roughly proportional to message abundance, predicting the observed relation between proteome fraction and message abundance in eukaryotic cells. This optimal translation efficiency predicts a non-canonical scaling of gene expression noise with protein abundance, which we show is observed in yeast. Together, these results reveal that noise robustness and metabolic load determine the global regulatory principles that govern central dogma function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolic fluxes and their control mechanisms are fundamental in cellular metabolism, offering insights for the study of biological systems and biotechnological applications. However, quantitative and predictive understanding of controlling biochemical reactions in microbial cell factories, especially at the system level, is limited. In this work, we present ARCTICA, a computational framework that integrates constraint-based modelling with machine learning tools to address this challenge. Using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as chassis, we demonstrate that ARCTICA effectively simulates global-scale metabolic flux control. Key findings are that (i) the photosynthetic bioproduction is mainly governed by enzymes from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, rather than by those involve in the biosynthesis of the end-product, (ii) the catalytic capacity of the CBB cycle limits the photosynthetic activity and downstream pathways and (iii) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is a major, but not the most, limiting step in the CBB cycle. Predicted metabolic reactions qualitatively align with prior experimental observations, validating our modelling approach. ARCTICA serves as a valuable pipeline for understanding cellular physiology and predicting rate-limiting steps in genome-scale metabolic networks, providing guidance for bioengineering of cyanobacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">mRNA translation relies on identifying translation initiation sites (TISs) in mRNAs. Alternative TISs are prevalent across plant transcriptomes, but the mechanisms for their recognition are unclear. Using ribosome profiling and machine learning, we developed models for predicting alternative TISs in Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Distinct feature sets were predictive of AUG and non-AUG TISs in 5&#39; untranslated regions and coding sequences, including a novel CU-rich sequence that promoted plant TIS activity, a translational enhancer found across dicots and monocots and also in humans and viruses. Our results elucidate the mechanistic and evolutionary basis of TIS recognition, whereby cis-regulatory RNA signatures affect start site selection. The TIS prediction model provides global estimates of TISs to discover neglected protein-coding genes across plant genomes. The prevalence of cis-regulatory signatures across eukaryotes and viruses suggests their broad, critical roles in reprogramming the translational landscape in the plant-virus arms race.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Respiratory chain dysfunction can decrease ATP and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Despite the importance of these metabolic parameters to a wide range of cellular functions and disease, we lack an integrated understanding of how they are differentially regulated. To address this question, we adapted a CRISPRi- and FACS-based platform to compare the effects of respiratory gene knockdown on ROS to their effects on ATP. Focusing on genes whose knockdown is known to decrease mitochondria-derived ATP, we showed that knockdown of genes in specific respiratory chain complexes (I, III and CoQ10 biosynthesis) increased ROS, whereas knockdown of other low ATP hits either had no impact (mitochondrial ribosomal proteins) or actually decreased ROS (complex IV). Moreover, although shifting metabolic conditions profoundly altered mitochondria-derived ATP levels, it had little impact on mitochondrial or cytosolic ROS. In addition, knockdown of a subset of complex I subunits--including NDUFA8, NDUFB4, and NDUFS8--decreased complex I activity, mitochondria-derived ATP and supercomplex level, but knockdown of these genes had differential effects on ROS. Conversely, we found an essential role for ether lipids in the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial ROS levels independent of ATP. Thus, our results identify specific metabolic regulators of cellular ATP and ROS balance that may help dissect the roles of these processes in disease and identify therapeutic strategies to independently target energy failure and oxidative stress.

SignificanceMitochondrial respiration generates both energy (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Insufficient energy and increased ROS from respiratory chain dysfunction may be central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and aging. We established a screening platform using CRISPR and fluorescent-cell sorting to compare the impact of decreasing respiratory chain proteins on ROS and ATP levels. The results provide the first systems-level analysis of how ROS and ATP are differentially regulated, and identify genes and respiratory chain complexes that can manipulate each independently. These findings advance our understanding of the relative contributions of ATP and ROS to disease pathophysiology, and guide the development of therapies to preserve energy while minimizing ROS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ageing is characterised at the molecular level by six transcriptional  hallmarks of ageing, that are commonly described as progressively affected as time passes. By contrast, the  Smurf assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing, that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state. We anticipate that increased attention to the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype will bring about significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing.

(A) Classic approaches for studying ageing tend to consider it as a black box affecting all individuals progressively from birth to death. Instead, the Smurf phenotype shows that life can be divided into two consecutive phases separated by an abrupt transition. (B) All individuals undergo this transition at a different moment in their life, prior to death. This allows us to switch from population based approaches, comparing bulks of age-matched individuals through time, to individuals-centred approaches relying on direct access to their transition status. (C) Such paradigm shift shows that hallmarks of ageing long thought to progressively change with age are actually mostly affected in a growing proportion of Smurfs, allowing for the identification of the chain of events accompanying ageing and death from natural causes. (D) By studying the behaviour of the ageing transcriptome as a function of chronological age and Smurfness separately, we demonstrate that the progressively changing transcriptional ageing signature, as described in Frenk &amp; Houseley (2018), is in fact the convolution changes accompanying chronological age signature (increased transcriptional noise) and changes associated with Smurfness (or biological age) signature (increased stress response and inflammation, decreased expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes). We also identified a hallmark partially associated with only old Smurfs (ATH5), suggesting that chronological age can affect, late in life, the Smurf response.
