C.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547297\nA common feature of complex systems is their ability to balance the flexibility needed to adapt to their environment with the rigidity required for robust function. It has been conjectured that living systems accomplish this by existing at the \"edge of chaos\", i.e., the critical boundary between ordered and disordered dynamics. Simple toy models of gene regulatory networks lend support to this idea, and mathematical tools developed for these toy models yield similar results when applied to experimentally-supported models of specific cellular regulatory mechanisms (functional modules). Here, however, we demonstrate that a deeper inspection of 72 experimentally-supported discrete dynamical models of functional modules reveals previously unobserved order in these systems on long time scales, suggesting greater rigidity in these systems than was previously conjectured. Our analysis relies on new measures that quantify the tendency of perturbations to spread through a discrete dynamical system. A benefit of our new approach is that it accounts for how system trajectories are mapped to phenotypes in practice. Because these measures are computationally expensive to estimate, existing tools were insufficient for the ensemble of models considered here. To simulate the tens of millions of trajectories required for convergence, we developed a multipurpose CUDA-based simulation tool, which we have made available as the open-source Python library cubewalkers. We find that in experimentally-supported models of biomolecular functional modules, perturbation propagation is more transitory than previously thought, and that even in cases where large perturbation cascades persist, their phenotypic effects are often minimal. Moreover, by examining the impact of update scheme on experimentally-supported models, we find evidence that stochasticity and desynchronization can lead to increased recovery from regulatory perturbation cascades in functional modules and uncover previously unreported population-level robustness to even timing perturbations in these systems. We identify specific biological mechanisms underlying these dynamical behaviors and highlight them in experimentally-supported regulatory networks from the systems biology literature. Based on novel measures and simulations, our results suggest that-contrary to current theory-functional modules of biological systems are ordered and far from the edge of chaos.\nBasal MET Phosphorylation is an Indicator of Hepatocyte Dysregulation in Liver Disease\nAuthors: Burbano de Lara, S.; Kemmer, S.; Biermayer, I.; Feiler, S.; Vlasov, A.; D'Alessandro, L. A.; Helm, B.; Dieter, Y.; Ghallab, A.; Hengstler, J. G.; Hoffmann, K.; Schilling, M.; Timmer, J.; Klingmueller, U.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547655\nChronic liver diseases are worldwide on the rise. Due to the rapidly increasing incidence, in particular in Western countries, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is gaining importance as the disease can develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes has been identified as the characteristic structural change in NAFLD development, but molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression remained unresolved. Here, we uncover in primary hepatocytes from a preclinical model fed with a Western diet (WD) a strong downregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and an upregulation of the MAPK pathway. Dynamic pathway modeling of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal transduction combined with global proteomics identifies that an elevated basal MET phosphorylation rate is the main driver of altered signaling leading to increased proliferation of WD-hepatocytes. Model-adaptation to patient-derived hepatocytes reveal patient-specific variability in basal MET phosphorylation, which correlates with patient outcome after liver surgery. Thus, dysregulated basal MET phosphorylation could be an indicator for the health status of the liver and thereby inform on the risk of a patient to suffer from liver failure after surgery.\nThe PP2A-like phosphatase Ppg1 mediates assembly of the Far complex to balance gluconeogenic outputs and adapt to glucose depletion\nAuthors: Niphadkar, S.; Karinje, L.; Laxman, S.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547494\nTo sustain growth in changing nutrient conditions, cells reorganize outputs of metabolic networks and appropriately reallocate resources. Signaling by reversible protein phosphorylation can control such metabolic adaptations. In contrast to kinases, the functions of phosphatases that enable metabolic adaptation as glucose depletes are poorly studied. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion screen, we identified the requirement of PP2A-like phosphatase Ppg1 for appropriate carbon allocations towards gluconeogenic outputs - trehalose, glycogen, UDP-glucose, UDP-GlcNAc - specifically after glucose depletion. This homeostatic Ppg1 function is mediated via regulation of the assembly of the Far complex - a multi-subunit complex that tethers to the ER and mitochondrial outer membranes as localized signaling hubs. We show that the Far complex assembly is Ppg1 catalytic activity-dependent. The assembled Far complex is required to maintain gluconeogenic outputs after glucose depletion. Glucose in turn regulates Far complex abundance. This Ppg1-mediated Far complex assembly, and dependent control of gluconeogenic outputs enhances adaptive growth under glucose depletion. Our study illustrates how protein dephosphorylation is required for the assembly of a multi-protein scaffold present in localized cytosolic pools, to thereby enable cells metabolically adapt to nutrient fluctuations.\nModeling of the Network Mediated by IL-36 Involved inPsoriasis\nAuthors: Pandey, S.; Tiwari, S.; Basu, S.; Mishra, R. K.; Pandey, R.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547538\nPathogenesis of inflammatory, chronic and common skin disease Psoriasis involves immune cells, skin cells (keratinocytes) and cytokines secreted by them. Hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes are believed to be a hallmark of it. Roles of several cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-15, IL-17 and IL-23 in Psoriasis have been explored through mathematical/computational models as well as experimentally. However, the role of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36 is still elusive, especially in the case of General Pustular Psoriasis, a prevalent type of Psoriasis. To explore the role of that here, we construct a network embodying indirect cell-cell interactions of a few immune and skin cells mediated by IL-36 based on the existing knowledge. Further, we develop a mathematical model for the network and study the steady-state behaviour of that. Our results demonstrate that an increase in the level of IL-36 could lead to the hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes and, thus, Psoriasis. In addition, the analysis suggests that the plaque formation and progression of Psoriasis could occur via a gradual or switch-like increase in the population of keratinocytes. The switch-like increase would be due to the bistable behaviour of the network and could be used as a novel treatment strategy, as proposed and demonstrated earlier.\nSimultaneous Multi-Omics Analysis by Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry (SMAD-MS)\nAuthors: Jiang, Y.; Salladay-Perez, I.; Momenzadeh, A.; Covarrubias, A. J.; Meyer, J. G.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546628\nCombined multi-omics analysis of proteomics, polar metabolomics, and lipidomics requires separate liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms for each omics layer. This requirement for different platforms limits throughput and increases costs, preventing the application of mass spectrometry-based multi-omics to large scale drug discovery or clinical cohorts. Here, we present an innovative strategy for simultaneous multi-omics analysis by direct infusion (SMAD) using one single injection without liquid chromatography. SMAD allows quantification of over 9,000 metabolite m/z features and over 1,300 proteins from the same sample in less than five minutes. We validated the efficiency and reliability of this method and then present two practical applications: mouse macrophage M1/M2 polarization and high throughput drug screening in human 293T cells. Finally, we demonstrate relationships between proteomic and metabolomic data are discovered by machine learning.\nSingle transcript-level metabolic responsive landscape of human liver transcriptome\nAuthors: Jiang, C.; Li, P.; Ma, Y.; Yoneda, N.; Nishiwaki, M.; Ohnishi, Y.; Suemizu, H.; Cao, H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.544842\nDirect knowledge of gene regulation in human liver by metabolic stimuli could fundamentally advance our understanding of metabolic physiology. This information, however, is largely unknown, and this void is deeply rooted in a paradox that is caused by the inaccessibility of human liver to treatments and the insufficient annotation of liver transcriptome. Recent advances have uncovered immense complexity of transcriptome, i.e., multiple transcripts produced from one gene and extensive RNA modifications, which are all highly regulated and often condition-dependent. Establishing an inclusive annotation to study liver transcriptome dynamics thus requires human liver samples of diverse conditions, which are paradoxically unavailable due to the inaccessibility of human liver to treatments. In this work, we addressed these challenges by coupling an isogenic humanized mouse model with Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS). We first generated mice that carried humanized livers of identical genetic background, which were equivalent to clones of a single human liver, and then subjected the mice to representative metabolic treatments. We then analyzed the humanized livers with Nanopore DRS, which directly reads full-length native RNAs to determine the expression level, m6A modification and poly(A) tail length of all RNA transcript isoforms. Thus, our system allows for constructing a de novo annotation of human liver transcriptomes reflecting metabolic responses and studying transcriptome dynamics in conjunction. Our analysis uncovered a vast number of novel genes and transcripts that have not been previously reported. Our transcript-level analysis of human liver transcriptomes also identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional short read RNA-seq. We also revealed for the first time the dynamic changes in m6A and poly(A) tail length of human liver transcripts many of which are transcribed from key metabolic genes. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of gene regulation between human and mouse and between two individuals using the liver-specific humanized mice. This revealed that transcriptome dynamics are highly species- and genetic background-dependent, which may only be faithfully studied in a humanized system that entails clones of the same human liver. Hence our work revealed a complex metabolic responsive landscape of human liver transcriptome and also provided a framework to understand transcriptome dynamics of human liver in response to physiologically relevant metabolic stimuli.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Chronic liver diseases are worldwide on the rise. Due to the rapidly increasing incidence, in particular in Western countries, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is gaining importance as the disease can develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes has been identified as the characteristic structural change in NAFLD development, but molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression remained unresolved. Here, we uncover in primary hepatocytes from a preclinical model fed with a Western diet (WD) a strong downregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and an upregulation of the MAPK pathway. Dynamic pathway modeling of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal transduction combined with global proteomics identifies that an elevated basal MET phosphorylation rate is the main driver of altered signaling leading to increased proliferation of WD-hepatocytes. Model-adaptation to patient-derived hepatocytes reveal patient-specific variability in basal MET phosphorylation, which correlates with patient outcome after liver surgery. Thus, dysregulated basal MET phosphorylation could be an indicator for the health status of the liver and thereby inform on the risk of a patient to suffer from liver failure after surgery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To sustain growth in changing nutrient conditions, cells reorganize outputs of metabolic networks and appropriately reallocate resources. Signaling by reversible protein phosphorylation can control such metabolic adaptations. In contrast to kinases, the functions of phosphatases that enable metabolic adaptation as glucose depletes are poorly studied. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion screen, we identified the requirement of PP2A-like phosphatase Ppg1 for appropriate carbon allocations towards gluconeogenic outputs - trehalose, glycogen, UDP-glucose, UDP-GlcNAc - specifically after glucose depletion. This homeostatic Ppg1 function is mediated via regulation of the assembly of the Far complex - a multi-subunit complex that tethers to the ER and mitochondrial outer membranes as localized signaling hubs. We show that the Far complex assembly is Ppg1 catalytic activity-dependent. The assembled Far complex is required to maintain gluconeogenic outputs after glucose depletion. Glucose in turn regulates Far complex abundance. This Ppg1-mediated Far complex assembly, and dependent control of gluconeogenic outputs enhances adaptive growth under glucose depletion. Our study illustrates how protein dephosphorylation is required for the assembly of a multi-protein scaffold present in localized cytosolic pools, to thereby enable cells metabolically adapt to nutrient fluctuations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pathogenesis of inflammatory, chronic and common skin disease Psoriasis involves immune cells, skin cells (keratinocytes) and cytokines secreted by them. Hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes are believed to be a hallmark of it. Roles of several cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-15, IL-17 and IL-23 in Psoriasis have been explored through mathematical/computational models as well as experimentally. However, the role of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-36 is still elusive, especially in the case of General Pustular Psoriasis, a prevalent type of Psoriasis. To explore the role of that here, we construct a network embodying indirect cell-cell interactions of a few immune and skin cells mediated by IL-36 based on the existing knowledge. Further, we develop a mathematical model for the network and study the steady-state behaviour of that. Our results demonstrate that an increase in the level of IL-36 could lead to the hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes and, thus, Psoriasis. In addition, the analysis suggests that the plaque formation and progression of Psoriasis could occur via a gradual or switch-like increase in the population of keratinocytes. The switch-like increase would be due to the bistable behaviour of the network and could be used as a novel treatment strategy, as proposed and demonstrated earlier.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Combined multi-omics analysis of proteomics, polar metabolomics, and lipidomics requires separate liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms for each omics layer. This requirement for different platforms limits throughput and increases costs, preventing the application of mass spectrometry-based multi-omics to large scale drug discovery or clinical cohorts. Here, we present an innovative strategy for simultaneous multi-omics analysis by direct infusion (SMAD) using one single injection without liquid chromatography. SMAD allows quantification of over 9,000 metabolite m/z features and over 1,300 proteins from the same sample in less than five minutes. We validated the efficiency and reliability of this method and then present two practical applications: mouse macrophage M1/M2 polarization and high throughput drug screening in human 293T cells. Finally, we demonstrate relationships between proteomic and metabolomic data are discovered by machine learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Direct knowledge of gene regulation in human liver by metabolic stimuli could fundamentally advance our understanding of metabolic physiology. This information, however, is largely unknown, and this void is deeply rooted in a paradox that is caused by the inaccessibility of human liver to treatments and the insufficient annotation of liver transcriptome. Recent advances have uncovered immense complexity of transcriptome, i.e., multiple transcripts produced from one gene and extensive RNA modifications, which are all highly regulated and often condition-dependent. Establishing an inclusive annotation to study liver transcriptome dynamics thus requires human liver samples of diverse conditions, which are paradoxically unavailable due to the inaccessibility of human liver to treatments. In this work, we addressed these challenges by coupling an isogenic humanized mouse model with Nanopore single-molecule direct RNA sequencing (DRS). We first generated mice that carried humanized livers of identical genetic background, which were equivalent to clones of a single human liver, and then subjected the mice to representative metabolic treatments. We then analyzed the humanized livers with Nanopore DRS, which directly reads full-length native RNAs to determine the expression level, m6A modification and poly(A) tail length of all RNA transcript isoforms. Thus, our system allows for constructing a de novo annotation of human liver transcriptomes reflecting metabolic responses and studying transcriptome dynamics in conjunction. Our analysis uncovered a vast number of novel genes and transcripts that have not been previously reported. Our transcript-level analysis of human liver transcriptomes also identified a multitude of regulated metabolic pathways that were otherwise invisible using conventional short read RNA-seq. We also revealed for the first time the dynamic changes in m6A and poly(A) tail length of human liver transcripts many of which are transcribed from key metabolic genes. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of gene regulation between human and mouse and between two individuals using the liver-specific humanized mice. This revealed that transcriptome dynamics are highly species- and genetic background-dependent, which may only be faithfully studied in a humanized system that entails clones of the same human liver. Hence our work revealed a complex metabolic responsive landscape of human liver transcriptome and also provided a framework to understand transcriptome dynamics of human liver in response to physiologically relevant metabolic stimuli.</p>
