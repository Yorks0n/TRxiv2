H.; Casanova, R.; Manson, J. E.; Bhatti, P.; Crimmins, E. M.; Assimes, T. L.; Whitsel, E. A.; Higgins-Chen, A. T.; Levine, M.\nScore: 40.5, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548904\nIndividuals, organs, tissues, and cells age in diverse ways throughout the lifespan. Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system, and often did so more strongly than existing epigenetic clocks that report single global measures. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.\nAmyloid β accelerates age-related proteome-wide protein insolubility.\nAuthors: Anderton, E.; Chamoli, M.; Bhaumik, D.; King, C. D.; Xie, X.; Foulger, A.; Andersen, J.; Schilling, B.; Lithgow, G.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548937\nLoss of proteostasis is a highly conserved feature of aging across model organisms and typically results in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Protein insolubility is a central feature of major age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where hundreds of insoluble proteins associate with aggregated amyloid beta (A{beta}) in senile plaques. Despite the established connection between aging and AD risk, therapeutic approaches to date have overlooked aging and proteome-wide protein insolubility as causal factors, instead focusing on A{beta} and Tau. Here, using an unbiased proteomics approach, we questioned the relationship between A{beta} and age-related protein insolubility. We demonstrate that, in C. elegans, A{beta} expression is sufficient to drive proteome-wide protein insolubility. The A{beta}-driven insoluble proteome bears a highly significant overlap with the aging-driven insoluble proteome, suggesting there exists a core, sub-proteome which is vulnerable to insolubility. Using human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we show that this insoluble sub proteome is replete with biological processes implicated across not only neurodegenerative diseases but also across a broad array of chronic, age-related diseases (CARDs), providing suggestive evidence that age-related loss of proteostasis could play a role in general CARD risk. Finally, we show that the gut metabolite, Urolithin A, relieves A{beta} toxicity supporting its use in clinical trials for dementia and other age-related diseases.\nThe timing of cellular events: a stochastic vs deterministic perspective\nAuthors: Ham, L.; Coomer, M. A.; Öcal, K.; Grima, R.; Stumpf, M. P. H.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549956\nChanges in cell state are driven by key molecular events whose timing can often be measured experimentally. Of particular interest is the time taken for the levels of RNA or protein molecules to reach a critical threshold defining the triggering of a cellular event. While this mean trigger time can be estimated by numerical integration of deterministic models, these ignore intrinsic noise and hence their predictions may be inaccurate. Here we study the differences between deterministic and stochastic model predictions for the mean trigger times using simple models of gene expression, post-transcriptional feedback control, and enzyme-mediated catalysis. By comparison of the two predictions, we show that when promoter switching is present there exists a transition from a parameter regime where deterministic models predict a longer trigger time than stochastic models to a regime where the opposite occurs. Furthermore, the ratio of the trigger times of the two models can be large, particularly for auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops. Our theory provides intuitive insight into the origin of these effects and shows that deterministic predictions for cellular event timing can be highly inaccurate when molecule numbers are within the range known for many cells.\nBiologically meaningful regulatory logic enhances the convergence rate in Boolean networks and bushiness of their state transition graph\nAuthors: Sil, P.; Subbaroyan, A.; Kulkarni, S.; Martin, O. C.; Samal, A.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.549398\nBoolean network (BN) models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have gained widespread traction as they can easily recapitulate cellular phenotypes via their attractor states. The overall dynamics of such models are embodied in the systems state transition graph (STG) which is highly informative. Indeed, even if two BN models have the same network structure and recover the same attractors, their STGs can be drastically different depending on the type of regulatory logic rules or Boolean functions (BFs) employed. A key objective of the present work is to systematically delineate the effects of different classes of regulatory logic rules on the structural features of the STG of reconstructed Boolean GRNs, while keeping BN structure and biological attractors fixed. Furthermore, we ask how such global features might be driven by characteristics of the underlying BFs. For that, we draw from ideas and concepts proposed in cellular automata for both the structural features and their associated proxies. We use the network of 10 reconstructed Boolean GRNs to generate ensembles that differ in the type of logic used while keeping their structure fixed and recovering their biological attractors, and compute quantities associated with the structural features of the STG: bushiness and convergence, that are based on the number of garden-of-Eden (GoE) states and transient times to reach attractor states when originating at them. We find that ensembles employing biologically meaningful BFs have higher bushiness and convergence than those employing random ones. Computing these global measures gets expensive with larger network sizes, stressing the need for more feasible proxies. We thus adapt Wuensches Z-parameter to BFs in BNs and provide 4 natural variants, which along with the network sensitivity, comprise our descriptors of local dynamics. One variant of the network Z-parameter as well as the network sensitivity correlate particularly very well with the bushiness, serving as a good proxy for the same. Finally, we provide an excellent proxy for the convergence based on computing transient lengths originating at random states rather than GoE states.\nA systems-level analysis of the mutually antagonistic roles of RKIP and BACH1 in dynamics of cancer cell plasticity\nAuthors: Shyam, S.; R, S.; Sehgal, M.; Jolly, M. K.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.08.547338\nPhenotypic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important axis of phenotypic plasticity. Raf kinase-B inhibitor protein (RKIP) and BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) are two proteins reported to influence EMT. In breast cancer, they act antagonistically, but the exact nature of their roles in mediating EMT and associated other axes of plasticity remains unclear. Here, analysing transcriptomic data, we reveal their antagonistic trends in a pan-cancer manner, in terms of association with EMT, metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion via PD-L1. Next, we developed and simulated a mechanism-based gene regulatory network that captures how RKIP and BACH1 engage in feedback loops with drivers of EMT and stemness. We found that RKIP and BACH1 belong to two separate \"teams\" of players - while BACH1 belonged to the one that drove pro-EMT, stem-like and therapy-resistant cell-states, RKIP is a member of a team that enables pro-epithelial, less stem-like and therapy-sensitive phenotypes. Finally, we observed that low RKIP levels and concomitant upregulated BACH1 levels associated with worse clinical outcomes in many cancer types. Together, our systems-level analysis indicates that the emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network underlie the antagonistic patterns of RKIP and BACH1 with various axes of cancer cell plasticity, as well as with patient survival data.\nUnveiling Hidden Connections in Omics Data via pyPARAGON: an Integrative Hybrid Approach for Disease Network Construction\nAuthors: Arici, K. M.; Tuncbag, N.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.547583\nOmics technologies are powerful tools for detecting dysregulated and altered signaling components in various contexts, encompassing disease states, patients, and drug-perturbations. Network inference or reconstruction algorithms play an integral role in the successful analysis and identification of causal relationships between omics hits. However, accurate representation of signaling networks and identification of context-specific interactions within sparse omics datasets in complex interactomes pose significant challenges in integrative approaches. To address these challenges, we present pyPARAGON (PAgeRAnk-flux on Graphlet-guided network for multi-Omic data integratioN), a novel tool that combines network propagation with graphlets. By leveraging network motifs instead of pairwise connections among proteins, pyPARAGON offers improved accuracy and reduces the inclusion of nonspecific interactions in signaling networks. Through comprehensive evaluations on benchmark cancer signaling pathways, we demonstrate that pyPARAGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in node propagation and edge inference. Furthermore, pyPARAGON exhibits promising performance in discovering cancer driver networks. Notably, we demonstrate its utility in network-based stratification of patient tumors by integrating phosphoproteomic data from 105 breast cancer tumors with the interactome, leading to the discovery of tumor-specific signaling pathways. Overall, the development and evaluation of pyPARAGON significantly contributes to the field as an effective tool for the analysis and integration of multi-omic data in the context of signaling networks. pyPARAGON is available at https://github.com/metunetlab/pyPARAGON.\nDeep spatial proteomic exploration of severe COVID-19-related pulmonary injury in post-mortem specimens\nAuthors: Mao, Y.; Chen, Y.; Li, Y.; Ma, L.; Wang, X.; Wang, Q.; He, A.; Liu, X.; Dong, T.; Gao, W.; Xu, Y.; Liu, L.; Ren, L.; Liu, Q.; Zhou, P.; Hu, B.; Zhou, Y.; Tian, R.; Shi, Z.-L.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548971\nThe lung, as a primary target of SARS-CoV-2, exhibits heterogeneous microenvironment accompanied by various histopathological changes following virus infection. However, comprehensive insight into the protein basis of COVID-19-related pulmonary injury with spatial resolution is currently deficient. Here, we generated a region-resolved quantitative proteomic atlas of seven major pathological structures within the lungs of COVID-19 victims by integrating histological examination, laser microdissection, and ultrasensitive proteomic technologies. Over 10,000 proteins were quantified across 71 dissected FFPE post-mortem specimens. By comparison with control samples, we identified a spectrum of COVID-19-induced protein and pathway dysregulations in alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, and pulmonary blood vessels, providing evidence for the proliferation of transitional-state pneumocytes. Additionally, we profiled the region-specific proteomes of hallmark COVID-19 pulmonary injuries, including bronchiole mucus plug, pulmonary fibrosis, airspace inflammation, and hyperplastic alveolar type 2 cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the enrichment of cell-type and functional markers in these regions (e.g. enriched TGFBI in fibrotic region). Furthermore, we identified the up-regulation of proteins associated with viral entry, host restriction, and inflammatory response in COVID-19 lungs, such as FURIN and HGF. Collectively, this study provides spatial proteomic insights for understanding COVID-19-caused pulmonary injury, and may serve as a valuable reference for improving therapeutic intervention for severe pneumonia.\nQuantifying mutational synergy using computational models predicts survival in haematological cancers\nAuthors: Norris, R.; Jones, J.; Mancini, E.; Chevassut, T.; Pepper, C.; Pepper, A.; Mitchell, S.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548371\nGenetic heterogeneity and co-occurring driver mutations contribute to poor clinical outcomes in cancer. However, the impact of multiple mutations on complex signalling networks is not easily predicted. We found that, by placing mutations into their cellular context, multi-scale agent- based mathematical models could predict how genetic events combine in haematological malignancies. Simulations of lymphoma and myeloma predicted co-occurring mutations synergised to increase tumour cell expansion beyond what would be expected from the impact of the individual mutations alone. Mutational synergy between MYC and BCL2 was consistent with the more aggressive disease course of patients with double-hit lymphoma, and mutational synergy between MCL1 and CKS1B was predictive of outcome in patients with gain 1q multiple myeloma. Incorporating patient-specific mutational profiles into personalised models of lymphoma patients with the worst clinical outcomes revealed a correlation between simulated mutational synergy and overall survival, which outperformed widely used classifications of lymphoma informed by gene expression or mutational data alone. Our results demonstrated that mutational synergy scores enabled prediction of the impact of co-occurring mutations and may improve personalised prognostic predictions.\nRegulatory start-stop elements in 5' untranslated regions pervasively modulate translation\nAuthors: Rendleman, J.; Haizel, S.; Wu, S.; Ge, X.; Liu, J.; Zou, H.; Mohammad, M. P.; Pressler, M.; Maity, S.; Hronova, V.; Gao, Z.; Herrmannova, A.; Lei, A.; Allgoewer, K.; Sultanov, D.; Hinckley, W. E.; Szkop, K.; Topisirovic, I.; Larsson, O.; Hatzoglou, M.; Valasek, L. S.; Vogel, C.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2021.07.26.453809\nVarious mechanisms controlling ribosome scanning and initiation have been identified within the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of eukaryotic genes, including upstream open reading frames, specific sequence motifs, and secondary structures. We describe the impact and distinct characteristics of a translation regulatory element consisting of a start codon immediately followed by a stop codon. While to date this start-stop element has been described only for specific cases, we identified them in the 5UTR of hundreds of human genes whereby their general impact on translation control in mammalian cells has been unnoticed. We show that the element is evolutionarily conserved and represses translation of the downstream open reading frames. While having no apparent impact on translation termination or RNA stability, start-stops efficiently halt ribosomes and act as a barrier for the scanning of the small ribosomal subunit. Start-stop element occurs in many transcription factors and key signaling genes, and we highlight routes in which they can affect cellular fate. We investigate the start-stop element in several genes, i.e. MORF4L1, IFNAR1, SLC39A1, and PSPC1, and delineate the role of the start-stop in translation regulation of ATF4 mRNA. Thus, start-stops uniquely modulate translation through elongation-less ribosome stalling.\nPoisson representation: a bridge between discrete and continuous models of stochastic gene regulatory networks\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Li, Y.; Jia, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549675\nStochastic gene expression dynamics can be modeled either discretely or continuously. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA or protein number distributions of some simple discrete and continuous gene expression models are related by Gardiner's Poisson representation. Here we systematically investigate the Poisson representation in complex stochastic gene regulatory networks. We show that when the gene of interest is unregulated, the discrete and continuous descriptions of stochastic gene expression are always related by the Poisson representation, no matter how complex the model is. In addition, using a simple counterexample, we find that the Poisson representation in general fails to link the two descriptions when the gene is regulated. However, for a general stochastic gene regulatory network, we demonstrate that the discrete and continuous models are approximately related by the Poisson representation in the limit of large protein numbers. These theoretical results are further applied to analytically solve many complex gene expression models whose exact distributions are previously unknown.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Individuals, organs, tissues, and cells age in diverse ways throughout the lifespan. Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system, and often did so more strongly than existing epigenetic clocks that report single global measures. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a highly conserved feature of aging across model organisms and typically results in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Protein insolubility is a central feature of major age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AD), where hundreds of insoluble proteins associate with aggregated amyloid beta (A{beta}) in senile plaques. Despite the established connection between aging and AD risk, therapeutic approaches to date have overlooked aging and proteome-wide protein insolubility as causal factors, instead focusing on A{beta} and Tau. Here, using an unbiased proteomics approach, we questioned the relationship between A{beta} and age-related protein insolubility. We demonstrate that, in C. elegans, A{beta} expression is sufficient to drive proteome-wide protein insolubility. The A{beta}-driven insoluble proteome bears a highly significant overlap with the aging-driven insoluble proteome, suggesting there exists a core, sub-proteome which is vulnerable to insolubility. Using human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we show that this insoluble sub proteome is replete with biological processes implicated across not only neurodegenerative diseases but also across a broad array of chronic, age-related diseases (CARDs), providing suggestive evidence that age-related loss of proteostasis could play a role in general CARD risk. Finally, we show that the gut metabolite, Urolithin A, relieves A{beta} toxicity supporting its use in clinical trials for dementia and other age-related diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Changes in cell state are driven by key molecular events whose timing can often be measured experimentally. Of particular interest is the time taken for the levels of RNA or protein molecules to reach a critical threshold defining the triggering of a cellular event. While this mean trigger time can be estimated by numerical integration of deterministic models, these ignore intrinsic noise and hence their predictions may be inaccurate. Here we study the differences between deterministic and stochastic model predictions for the mean trigger times using simple models of gene expression, post-transcriptional feedback control, and enzyme-mediated catalysis. By comparison of the two predictions, we show that when promoter switching is present there exists a transition from a parameter regime where deterministic models predict a longer trigger time than stochastic models to a regime where the opposite occurs. Furthermore, the ratio of the trigger times of the two models can be large, particularly for auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops. Our theory provides intuitive insight into the origin of these effects and shows that deterministic predictions for cellular event timing can be highly inaccurate when molecule numbers are within the range known for many cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Boolean network (BN) models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have gained widespread traction as they can easily recapitulate cellular phenotypes via their attractor states. The overall dynamics of such models are embodied in the systems state transition graph (STG) which is highly informative. Indeed, even if two BN models have the same network structure and recover the same attractors, their STGs can be drastically different depending on the type of regulatory logic rules or Boolean functions (BFs) employed. A key objective of the present work is to systematically delineate the effects of different classes of regulatory logic rules on the structural features of the STG of reconstructed Boolean GRNs, while keeping BN structure and biological attractors fixed. Furthermore, we ask how such global features might be driven by characteristics of the underlying BFs. For that, we draw from ideas and concepts proposed in cellular automata for both the structural features and their associated proxies. We use the network of 10 reconstructed Boolean GRNs to generate ensembles that differ in the type of logic used while keeping their structure fixed and recovering their biological attractors, and compute quantities associated with the structural features of the STG:  bushiness and  convergence, that are based on the number of garden-of-Eden (GoE) states and transient times to reach attractor states when originating at them. We find that ensembles employing biologically meaningful BFs have higher  bushiness and  convergence than those employing random ones. Computing these  global measures gets expensive with larger network sizes, stressing the need for more feasible proxies. We thus adapt Wuensches Z-parameter to BFs in BNs and provide 4 natural variants, which along with the network sensitivity, comprise our descriptors of local dynamics. One variant of the network Z-parameter as well as the network sensitivity correlate particularly very well with the bushiness, serving as a good proxy for the same. Finally, we provide an excellent proxy for the  convergence based on computing transient lengths originating at random states rather than GoE states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phenotypic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important axis of phenotypic plasticity. Raf kinase-B inhibitor protein (RKIP) and BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) are two proteins reported to influence EMT. In breast cancer, they act antagonistically, but the exact nature of their roles in mediating EMT and associated other axes of plasticity remains unclear. Here, analysing transcriptomic data, we reveal their antagonistic trends in a pan-cancer manner, in terms of association with EMT, metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion via PD-L1. Next, we developed and simulated a mechanism-based gene regulatory network that captures how RKIP and BACH1 engage in feedback loops with drivers of EMT and stemness. We found that RKIP and BACH1 belong to two separate &#34;teams&#34; of players - while BACH1 belonged to the one that drove pro-EMT, stem-like and therapy-resistant cell-states, RKIP is a member of a team that enables pro-epithelial, less stem-like and therapy-sensitive phenotypes. Finally, we observed that low RKIP levels and concomitant upregulated BACH1 levels associated with worse clinical outcomes in many cancer types. Together, our systems-level analysis indicates that the emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network underlie the antagonistic patterns of RKIP and BACH1 with various axes of cancer cell plasticity, as well as with patient survival data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Omics technologies are powerful tools for detecting dysregulated and altered signaling components in various contexts, encompassing disease states, patients, and drug-perturbations. Network inference or reconstruction algorithms play an integral role in the successful analysis and identification of causal relationships between omics hits. However, accurate representation of signaling networks and identification of context-specific interactions within sparse omics datasets in complex interactomes pose significant challenges in integrative approaches. To address these challenges, we present pyPARAGON (PAgeRAnk-flux on Graphlet-guided network for multi-Omic data integratioN), a novel tool that combines network propagation with graphlets. By leveraging network motifs instead of pairwise connections among proteins, pyPARAGON offers improved accuracy and reduces the inclusion of nonspecific interactions in signaling networks. Through comprehensive evaluations on benchmark cancer signaling pathways, we demonstrate that pyPARAGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in node propagation and edge inference. Furthermore, pyPARAGON exhibits promising performance in discovering cancer driver networks. Notably, we demonstrate its utility in network-based stratification of patient tumors by integrating phosphoproteomic data from 105 breast cancer tumors with the interactome, leading to the discovery of tumor-specific signaling pathways. Overall, the development and evaluation of pyPARAGON significantly contributes to the field as an effective tool for the analysis and integration of multi-omic data in the context of signaling networks. pyPARAGON is available at https://github.com/metunetlab/pyPARAGON.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The lung, as a primary target of SARS-CoV-2, exhibits heterogeneous microenvironment accompanied by various histopathological changes following virus infection. However, comprehensive insight into the protein basis of COVID-19-related pulmonary injury with spatial resolution is currently deficient. Here, we generated a region-resolved quantitative proteomic atlas of seven major pathological structures within the lungs of COVID-19 victims by integrating histological examination, laser microdissection, and ultrasensitive proteomic technologies. Over 10,000 proteins were quantified across 71 dissected FFPE post-mortem specimens. By comparison with control samples, we identified a spectrum of COVID-19-induced protein and pathway dysregulations in alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, and pulmonary blood vessels, providing evidence for the proliferation of transitional-state pneumocytes. Additionally, we profiled the region-specific proteomes of hallmark COVID-19 pulmonary injuries, including bronchiole mucus plug, pulmonary fibrosis, airspace inflammation, and hyperplastic alveolar type 2 cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the enrichment of cell-type and functional markers in these regions (e.g. enriched TGFBI in fibrotic region). Furthermore, we identified the up-regulation of proteins associated with viral entry, host restriction, and inflammatory response in COVID-19 lungs, such as FURIN and HGF. Collectively, this study provides spatial proteomic insights for understanding COVID-19-caused pulmonary injury, and may serve as a valuable reference for improving therapeutic intervention for severe pneumonia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genetic heterogeneity and co-occurring driver mutations contribute to poor clinical outcomes in cancer. However, the impact of multiple mutations on complex signalling networks is not easily predicted. We found that, by placing mutations into their cellular context, multi-scale agent- based mathematical models could predict how genetic events combine in haematological malignancies. Simulations of lymphoma and myeloma predicted co-occurring mutations synergised to increase tumour cell expansion beyond what would be expected from the impact of the individual mutations alone. Mutational synergy between MYC and BCL2 was consistent with the more aggressive disease course of patients with double-hit lymphoma, and mutational synergy between MCL1 and CKS1B was predictive of outcome in patients with gain 1q multiple myeloma. Incorporating patient-specific mutational profiles into personalised models of lymphoma patients with the worst clinical outcomes revealed a correlation between simulated mutational synergy and overall survival, which outperformed widely used classifications of lymphoma informed by gene expression or mutational data alone. Our results demonstrated that mutational synergy scores enabled prediction of the impact of co-occurring mutations and may improve personalised prognostic predictions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Various mechanisms controlling ribosome scanning and initiation have been identified within the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of eukaryotic genes, including upstream open reading frames, specific sequence motifs, and secondary structures. We describe the impact and distinct characteristics of a translation regulatory element consisting of a start codon immediately followed by a stop codon. While to date this start-stop element has been described only for specific cases, we identified them in the 5UTR of hundreds of human genes whereby their general impact on translation control in mammalian cells has been unnoticed. We show that the element is evolutionarily conserved and represses translation of the downstream open reading frames. While having no apparent impact on translation termination or RNA stability, start-stops efficiently halt ribosomes and act as a barrier for the scanning of the small ribosomal subunit. Start-stop element occurs in many transcription factors and key signaling genes, and we highlight routes in which they can affect cellular fate. We investigate the start-stop element in several genes, i.e. MORF4L1, IFNAR1, SLC39A1, and PSPC1, and delineate the role of the start-stop in translation regulation of ATF4 mRNA. Thus, start-stops uniquely modulate translation through elongation-less ribosome stalling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stochastic gene expression dynamics can be modeled either discretely or continuously. Previous studies have shown that the mRNA or protein number distributions of some simple discrete and continuous gene expression models are related by Gardiner&#39;s Poisson representation. Here we systematically investigate the Poisson representation in complex stochastic gene regulatory networks. We show that when the gene of interest is unregulated, the discrete and continuous descriptions of stochastic gene expression are always related by the Poisson representation, no matter how complex the model is. In addition, using a simple counterexample, we find that the Poisson representation in general fails to link the two descriptions when the gene is regulated. However, for a general stochastic gene regulatory network, we demonstrate that the discrete and continuous models are approximately related by the Poisson representation in the limit of large protein numbers. These theoretical results are further applied to analytically solve many complex gene expression models whose exact distributions are previously unknown.</p>
