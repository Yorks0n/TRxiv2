Here, we measured and integrated the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and multiple layers of the proteome in the brain of a short-lived killifish. We find that aging causes a decoupling between transcriptome and proteome. This leads to decreased abundance of proteins enriched in basic amino acids such as DNA/RNA-binding proteins and increased levels of others, independent of mRNA changes. Chronic proteasome impairment in vivo induces aging signatures in lysosomes and mitochondria. However, it does not recapitulate the age-related decoupling between transcripts and proteins. Instead, aberrant translation pausing and ensuing reduced ribosome availability reprogram the proteome independently of transcription. The age-linked changes in protein biogenesis likely enhance aggregation and reduce availability of key protein complexes, thus contributing to proteome dysfunction and aging hallmarks in older brains.

K.; Berndsen, K.; Phan, T. L.; Muqit, M. M.; Alessi, D. R.; Nirujogi, R. S.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550405\nTo facilitate analysis and sharing of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data we created tools called CURTAIN (https://curtain.proteo.info) and CURTAIN-PTM (https://curtainptm.proteo.info). These enable the non-MS expert to interactively peruse volcano plots; deconvolute primary experimental data to individual replicates that can be visualized in bar charts or violin plots allowing statistical analysis; and export of plots in SVG format. They also permit assessment of experimental quality by correlation matrix and profile plot. Within CURTAIN, the user can analyze domain structure, AlphaFold predicted structure, reported interactors, relative expression, disease and pharmaceutical links, and mutagenesis information on all selected hits. Moreover, CURTAIN-PTM permits the comparison of all identified PTM sites on protein(s) of interest with PTM information contained within selected databases. For phosphorylation site analysis CURTAIN-PTM links with the kinase library to predict upstream kinases that phosphorylate sites of interest. We provide examples of the utility of CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM in analyzing how targeted degradation of the PPM1H Rab phosphatase that counteracts the Parkinsons LRRK2 kinase impacts cellular protein levels and phosphorylation sites. We reanalyzed a ubiquitylation dataset, characterizing the PINK1-Parkin pathway activation in primary neurons, revealing new data of interest not highlighted previously. CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM are free to use and open-source and will enable researchers to share and maximize the analysis and impact of their proteomics data. We advocate that differential expression proteomic data should be published containing a shareable CURTAIN web-link, allowing readers to better explore their data. Significance StatementTo enable non-experts to better share and explore mass spectrometry data, we have generated using open-source software, interactive tools termed CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM. These tools enable users to save their analysis sessions with a sharable unique web-link, enabling other researchers to visualize and further analyze these datasets. These links can also be reported in publications allowing readers to further survey the reported data. We discuss benefits for the research community of publishing proteomic data containing a shareable web-link.\nSpatial Metabolome Lipidome and Glycome from a Single brain Section\nAuthors: Clarke, H.

They are metabolically channeled through a myriad of pathways and molecular processes that define the physiology and pathology of an organism. Here, we present a blueprint for the simultaneous analysis of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section using mass spectrometry imaging. Complimenting an original experimental protocol, our workflow includes a computational framework called Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami) that offers multiomics integration, high dimensionality clustering, spatial anatomical mapping with matched multiomics features, and metabolic pathway enrichment to providing unprecedented insights into the spatial distribution and interaction of these biomolecules in mammalian tissue biology.\nProstate Cancer Reshapes the Secreted and Extracellular Vesicle Urinary Proteomes\nAuthors: Khoo, A.; Govindarajan, M.; Qui, Z.; Liu, L.

C.; Kislinger, T.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.550214\nUrine is a complex biofluid that reflects both overall physiologic state and the state of the genitourinary tissues through which it passes. It contains both secreted proteins and proteins encapsulated in tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). To understand the population variability and clinical utility of urine, we quantified the secreted and EV proteomes from 190 men, including a subset with prostate cancer. We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions, and can risk-stratify prostate tumors. This resource quantifies the complexity of the urinary proteome, and reveals the synergistic value of secreted and EV proteomes for translational and biomarker studies.\nSystems Age: A single blood methylation test to quantify aging heterogeneity across 11 physiological systems\nAuthors: Sehgal, R.; Meer, M.; Shadyab, A.

T.; Levine, M.\nScore: 42.6, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548904\nIndividuals, organs, tissues, and cells age in diverse ways throughout the lifespan. Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system, and often did so more strongly than existing epigenetic clocks that report single global measures. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.\nThe timing of cellular events: a stochastic vs deterministic perspective\nAuthors: Ham, L.; Coomer, M. A.; Öcal, K.; Grima, R.; Stumpf, M. P. H.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549956\nChanges in cell state are driven by key molecular events whose timing can often be measured experimentally. Of particular interest is the time taken for the levels of RNA or protein molecules to reach a critical threshold defining the triggering of a cellular event. While this mean trigger time can be estimated by numerical integration of deterministic models, these ignore intrinsic noise and hence their predictions may be inaccurate. Here we study the differences between deterministic and stochastic model predictions for the mean trigger times using simple models of gene expression, post-transcriptional feedback control, and enzyme-mediated catalysis. By comparison of the two predictions, we show that when promoter switching is present there exists a transition from a parameter regime where deterministic models predict a longer trigger time than stochastic models to a regime where the opposite occurs. Furthermore, the ratio of the trigger times of the two models can be large, particularly for auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops. Our theory provides intuitive insight into the origin of these effects and shows that deterministic predictions for cellular event timing can be highly inaccurate when molecule numbers are within the range known for many cells.\nEnhanced cell segmentation with limited annotated data using generative adversarial networks\nAuthors: Zargari, A.; Mashhadi, N.; Shariati, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550715\nThe application of deep learning is rapidly transforming the field of bioimage analysis. While deep learning has shown great promise in complex microscopy tasks such as single-cell segmentation, development of generalizable foundation deep learning segmentation models is hampered by the scarcity of large and diverse annotated datasets of cell images for training purposes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic images that can potentially be easily used to train deep learning models without the generation of a large manually annotated microscopy images. Here, we propose a customized CycleGAN architecture to train an enhanced cell segmentation model with limited annotated cell images, effectively addressing the challenge of paucity of annotated data in microscopy imaging. Our customized CycleGAN model can generate realistic synthetic images of cells with morphological details and nuances very similar to that of real images. This method not only increases the variability seen during training but also enhances the authenticity of synthetic samples, thereby enhancing the overall predictive accuracy and robustness of the cell segmentation model. Our experimental results show that our CycleGAN-based method significantly improves the performance of the segmentation model compared to conventional training techniques. Interestingly, we demonstrate that our model can extrapolate its knowledge by synthesizing imaging scenarios that were not seen during the training process. Our proposed customized CycleGAN method will accelerate development of foundation models for cell segmentation in microcopy images.\nAmyloid β accelerates age-related proteome-wide protein insolubility.\nAuthors: Anderton, E.; Chamoli, M.; Bhaumik, D.; King, C. D.; Xie, X.; Foulger, A.; Andersen, J.; Schilling, B.; Lithgow, G.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548937\nLoss of proteostasis is a highly conserved feature of aging across model organisms and typically results in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Protein insolubility is a central feature of major age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where hundreds of insoluble proteins associate with aggregated amyloid beta (A{beta}) in senile plaques. Despite the established connection between aging and AD risk, therapeutic approaches to date have overlooked aging and proteome-wide protein insolubility as causal factors, instead focusing on A{beta} and Tau. Here, using an unbiased proteomics approach, we questioned the relationship between A{beta} and age-related protein insolubility. We demonstrate that, in C. elegans, A{beta} expression is sufficient to drive proteome-wide protein insolubility. The A{beta}-driven insoluble proteome bears a highly significant overlap with the aging-driven insoluble proteome, suggesting there exists a core, sub-proteome which is vulnerable to insolubility. Using human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we show that this insoluble sub proteome is replete with biological processes implicated across not only neurodegenerative diseases but also across a broad array of chronic, age-related diseases (CARDs), providing suggestive evidence that age-related loss of proteostasis could play a role in general CARD risk. Finally, we show that the gut metabolite, Urolithin A, relieves A{beta} toxicity supporting its use in clinical trials for dementia and other age-related diseases.\nTranscriptomic signatures of progressive and regressive liver fibrosis and portal hypertension\nAuthors: Petrenko, O.; Koenigshofer, P.; Brusilovskaya, K.; Hofer, B. S.; Bareiner, K.; Simbrunner, B.; Trauner, M.; Kauschke, S. G.; Pfisterer, L.; Simon, E.; Rendeiro, A.; de Rooij, L.; Schwabl, P.; Reiberger, T.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.550133\nPersistent liver injury triggers a fibrogenic program that causes pathologic remodelling of the hepatic microenvironment (i.e., liver fibrosis) and portal hypertension. The dynamics of gene regulation during liver disease progression and regression remain understudied. Here, we generated hepatic transcriptome profiles in two well-established liver disease models at peak fibrosis and during spontaneous regression after the removal of the inducing agents. We linked the dynamics of key liver disease readouts, such as portal pressure, collagen proportionate area, and transaminase serum levels, to most differentially expressed genes, enabling the identification of transcriptomic signatures of progressive vs. regressive liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. These candidate biomarkers (e.g., Scube1, Tcf4, Src, Hmga1, Trem2, Mafk, Mmp7) were also validated in RNA-seq datasets of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Finally, deconvolution analysis identified major cell types and suggested an association of macrophage and portal hepatocyte signatures with portal hypertension and fibrosis area in both models.\nMachine Learning identifies conserved traits that influence lifespan and healthspan responses to dietary restriction\nAuthors: Hilsabeck, T. A.; Narayan, V. P.; Wilson, K. A.; Carrera, E.; Raftery, D.; Promislow, D. E.; Brem, R. B.; Campisi, J. A.; Kapahi, P.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.09.548232\nDietary restriction (DR) is the most robust means to extend lifespan and healthspan across species, but factors such as genetic variation affect how an individual will respond to DR. Additionally, it is unclear how cumulative variations in metabolism and the metabolome influence longevity and health. We utilized metabolomic, phenotypic, and genome-wide data from Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel strains raised under ad libitum and DR conditions to identify factors which influence longevity and health in response to dietary modulation. We found multiple intra-dataset correlations (e.g., metabolites with metabolites) but few inter-dataset correlations (e.g., metabolites with health-related phenotypes). Through random forest modeling across all traits and Mendelian Randomization, we found key translatable traits that influence lifespan or healthspan determination and validated the role of multiple metabolites in regulating lifespan. Through these approaches, we utilized data from flies and humans to elucidate potential therapeutic pathways and metabolomic targets for diet response, lifespan, and healthspan.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Protein homeostasis is disrupted in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, yet, the specific impact of aging on brain proteostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we measured and integrated the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and multiple layers of the proteome in the brain of a short-lived killifish. We find that aging causes a decoupling between transcriptome and proteome. This leads to decreased abundance of proteins enriched in basic amino acids such as DNA/RNA-binding proteins and increased levels of others, independent of mRNA changes. Chronic proteasome impairment in vivo induces aging signatures in lysosomes and mitochondria. However, it does not recapitulate the age-related decoupling between transcripts and proteins. Instead, aberrant translation pausing and ensuing reduced ribosome availability reprogram the proteome independently of transcription. The age-linked changes in protein biogenesis likely enhance aggregation and reduce availability of key protein complexes, thus contributing to proteome dysfunction and aging hallmarks in older brains.

        <p class="abstract">To facilitate analysis and sharing of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data we created tools called CURTAIN (https://curtain.proteo.info) and CURTAIN-PTM (https://curtainptm.proteo.info). These enable the non-MS expert to interactively peruse volcano plots; deconvolute primary experimental data to individual replicates that can be visualized in bar charts or violin plots allowing statistical analysis; and export of plots in SVG format. They also permit assessment of experimental quality by correlation matrix and profile plot. Within CURTAIN, the user can analyze domain structure, AlphaFold predicted structure, reported interactors, relative expression, disease and pharmaceutical links, and mutagenesis information on all selected hits. Moreover, CURTAIN-PTM permits the comparison of all identified PTM sites on protein(s) of interest with PTM information contained within selected databases. For phosphorylation site analysis CURTAIN-PTM links with the kinase library to predict upstream kinases that phosphorylate sites of interest. We provide examples of the utility of CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM in analyzing how targeted degradation of the PPM1H Rab phosphatase that counteracts the Parkinsons LRRK2 kinase impacts cellular protein levels and phosphorylation sites. We reanalyzed a ubiquitylation dataset, characterizing the PINK1-Parkin pathway activation in primary neurons, revealing new data of interest not highlighted previously. CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM are free to use and open-source and will enable researchers to share and maximize the analysis and impact of their proteomics data. We advocate that differential expression proteomic data should be published containing a shareable CURTAIN web-link, allowing readers to better explore their data.

Significance StatementTo enable non-experts to better share and explore mass spectrometry data, we have generated using open-source software, interactive tools termed CURTAIN and CURTAIN-PTM. These tools enable users to save their analysis sessions with a sharable unique web-link, enabling other researchers to visualize and further analyze these datasets. These links can also be reported in publications allowing readers to further survey the reported data. We discuss benefits for the research community of publishing proteomic data containing a shareable web-link.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolites, lipids, and glycans are fundamental biomolecules involved in complex biological systems. They are metabolically channeled through a myriad of pathways and molecular processes that define the physiology and pathology of an organism. Here, we present a blueprint for the simultaneous analysis of spatial metabolome, lipidome, and glycome from a single tissue section using mass spectrometry imaging. Complimenting an original experimental protocol, our workflow includes a computational framework called Spatial Augmented Multiomics Interface (Sami) that offers multiomics integration, high dimensionality clustering, spatial anatomical mapping with matched multiomics features, and metabolic pathway enrichment to providing unprecedented insights into the spatial distribution and interaction of these biomolecules in mammalian tissue biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Urine is a complex biofluid that reflects both overall physiologic state and the state of the genitourinary tissues through which it passes. It contains both secreted proteins and proteins encapsulated in tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). To understand the population variability and clinical utility of urine, we quantified the secreted and EV proteomes from 190 men, including a subset with prostate cancer. We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions, and can risk-stratify prostate tumors. This resource quantifies the complexity of the urinary proteome, and reveals the synergistic value of secreted and EV proteomes for translational and biomarker studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals, organs, tissues, and cells age in diverse ways throughout the lifespan. Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system, and often did so more strongly than existing epigenetic clocks that report single global measures. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Changes in cell state are driven by key molecular events whose timing can often be measured experimentally. Of particular interest is the time taken for the levels of RNA or protein molecules to reach a critical threshold defining the triggering of a cellular event. While this mean trigger time can be estimated by numerical integration of deterministic models, these ignore intrinsic noise and hence their predictions may be inaccurate. Here we study the differences between deterministic and stochastic model predictions for the mean trigger times using simple models of gene expression, post-transcriptional feedback control, and enzyme-mediated catalysis. By comparison of the two predictions, we show that when promoter switching is present there exists a transition from a parameter regime where deterministic models predict a longer trigger time than stochastic models to a regime where the opposite occurs. Furthermore, the ratio of the trigger times of the two models can be large, particularly for auto-regulatory genetic feedback loops. Our theory provides intuitive insight into the origin of these effects and shows that deterministic predictions for cellular event timing can be highly inaccurate when molecule numbers are within the range known for many cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The application of deep learning is rapidly transforming the field of bioimage analysis. While deep learning has shown great promise in complex microscopy tasks such as single-cell segmentation, development of generalizable foundation deep learning segmentation models is hampered by the scarcity of large and diverse annotated datasets of cell images for training purposes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can generate realistic images that can potentially be easily used to train deep learning models without the generation of a large manually annotated microscopy images. Here, we propose a customized CycleGAN architecture to train an enhanced cell segmentation model with limited annotated cell images, effectively addressing the challenge of paucity of annotated data in microscopy imaging. Our customized CycleGAN model can generate realistic synthetic images of cells with morphological details and nuances very similar to that of real images. This method not only increases the variability seen during training but also enhances the authenticity of synthetic samples, thereby enhancing the overall predictive accuracy and robustness of the cell segmentation model. Our experimental results show that our CycleGAN-based method significantly improves the performance of the segmentation model compared to conventional training techniques. Interestingly, we demonstrate that our model can extrapolate its knowledge by synthesizing imaging scenarios that were not seen during the training process. Our proposed customized CycleGAN method will accelerate development of foundation models for cell segmentation in microcopy images.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Loss of proteostasis is a highly conserved feature of aging across model organisms and typically results in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates. Protein insolubility is a central feature of major age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (AD), where hundreds of insoluble proteins associate with aggregated amyloid beta (A{beta}) in senile plaques. Despite the established connection between aging and AD risk, therapeutic approaches to date have overlooked aging and proteome-wide protein insolubility as causal factors, instead focusing on A{beta} and Tau. Here, using an unbiased proteomics approach, we questioned the relationship between A{beta} and age-related protein insolubility. We demonstrate that, in C. elegans, A{beta} expression is sufficient to drive proteome-wide protein insolubility. The A{beta}-driven insoluble proteome bears a highly significant overlap with the aging-driven insoluble proteome, suggesting there exists a core, sub-proteome which is vulnerable to insolubility. Using human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we show that this insoluble sub proteome is replete with biological processes implicated across not only neurodegenerative diseases but also across a broad array of chronic, age-related diseases (CARDs), providing suggestive evidence that age-related loss of proteostasis could play a role in general CARD risk. Finally, we show that the gut metabolite, Urolithin A, relieves A{beta} toxicity supporting its use in clinical trials for dementia and other age-related diseases.</p>

Here, we generated hepatic transcriptome profiles in two well-established liver disease models at peak fibrosis and during spontaneous regression after the removal of the inducing agents. We linked the dynamics of key liver disease readouts, such as portal pressure, collagen proportionate area, and transaminase serum levels, to most differentially expressed genes, enabling the identification of transcriptomic signatures of progressive vs. regressive liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. These candidate biomarkers (e.g., Scube1, Tcf4, Src, Hmga1, Trem2, Mafk, Mmp7) were also validated in RNA-seq datasets of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Finally, deconvolution analysis identified major cell types and suggested an association of macrophage and portal hepatocyte signatures with portal hypertension and fibrosis area in both models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dietary restriction (DR) is the most robust means to extend lifespan and healthspan across species, but factors such as genetic variation affect how an individual will respond to DR. Additionally, it is unclear how cumulative variations in metabolism and the metabolome influence longevity and health. We utilized metabolomic, phenotypic, and genome-wide data from Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel strains raised under ad libitum and DR conditions to identify factors which influence longevity and health in response to dietary modulation. We found multiple intra-dataset correlations (e.g., metabolites with metabolites) but few inter-dataset correlations (e.g., metabolites with health-related phenotypes). Through random forest modeling across all traits and Mendelian Randomization, we found key translatable traits that influence lifespan or healthspan determination and validated the role of multiple metabolites in regulating lifespan. Through these approaches, we utilized data from flies and humans to elucidate potential therapeutic pathways and metabolomic targets for diet response, lifespan, and healthspan.</p>
