S. e.; McGinnis, L.; Li, B.; Singh, A.; Garraway, L.; Rozenblatt-Rosen, O.; Regev, A.; Lubeck, E.\nScore: 49.6, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573143\nOptical pooled screening (OPS) is a highly scalable method for linking image-based phenotypes with cellular perturbations. However, it has thus far been restricted to relatively low-plex phenotypic readouts in cancer cell lines in culture, due to limitations associated with in situ sequencing (ISS) of perturbation barcodes. Here, we developed PerturbView, an OPS technology that leverages in vitro transcription (IVT) to amplify barcodes prior to ISS, enabling screens with highly multiplexed phenotypic readouts across diverse systems, including primary cells and tissues. We demonstrate PerturbView in iPSC-derived neurons, primary immune cells, and tumor tissue sections from animal models. In a screen of immune signaling pathways in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, PerturbView uncovered both known and novel regulators of NF{kappa}B signaling. Furthermore, we combined PerturbView with spatial transcriptomics in tissue sections from a mouse xenograft model, paving the way to in vivo screens with rich optical and transcriptomic phenotypes. PerturbView broadens the scope of OPS to a wide range of models and applications.\nAutism genes converge on microtubule biology and RNA-binding proteins during excitatory neurogenesis\nAuthors: Sun, N.; Teyssier, N.; Wang, B.; Drake, S.; Seyler, M.; Zaltsman, Y.; Everitt, A.; Teerikorpi, N.; Willsey, H. R.; Goodarzi, H.; Tian, R.; Kampmann, M.; Willsey, J.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573108\nRecent studies have identified over one hundred high-confidence (hc) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes. Systems biological and functional analyses on smaller subsets of these genes have consistently implicated excitatory neurogenesis. However, the extent to which the broader set of hcASD genes are involved in this process has not been explored systematically nor have the biological pathways underlying this convergence been identified. Here, we leveraged CROP-Seq to repress 87 hcASD genes in a human in vitro model of cortical neurogenesis. We identified 17 hcASD genes whose repression significantly alters developmental trajectory and results in a common cellular state characterized by disruptions in proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, microtubule biology, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We also characterized over 3,000 differentially expressed genes, 286 of which had expression profiles correlated with changes in developmental trajectory. Overall, we uncovered transcriptional disruptions downstream of hcASD gene perturbations, correlated these disruptions with distinct differentiation phenotypes, and reinforced neurogenesis, microtubule biology, and RBPs as convergent points of disruption in ASD.\nBroad H3K4me3 Domain Is Associated with Spatial Coherence during Mammalian Embryonic Development\nAuthors: Cao, X.; Ma, T.; Fan, R.; Yuan, G.-C.\nScore: 17.2, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.570452\nIt is well known that the chromatin states play a major role in cell-fate decision and cell-identity maintenance; however, the spatial variation of chromatin states in situ remains poorly characterized. Here, by leveraging recently available spatial-CUT\u0026Tag data, we systematically characterized the global spatial organization of the H3K4me3 profiles in a mouse embryo. Our analysis identified a subset of genes with spatially coherent H3K4me3 patterns, which together delineate the tissue boundaries. The spatially coherent genes are strongly enriched with tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Remarkably, their corresponding genomic loci are marked by broad H3K4me3 domains, which is distinct from the typical H3K4me3 signature. Spatial transition across tissue boundaries is associated with continuous shortening of the broad H3K4me3 domains as well as expansion of H3K27me3 domains. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between the genomic and spatial variation of chromatin states, which may play an important role in embryonic development.\nTransient power-law behaviour following induction distinguishes between competing models of stochastic gene expression\nAuthors: Nicoll, A. G.; Szavits-Nossan, J.; Evans, M. R.; Grima, R.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573521\nWhat features of transcription can be learnt by fitting mathematical models of gene expression to mRNA count data? Given a suite of models, fitting to data selects an optimal one, thus identifying a probable transcriptional mechanism. Whilst attractive, the utility of this methodology remains unclear. Here, we sample steady-state, single-cell mRNA count distributions from parameters in the physiological range, and show they cannot be used to confidently estimate the number of inactive gene states, i.e. the number of rate-limiting steps in transcriptional initiation. Distributions from over 99% of the parameter space generated using models with 2, 3, or 4 inactive states can be well fit by one with a single inactive state. However, we show that if the mRNA lifetime is hours long, then for many minutes following induction, the increase in the mean mRNA count obeys a power law whose exponent equals the sum of the number of states visited from the initial inactive state to the active state and the number of rate-limiting post-transcriptional processing steps. Our study shows that non-linear regression estimation of the exponent from eukaryotic data is sufficient to estimate the total number of regulatory steps in transcription initiation, splicing, and nuclear export.\nMetalinksDB: a flexible and contextualizable resource of metabolite-protein interactions\nAuthors: Farr, E. B.; Dimitrov, D.; Turei, D.; Schmidt, C.; Lobentanzer, S.; Dugourd, A.; Saez-Rodriguez, J.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573715\nInteractions between proteins and metabolites are key for cellular function, from the catalytic breakdown of nutrients to signaling. An important case is cell-cell communication, where cellular metabolites are secreted into the microenvironment and initiate a signaling cascade by binding to an intra- or extracellular receptor of another cell. While protein-protein mediated cell-cell communication is routinely inferred from transcriptomic data, for metabolite-protein interactions this is challenging due to the limitations of high-throughput single-cell and spatial metabolomics technologies, together with the absence of comprehensive prior knowledge resources that include metabolites. Here we report MetalinksDB, a comprehensive and flexible database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions that is a magnitude larger than existing ones. MetalinksDB can be tailored to specific biological contexts such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations by querying subsets of interactions using the web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) or the knowledge graph adapters. We showcase the use of MetalinksDB by identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer patients from multi-omics data as well as inferring metabolite-mediated cell-cell communication events driving acute kidney injury from spatial transcriptomic data. We anticipate that MetalinksDB will facilitate the study of metabolite-mediated communication processes.

J.; Vanhaesebroeck, B.\nScore: 28.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573207\nPathological activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is among the most frequent defects in human cancer and is also the cause of rare overgrowth disorders. Yet, there is currently no systematic understanding of the quantitative flow of information within PI3K/AKT signaling and how it is perturbed by disease-causing mutations. Here, we develop scalable, single-cell approaches for systematic analyses of signal processing within the PI3K pathway, enabling precise calculations of its information transfer for different growth factors. Using genetically-engineered human cell models with allele dose-dependent expression of PIK3CAH1047R, we show that this oncogene is not a simple, constitutive pathway activator but a context-dependent modulator of extracellular signal transfer. PIK3CAH1047Rreduces information transmission downstream of IGF1 while selectively enhancing EGF-induced signaling and transcriptional responses. This leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, akin to \"blurred\" signal perception. The associated increase in signaling heterogeneity promotes phenotypic diversity in a human cervical cancer cell line model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Collectively, these findings and the accompanying methodological advances lay the foundations for a systematic mapping of the quantitative mechanisms of PI3K/AKT-dependent signal processing and phenotypic control in health and disease. One-sentence summarySingle-cell signaling and information theoretic analyses reveal that oncogenic PI3K/AKT activation leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, context-dependent EGF response amplification as well as increased phenotypic heterogeneity.\nPhenylketonuria: modelling cerebral amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism\nAuthors: Wegrzyn, A. B.; van Vliet, D.; van Eunen, K.; Heiner-Fokkema, M. R.; van der Zee, E. A.; van Spronsen, F.; Bakker, B. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574352\nObjective: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which primarily converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. Despite a phenylalanine-deprived diet, many adult PKU patients display deficits of executive functions. These are hypothesised to be caused by high cerebral phenylalanine and a shortage of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Method: To better understand the relationship between plasma and brain amino acid levels and monoaminergic neurotransmitter biochemistry, we constructed a computational model. The model comprises the transport of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) across the blood-brain barrier as well as cerebral amino acid and monoaminergic neurotransmitter metabolism and was validated by direct measurements of brain amino acid concentrations in PKU mice on various diets. Results: The model predicts that brain amino acids are positively controlled by the concentrations of the corresponding amino acids in the blood, and to a lesser extent negatively by other amino acids competing for the transport systems. The model suggests that brain levels of monoaminergic neurotransmitters are controlled more by phenylalanine, probably through non-competitive inhibition of the hydroxylases rather than by their precursor amino acids. Therefore, the model predicts that the decrease of neurotransmitters in PKU cannot be fully rescued by the addition of tyrosine and tryptophan alone, but also benefits from a reduction of the phenylalanine level. Thereby, the model substantiates the experimental data of the synergistic effect of both brain phenylalanine reduction and increased precursor amino acid availability to improve brain neurotransmitters in PKU mice. Conclusion: We present the first complete model of the LNAA transport through the blood-brain barrier and subsequent brain neurotransmitter metabolism in PKU. The model leads to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of individual amino acids in the diet on the underlying brain dysfunction in PKU. Moreover, it identifies gaps in our current knowledge about the LNAA transport across the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the model can be readily applied in studies of other neurological disorders in which the relation between diet, gene activities, brain amino acids, and neurotransmitters is important.\nOptimization-Based Synthesis with Directed Cell Migration\nAuthors: Havenhill, E.; Ghosh, S.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573173\nCollective behavior of biological agents such as herds of organisms and cells is a fundamental feature in the systems biology and in the emergence of new phenomena in the biological environ-ment. Collective cell migration under a physical or chemical cue is an example of this fundamental phenomenon where individual cell migration is driven by the collective behavior of the neighboring cells and vice versa. The goal of this research is to discover the mathematical rules of collective cell migration using experimental data and testing the predictive nature of the models in independent experimental data. Such insight is made possible in this work with the hybrid use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) [1] and optimal control theory. Both single and multi-cellular systems are simulated, including obstacle courses, using this framework. The results of this work show how cells collectively behave during their migration and also, opens the possibility of designing robotic cells for possible therapeutic purpose where the cell trajectory can be controlled.\nIntegrating Residual Networks and Symbolic Regression for Biological ODE System Modeling\nAuthors: Yi, Z.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573840\nThis research presents a novel approach to biological Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system modeling, combining Residual Networks (ResNet) with symbolic regression techniques. Our methodology is designed to simulate biological systems more realistically than traditional numerical fitting methods. By utilizing logarithmic and exponential functions within the ResNet, our model effectively mirrors manual equation formulation while maintaining compatibility with neural network principles. The models performance was evaluated using data from two distinct studies, demonstrating its ability to accurately capture both linear dynamics and complex, periodic patterns in gene regulatory networks. This innovative approach offers a promising path for exploring systems biology, highlighting the potential of merging diverse methodologies to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.\nNon-genetic adaptation by collective migration\nAuthors: Vo, L.; Avgidis, F.; Mattingly, H.; Balasubramanian, R.; Shimizu, T. S.; Kazmierczak, B. I.; Emonet, T.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573956\nCollective behaviors require coordination of individuals. Thus, a population must adjust its phenotypic distribution to adapt to changing environments. How can a population regulate its phenotypic distribution? One strategy is to utilize specialized networks for gene regulation and maintaining distinct phenotypic subsets. Another involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse across diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. Surprisingly, we found that during collective migration, the distributions of swimming phenotypes adapt to the environment without mutations or gene regulation. Instead, adaptation is caused by the dynamic and reversible enrichment of high-performing swimming phenotypes within each environment. This adaptation mechanism is supported by a recent theoretical study, which proposed that the phenotypic composition of a migrating population results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating the phenotypes that are unable to keep up with the migrating group. Furthermore, by examining chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration towards different attractants, we found that this mechanism acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. Our findings reveal that collective migration itself can enable cell populations with continuous, multi-dimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions. Significance statementConventional cell adaptation mechanisms, like gene regulation and random phenotypic switching, act swiftly but are limited to a few traits, while mutation-driven adaptations unfold slowly. By quantifying phenotypic diversity during bacterial collective migration, we discovered an adaptation mechanism that rapidly and reversibly adjusts multiple traits simultaneously. By dynamically balancing the elimination of phenotypes unable to keep pace with generation of diversity through growth, this process enables populations to tune their phenotypic composition based on the environment, without the need for gene regulation or mutations. Given the prevalence of collective migration in microbes, cancers, and embryonic development, non-genetic adaptation through collective migration may be a universal mechanism for populations to navigate diverse environments, offering insights into broader applications across various fields.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Optical pooled screening (OPS) is a highly scalable method for linking image-based phenotypes with cellular perturbations. However, it has thus far been restricted to relatively low-plex phenotypic readouts in cancer cell lines in culture, due to limitations associated with in situ sequencing (ISS) of perturbation barcodes. Here, we developed PerturbView, an OPS technology that leverages in vitro transcription (IVT) to amplify barcodes prior to ISS, enabling screens with highly multiplexed phenotypic readouts across diverse systems, including primary cells and tissues. We demonstrate PerturbView in iPSC-derived neurons, primary immune cells, and tumor tissue sections from animal models. In a screen of immune signaling pathways in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, PerturbView uncovered both known and novel regulators of NF{kappa}B signaling. Furthermore, we combined PerturbView with spatial transcriptomics in tissue sections from a mouse xenograft model, paving the way to in vivo screens with rich optical and transcriptomic phenotypes. PerturbView broadens the scope of OPS to a wide range of models and applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent studies have identified over one hundred high-confidence (hc) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes. Systems biological and functional analyses on smaller subsets of these genes have consistently implicated excitatory neurogenesis. However, the extent to which the broader set of hcASD genes are involved in this process has not been explored systematically nor have the biological pathways underlying this convergence been identified. Here, we leveraged CROP-Seq to repress 87 hcASD genes in a human in vitro model of cortical neurogenesis. We identified 17 hcASD genes whose repression significantly alters developmental trajectory and results in a common cellular state characterized by disruptions in proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle, microtubule biology, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We also characterized over 3,000 differentially expressed genes, 286 of which had expression profiles correlated with changes in developmental trajectory. Overall, we uncovered transcriptional disruptions downstream of hcASD gene perturbations, correlated these disruptions with distinct differentiation phenotypes, and reinforced neurogenesis, microtubule biology, and RBPs as convergent points of disruption in ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is well known that the chromatin states play a major role in cell-fate decision and cell-identity maintenance; however, the spatial variation of chromatin states in situ remains poorly characterized. Here, by leveraging recently available spatial-CUT&amp;Tag data, we systematically characterized the global spatial organization of the H3K4me3 profiles in a mouse embryo. Our analysis identified a subset of genes with spatially coherent H3K4me3 patterns, which together delineate the tissue boundaries. The spatially coherent genes are strongly enriched with tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Remarkably, their corresponding genomic loci are marked by broad H3K4me3 domains, which is distinct from the typical H3K4me3 signature. Spatial transition across tissue boundaries is associated with continuous shortening of the broad H3K4me3 domains as well as expansion of H3K27me3 domains. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between the genomic and spatial variation of chromatin states, which may play an important role in embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">What features of transcription can be learnt by fitting mathematical models of gene expression to mRNA count data? Given a suite of models, fitting to data selects an optimal one, thus identifying a probable transcriptional mechanism. Whilst attractive, the utility of this methodology remains unclear. Here, we sample steady-state, single-cell mRNA count distributions from parameters in the physiological range, and show they cannot be used to confidently estimate the number of inactive gene states, i.e. the number of rate-limiting steps in transcriptional initiation. Distributions from over 99% of the parameter space generated using models with 2, 3, or 4 inactive states can be well fit by one with a single inactive state. However, we show that if the mRNA lifetime is hours long, then for many minutes following induction, the increase in the mean mRNA count obeys a power law whose exponent equals the sum of the number of states visited from the initial inactive state to the active state and the number of rate-limiting post-transcriptional processing steps. Our study shows that non-linear regression estimation of the exponent from eukaryotic data is sufficient to estimate the total number of regulatory steps in transcription initiation, splicing, and nuclear export.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Interactions between proteins and metabolites are key for cellular function, from the catalytic breakdown of nutrients to signaling. An important case is cell-cell communication, where cellular metabolites are secreted into the microenvironment and initiate a signaling cascade by binding to an intra- or extracellular receptor of another cell. While protein-protein mediated cell-cell communication is routinely inferred from transcriptomic data, for metabolite-protein interactions this is challenging due to the limitations of high-throughput single-cell and spatial metabolomics technologies, together with the absence of comprehensive prior knowledge resources that include metabolites. Here we report MetalinksDB, a comprehensive and flexible database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions that is a magnitude larger than existing ones. MetalinksDB can be tailored to specific biological contexts such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations by querying subsets of interactions using the web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) or the knowledge graph adapters. We showcase the use of MetalinksDB by identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer patients from multi-omics data as well as inferring metabolite-mediated cell-cell communication events driving acute kidney injury from spatial transcriptomic data. We anticipate that MetalinksDB will facilitate the study of metabolite-mediated communication processes.

        <p class="abstract">Pathological activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is among the most frequent defects in human cancer and is also the cause of rare overgrowth disorders. Yet, there is currently no systematic understanding of the quantitative flow of information within PI3K/AKT signaling and how it is perturbed by disease-causing mutations. Here, we develop scalable, single-cell approaches for systematic analyses of signal processing within the PI3K pathway, enabling precise calculations of its information transfer for different growth factors. Using genetically-engineered human cell models with allele dose-dependent expression of PIK3CAH1047R, we show that this oncogene is not a simple, constitutive pathway activator but a context-dependent modulator of extracellular signal transfer. PIK3CAH1047Rreduces information transmission downstream of IGF1 while selectively enhancing EGF-induced signaling and transcriptional responses. This leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, akin to &#34;blurred&#34; signal perception. The associated increase in signaling heterogeneity promotes phenotypic diversity in a human cervical cancer cell line model and in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Collectively, these findings and the accompanying methodological advances lay the foundations for a systematic mapping of the quantitative mechanisms of PI3K/AKT-dependent signal processing and phenotypic control in health and disease.

One-sentence summarySingle-cell signaling and information theoretic analyses reveal that oncogenic PI3K/AKT activation leads to a gross reduction in signaling specificity, context-dependent EGF response amplification as well as increased phenotypic heterogeneity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which primarily converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. Despite a phenylalanine-deprived diet, many adult PKU patients display deficits of executive functions. These are hypothesised to be caused by high cerebral phenylalanine and a shortage of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Method: To better understand the relationship between plasma and brain amino acid levels and monoaminergic neurotransmitter biochemistry, we constructed a computational model. The model comprises the transport of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) across the blood-brain barrier as well as cerebral amino acid and monoaminergic neurotransmitter metabolism and was validated by direct measurements of brain amino acid concentrations in PKU mice on various diets. Results: The model predicts that brain amino acids are positively controlled by the concentrations of the corresponding amino acids in the blood, and to a lesser extent negatively by other amino acids competing for the transport systems. The model suggests that brain levels of monoaminergic neurotransmitters are controlled more by phenylalanine, probably through non-competitive inhibition of the hydroxylases rather than by their precursor amino acids. Therefore, the model predicts that the decrease of neurotransmitters in PKU cannot be fully rescued by the addition of tyrosine and tryptophan alone, but also benefits from a reduction of the phenylalanine level. Thereby, the model substantiates the experimental data of the synergistic effect of both brain phenylalanine reduction and increased precursor amino acid availability to improve brain neurotransmitters in PKU mice. Conclusion: We present the first complete model of the LNAA transport through the blood-brain barrier and subsequent brain neurotransmitter metabolism in PKU. The model leads to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of individual amino acids in the diet on the underlying brain dysfunction in PKU. Moreover, it identifies gaps in our current knowledge about the LNAA transport across the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the model can be readily applied in studies of other neurological disorders in which the relation between diet, gene activities, brain amino acids, and neurotransmitters is important.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Collective behavior of biological agents such as herds of organisms and cells is a fundamental feature in the systems biology and in the emergence of new phenomena in the biological environ-ment. Collective cell migration under a physical or chemical cue is an example of this fundamental phenomenon where individual cell migration is driven by the collective behavior of the neighboring cells and vice versa. The goal of this research is to discover the mathematical rules of collective cell migration using experimental data and testing the predictive nature of the models in independent experimental data. Such insight is made possible in this work with the hybrid use of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) [1] and optimal control theory. Both single and multi-cellular systems are simulated, including obstacle courses, using this framework. The results of this work show how cells collectively behave during their migration and also, opens the possibility of designing robotic cells for possible therapeutic purpose where the cell trajectory can be controlled.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This research presents a novel approach to biological Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system modeling, combining Residual Networks (ResNet) with symbolic regression techniques. Our methodology is designed to simulate biological systems more realistically than traditional numerical fitting methods. By utilizing logarithmic and exponential functions within the ResNet, our model effectively mirrors manual equation formulation while maintaining compatibility with neural network principles. The models performance was evaluated using data from two distinct studies, demonstrating its ability to accurately capture both linear dynamics and complex, periodic patterns in gene regulatory networks. This innovative approach offers a promising path for exploring systems biology, highlighting the potential of merging diverse methodologies to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Collective behaviors require coordination of individuals. Thus, a population must adjust its phenotypic distribution to adapt to changing environments. How can a population regulate its phenotypic distribution? One strategy is to utilize specialized networks for gene regulation and maintaining distinct phenotypic subsets. Another involves genetic mutations, which can be augmented by stress-response pathways. Here, we studied how a migrating bacterial population regulates its phenotypic distribution to traverse across diverse environments. We generated isogenic Escherichia coli populations with varying distributions of swimming behaviors and observed their phenotype distributions during migration in liquid and porous environments. Surprisingly, we found that during collective migration, the distributions of swimming phenotypes adapt to the environment without mutations or gene regulation. Instead, adaptation is caused by the dynamic and reversible enrichment of high-performing swimming phenotypes within each environment. This adaptation mechanism is supported by a recent theoretical study, which proposed that the phenotypic composition of a migrating population results from a balance between cell growth generating diversity and collective migration eliminating the phenotypes that are unable to keep up with the migrating group. Furthermore, by examining chemoreceptor abundance distributions during migration towards different attractants, we found that this mechanism acts on multiple chemotaxis-related traits simultaneously. Our findings reveal that collective migration itself can enable cell populations with continuous, multi-dimensional phenotypes to flexibly and rapidly adapt their phenotypic composition to diverse environmental conditions.

Significance statementConventional cell adaptation mechanisms, like gene regulation and random phenotypic switching, act swiftly but are limited to a few traits, while mutation-driven adaptations unfold slowly. By quantifying phenotypic diversity during bacterial collective migration, we discovered an adaptation mechanism that rapidly and reversibly adjusts multiple traits simultaneously. By dynamically balancing the elimination of phenotypes unable to keep pace with generation of diversity through growth, this process enables populations to tune their phenotypic composition based on the environment, without the need for gene regulation or mutations. Given the prevalence of collective migration in microbes, cancers, and embryonic development, non-genetic adaptation through collective migration may be a universal mechanism for populations to navigate diverse environments, offering insights into broader applications across various fields.</p>
