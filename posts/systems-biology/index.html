It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals approximately following a power-law, but the exponent of this response varies between promoters. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.\nLIANA+: an all-in-one cell-cell communication framework\nAuthors: Dimitrov, D.; Schäfer, P. S. L.; Farr, E.; Rodriguez Mier, P.; Lobentanzer, S.; Dugourd, A.; Tanevski, J.; Ramirez Flores, R. O.; Saez-Rodriguez, J.\nScore: 52.9, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553863\nThe growing availability of single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomics has led to the rapidly growing popularity of methods to infer cell-cell communication. Many approaches have emerged, each capturing only a partial view of the complex landscape of cell-cell communication. Here, we present LIANA+, a scalable framework to decode coordinated inter- and intracellular signalling events from single- and multi-condition datasets in both single-cell and spatially-resolved data. Beyond integrating and extending established methodologies and a rich knowledge base, LIANA+ enables novel analyses using diverse molecular mediators, including those measured in multi-omics data. Accessible as an open-source Python package at https://github.com/saezlab/liana-py, LIANA+ provides a comprehensive set of synergistic components to study cell-cell communication.

P.; Asif, M. H.; Horvath, S.; Larschan, E.; Singh, R.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554165\nBackgroundAging involves intricate epigenetic changes, with histone modifications playing a pivotal role in dynamically regulating gene expression. Our research comprehensively analyzes seven key histone modifications across various tissues to understand their behavior during human aging and formulate age prediction models. ResultsThese histone-centric prediction models exhibit remarkable accuracy and resilience against experimental and artificial noise. They showcase comparable efficacy when compared with DNA methylation age predictors through simulation experiments. Intriguingly, our gene set enrichment analysis pinpoints vital developmental pathways crucial for age prediction. Unlike in DNA methylation age predictors, genes previously recognized in animal studies as integral to aging are amongst the most important features of our models. We also introduce a pan-histone-mark, pan-tissue age predictor that operates across multiple tissues and histone marks, reinforcing that age-related epigenetic markers are not restricted to particular histone modifications. ConclusionOur findings underscore the potential of histone marks in crafting robust age predictors and shed light on the intricate tapestry of epigenetic alterations in aging.\nOn standardization of controls in lifespan studies\nAuthors: Spiridonova, O.; Kriukov, D.; Nemirovich-Danchenko, N.; Peshkin, L.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.552381\nThe search for interventions to slow down and even reverse aging is a burgeoning field. The literature cites hundreds of supposedly beneficial pharmacological and genetic interventions in model organisms: mice, rats, flies and worms, where research into physiology is routinely accompanied by lifespan data. Naturally the negative results are more frequent, yet scientifically quite valuable if analyzed systematically. Yet, there is a strong \"discovery bias\", i.e. results of interventions which turn out not to be beneficial remain unpublished. Theoretically, all lifespan data is ripe for re-analysis: we could contrast the molecular targets and pathways across studies and help focus the further search for interventions. Alas, the results of most longevity studies are difficult to compare. This is in part because there are no clear, universally accepted standards for conducting such experiments or even for reporting such data. The situation is worsened by the fact that the authors often do not describe experimental conditions completely. As a result, works on longevity make up a set of precedents, each of which might be interesting in its own right, yet incoherent and incomparable. Here we point out specific issues and propose solutions for quality control by checking both inter- and intra-study consistency of lifespan data.\nDynamics of bacterial operons during genome-wide stresses\nAuthors: Jagadeesan, R.; Dash, S.; Palma, C.; Baptista, I. S. C.; Chauhan, V.; Makela, J.; Ribeiro, A. S.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554578\nBacterial gene networks have many operons, each coordinating the kinetics of a few genes in time and strength. In Escherichia coli, nearly half of these operons have internal promoters, which allow regulating the downstream genes, independently from upstream genes. We studied their role during genome-wide stresses targeting a few key elements of the transcription machinery, namely, RNAP and gyrase. We show that absolute differences in response strength between genes in the same operon follow a sinusoidal function of the distance between them. This results from the combined effect of elongation fall-offs and internal promoters. The frequency of this function is regulated by the positioning of internal promoters, while its amplitude differs with the perturbation strength. Moreover, we find that positive supercoiling buildup partially explains the RNAP fall-off rates. Finally, we report similar sinusoidal patterns in E. coli cells subject to several other stresses, as well as in Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Helicobacter pylori. Overall, our results suggest that the strength, number, and positioning of internal promoters in operons are influenced by a genome-wide need to compensate for RNAP fall-offs, and thus provide distal genes in the operon with similar response strength as genes proximal to the primary promoter.\nTranscription factors operate on a limited vocabulary of binding motifs in Arabidopsis thaliana\nAuthors: Zenker, S.; Wulf, D.; Meierhenrich, A.; Becker, S.; Eisenhut, M.; Stracke, R.; Weisshaar, B.; Braeutigam, A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555073\nPredicting gene expression from promoter sequence requires understanding of the different signal integration points within a promoter. Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) binding to their cognate TF binding motifs control gene expression in eukaryotes by activating and repressing transcription. Their interplay generates complex expression patterns in reaction to environmental conditions and developmental cues. We hypothesized that signals are not only integrated by different TFs binding various positions in a promoter, but also by single TF binding motifs onto which multiple TFs can bind. Analyzing 2,190 binding motifs, we identified only 76 core TF binding motifs in plants. Twenty-one TF protein families act highly specific and bind a single conserved motif. Four TF families are classified as semi-conserved as they bind up to four motifs within a family, with divisions along phylogenetic groups. Five TF families bind diverse motifs. Expression analyses revealed high competition within TF families for the same binding motif. The results show that singular binding motifs act as signal integrators in plants where a combination of binding affinity and TF abundance likely determine the output.\nEvaluating single-cell variability in proteasomal decay\nAuthors: Das, S.; Singh, A.; Shah, P.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554358\nGene expression is a stochastic process that leads to variability in mRNA and protein abundances even within an isogenic population of cells grown in the same environment. This variation, often called gene-expression noise, has typically been attributed to transcriptional and translational processes while ignoring the contributions of protein decay variability across cells. Here we estimate the single-cell protein decay rates of two degron GFPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using time-lapse microscopy. We find substantial cell-to-cell variability in the decay rates of the degron GFPs. We evaluate cellular features that explain the variability in the proteasomal decay and find that the amount of 20s catalytic beta subunit of the proteasome marginally explains the observed variability in the degron GFP half-lives. We propose alternate hypotheses that might explain the observed variability in the decay of the two degron GFPs. Overall, our study highlights the importance of studying the kinetics of the decay process at single-cell resolution and that decay rates vary at the single-cell level, and that the decay process is stochastic. A complex model of decay dynamics must be included when modeling stochastic gene expression to estimate gene expression noise.\nReverse engineering morphogenesis through Bayesian optimization of physics-based models\nAuthors: Kumar, N.; Dowling, A.; Zartman, J. J.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553928\nMorphogenetic programs direct the cell signaling and nonlinear mechanical interactions between multiple cell types and tissue layers to define organ shape and size. A key challenge for systems and synthetic biology is determining optimal combinations of intra- and inter-cellular interactions to predict an organs shape, size, and function. Physics-based mechanistic models that define the subcellular force distribution facilitate this, but it is extremely challenging to calibrate parameters in these models from data. To solve this inverse problem, we created a Bayesian optimization framework to determine the optimal cellular force distribution such that the predicted organ shapes match the desired organ shapes observed within the experimental imaging data. This integrative framework employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a non-parametric kernel-based probabilistic machine learning modeling paradigm, to learn the mapping functions relating to the morphogenetic programs that generate and maintain the final organ shape. We calibrated and tested the method on cross-sections of Drosophila wing imaginal discs, a highly informative model organ system, to study mechanisms that regulate epithelial processes that range from development to cancer. As a specific test case, the parameter estimation framework successfully infers the underlying changes in core parameters needed to match simulation data with time series imaging data of wing discs perturbed with collagenase. Unexpectedly, the framework also identifies multiple distinct parameter sets that generate shapes similar to wild-type organ shapes. This platform enables an efficient, global sensitivity analysis to support the necessity of both actomyosin contractility and basal ECM stiffness to generate and maintain the curved shape of the wing imaginal disc. The optimization framework, combined with fixed tissue imaging, identified that Piezo, a mechanosensitive ion channel, impacts fold formation by regulating the apical-basal balance of actomyosin contractility and elasticity of ECM. This framework is extensible toward reverse-engineering the morphogenesis of any organ system and can be utilized in real-time control of complex multicellular systems.\nThe interplay between lumen pressure and cell proliferation determines organoid morphology in a multicellular phase field model\nAuthors: Tanida, S.; Fuji, K.; Lu, L.; Guyomar, T.; Lee, B. H.; Honigmann, A.; Grapin-Botton, A.; Riveline, D.; Nonomura, M.; Sano, M.; Hiraiwa, T.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553655\nOrganoids are ideal systems to predict the phenotypes of organs. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the generalized rules that enable use of simple cellular principles to make morphological predictions of entire organoids. Therefore, we employed a phase field model with the following basic components: the minimum conditions for the timing and volume of cell division, lumen nucleation rules, and lumenal pressure. Through our model, we could compute and generate a myriad of organoid phenotypes observed till date. We propose morphological indices necessary to characterize the shapes and construct phase diagrams and show their dependencies on proliferation time and lumen pressure. Additionally, we introduced the lumen-index parameter, which helped in examining the criteria to maintain organoids as spherical structures comprising a single layer of cells and enclosing an intact lumen. Finally, we predict a star-like organoid phenotype that did not undergo differentiation, suggesting that the volume constraint during cell division may determine the final phenotype. In summary, our approach provides researchers with guidelines to test the mechanisms of self-organization and predict the shape of organoid. Author summaryIn nature, a wide variety of organ morphologies are observed. Owing to the complexity of the process underlying the acquisition of organs morphology, it is challenging to investigate the mechanisms that lead to such variations. A promising approach to study these variations is the use of \"computational organoid\" study, which is the computational-based study of self-organizing shapes in multicellular assemblies and fluid-filled cavities called lumens that develop from a few proliferating cells. This study explores general mechanisms that dictate how various mechanical factors affect the growing self-organized multicellular assembly. We relied on computer simulations of the mathematical model called multicellular phase-field model with lumens and explored the mechanical factor effects, such as the lumen pressure while considering the time and volume conditions required for cell division. These simulations generated and categorized a wide range of organoid phenotypes based on the varying lumen pressure and cell division conditions. These phenotypes were characterized into seven distinct classes, based on the morphological index sets, including a cellular monolayer/multilayer surrounding single or multiple lumens and branch formation. These phenotypes were obtained without the assumption of differentiation. Our study elucidates the mechanisms underlying the organoid and organ formation with different shapes, thereby highlighting the significance of mechanical forces in shaping these complex biological structures.\nAn amortized approach to non-linear mixed-effects modeling based on neural posterior estimation\nAuthors: Arruda, J.; Schalte, Y.; Peiter, C.; Teplytska, O.; Jaehde, U.; Hasenauer, J.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554273\nNon-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering. However, fitting these models to data is computationally challenging if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural density estimation based on normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for an efficient inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its scalability to large data sets in an unprecedented manner. Moreover, we show that it enables accurate uncertainty quantification and extends to stochastic models, which established methods, such as SAEM and FOCEI are unable to handle. Thus, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the analysis capabilities for heterogeneous populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Genes are often regulated by multiple enhancers. It is poorly understood how the individual enhancer activities are combined to control promoter activity. Anecdotal evidence has shown that enhancers can combine sub-additively, additively, synergistically, or redundantly. However, it is not clear which of these modes are more frequent in mammalian genomes. Here, we systematically tested how pairs of enhancers activate promoters using a three-way combinatorial reporter assay in mouse cells. By assaying about 69,000 enhancer-enhancer-promoter combinations we found that enhancer pairs generally combine near-additively. This behaviour was conserved across seven developmental promoters tested. Surprisingly, these promoters scale the enhancer signals approximately following a power-law, but the exponent of this response varies between promoters. A housekeeping promoter showed an overall different response to enhancer pairs, and a smaller dynamic range. Thus, our data indicate that enhancers mostly act additively, but promoters transform their collective effect non-linearly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The growing availability of single-cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomics has led to the rapidly growing popularity of methods to infer cell-cell communication. Many approaches have emerged, each capturing only a partial view of the complex landscape of cell-cell communication.

Here, we present LIANA&#43;, a scalable framework to decode coordinated inter- and intracellular signalling events from single- and multi-condition datasets in both single-cell and spatially-resolved data. Beyond integrating and extending established methodologies and a rich knowledge base, LIANA&#43; enables novel analyses using diverse molecular mediators, including those measured in multi-omics data. Accessible as an open-source Python package at https://github.com/saezlab/liana-py, LIANA&#43; provides a comprehensive set of synergistic components to study cell-cell communication.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAging involves intricate epigenetic changes, with histone modifications playing a pivotal role in dynamically regulating gene expression. Our research comprehensively analyzes seven key histone modifications across various tissues to understand their behavior during human aging and formulate age prediction models.

ResultsThese histone-centric prediction models exhibit remarkable accuracy and resilience against experimental and artificial noise. They showcase comparable efficacy when compared with DNA methylation age predictors through simulation experiments. Intriguingly, our gene set enrichment analysis pinpoints vital developmental pathways crucial for age prediction. Unlike in DNA methylation age predictors, genes previously recognized in animal studies as integral to aging are amongst the most important features of our models. We also introduce a pan-histone-mark, pan-tissue age predictor that operates across multiple tissues and histone marks, reinforcing that age-related epigenetic markers are not restricted to particular histone modifications.

ConclusionOur findings underscore the potential of histone marks in crafting robust age predictors and shed light on the intricate tapestry of epigenetic alterations in aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The search for interventions to slow down and even reverse aging is a burgeoning field. The literature cites hundreds of supposedly beneficial pharmacological and genetic interventions in model organisms: mice, rats, flies and worms, where research into physiology is routinely accompanied by lifespan data. Naturally the negative results are more frequent, yet scientifically quite valuable if analyzed systematically. Yet, there is a strong &#34;discovery bias&#34;, i.e. results of interventions which turn out not to be beneficial remain unpublished. Theoretically, all lifespan data is ripe for re-analysis: we could contrast the molecular targets and pathways across studies and help focus the further search for interventions. Alas, the results of most longevity studies are difficult to compare. This is in part because there are no clear, universally accepted standards for conducting such experiments or even for reporting such data. The situation is worsened by the fact that the authors often do not describe experimental conditions completely. As a result, works on longevity make up a set of precedents, each of which might be interesting in its own right, yet incoherent and incomparable. Here we point out specific issues and propose solutions for quality control by checking both inter- and intra-study consistency of lifespan data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterial gene networks have many operons, each coordinating the kinetics of a few genes in time and strength. In Escherichia coli, nearly half of these operons have internal promoters, which allow regulating the downstream genes, independently from upstream genes. We studied their role during genome-wide stresses targeting a few key elements of the transcription machinery, namely, RNAP and gyrase. We show that absolute differences in response strength between genes in the same operon follow a sinusoidal function of the distance between them. This results from the combined effect of elongation fall-offs and internal promoters. The frequency of this function is regulated by the positioning of internal promoters, while its amplitude differs with the perturbation strength. Moreover, we find that positive supercoiling buildup partially explains the RNAP fall-off rates. Finally, we report similar sinusoidal patterns in E. coli cells subject to several other stresses, as well as in Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Helicobacter pylori. Overall, our results suggest that the strength, number, and positioning of internal promoters in operons are influenced by a genome-wide need to compensate for RNAP fall-offs, and thus provide distal genes in the operon with similar response strength as genes proximal to the primary promoter.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predicting gene expression from promoter sequence requires understanding of the different signal integration points within a promoter. Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) binding to their cognate TF binding motifs control gene expression in eukaryotes by activating and repressing transcription. Their interplay generates complex expression patterns in reaction to environmental conditions and developmental cues. We hypothesized that signals are not only integrated by different TFs binding various positions in a promoter, but also by single TF binding motifs onto which multiple TFs can bind. Analyzing 2,190 binding motifs, we identified only 76 core TF binding motifs in plants. Twenty-one TF protein families act highly specific and bind a single conserved motif. Four TF families are classified as semi-conserved as they bind up to four motifs within a family, with divisions along phylogenetic groups. Five TF families bind diverse motifs. Expression analyses revealed high competition within TF families for the same binding motif. The results show that singular binding motifs act as signal integrators in plants where a combination of binding affinity and TF abundance likely determine the output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gene expression is a stochastic process that leads to variability in mRNA and protein abundances even within an isogenic population of cells grown in the same environment. This variation, often called gene-expression noise, has typically been attributed to transcriptional and translational processes while ignoring the contributions of protein decay variability across cells. Here we estimate the single-cell protein decay rates of two degron GFPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using time-lapse microscopy. We find substantial cell-to-cell variability in the decay rates of the degron GFPs. We evaluate cellular features that explain the variability in the proteasomal decay and find that the amount of 20s catalytic beta subunit of the proteasome marginally explains the observed variability in the degron GFP half-lives. We propose alternate hypotheses that might explain the observed variability in the decay of the two degron GFPs. Overall, our study highlights the importance of studying the kinetics of the decay process at single-cell resolution and that decay rates vary at the single-cell level, and that the decay process is stochastic. A complex model of decay dynamics must be included when modeling stochastic gene expression to estimate gene expression noise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenetic programs direct the cell signaling and nonlinear mechanical interactions between multiple cell types and tissue layers to define organ shape and size. A key challenge for systems and synthetic biology is determining optimal combinations of intra- and inter-cellular interactions to predict an organs shape, size, and function. Physics-based mechanistic models that define the subcellular force distribution facilitate this, but it is extremely challenging to calibrate parameters in these models from data. To solve this inverse problem, we created a Bayesian optimization framework to determine the optimal cellular force distribution such that the predicted organ shapes match the desired organ shapes observed within the experimental imaging data. This integrative framework employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a non-parametric kernel-based probabilistic machine learning modeling paradigm, to learn the mapping functions relating to the morphogenetic programs that generate and maintain the final organ shape. We calibrated and tested the method on cross-sections of Drosophila wing imaginal discs, a highly informative model organ system, to study mechanisms that regulate epithelial processes that range from development to cancer. As a specific test case, the parameter estimation framework successfully infers the underlying changes in core parameters needed to match simulation data with time series imaging data of wing discs perturbed with collagenase. Unexpectedly, the framework also identifies multiple distinct parameter sets that generate shapes similar to wild-type organ shapes. This platform enables an efficient, global sensitivity analysis to support the necessity of both actomyosin contractility and basal ECM stiffness to generate and maintain the curved shape of the wing imaginal disc. The optimization framework, combined with fixed tissue imaging, identified that Piezo, a mechanosensitive ion channel, impacts fold formation by regulating the apical-basal balance of actomyosin contractility and elasticity of ECM. This framework is extensible toward reverse-engineering the morphogenesis of any organ system and can be utilized in real-time control of complex multicellular systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids are ideal systems to predict the phenotypes of organs. However, there is currently a lack of understanding regarding the generalized rules that enable use of simple cellular principles to make morphological predictions of entire organoids. Therefore, we employed a phase field model with the following basic components: the minimum conditions for the timing and volume of cell division, lumen nucleation rules, and lumenal pressure. Through our model, we could compute and generate a myriad of organoid phenotypes observed till date. We propose morphological indices necessary to characterize the shapes and construct phase diagrams and show their dependencies on proliferation time and lumen pressure. Additionally, we introduced the lumen-index parameter, which helped in examining the criteria to maintain organoids as spherical structures comprising a single layer of cells and enclosing an intact lumen. Finally, we predict a star-like organoid phenotype that did not undergo differentiation, suggesting that the volume constraint during cell division may determine the final phenotype. In summary, our approach provides researchers with guidelines to test the mechanisms of self-organization and predict the shape of organoid.

Author summaryIn nature, a wide variety of organ morphologies are observed. Owing to the complexity of the process underlying the acquisition of organs morphology, it is challenging to investigate the mechanisms that lead to such variations. A promising approach to study these variations is the use of &#34;computational organoid&#34; study, which is the computational-based study of self-organizing shapes in multicellular assemblies and fluid-filled cavities called lumens that develop from a few proliferating cells. This study explores general mechanisms that dictate how various mechanical factors affect the growing self-organized multicellular assembly. We relied on computer simulations of the mathematical model called multicellular phase-field model with lumens and explored the mechanical factor effects, such as the lumen pressure while considering the time and volume conditions required for cell division. These simulations generated and categorized a wide range of organoid phenotypes based on the varying lumen pressure and cell division conditions. These phenotypes were characterized into seven distinct classes, based on the morphological index sets, including a cellular monolayer/multilayer surrounding single or multiple lumens and branch formation. These phenotypes were obtained without the assumption of differentiation. Our study elucidates the mechanisms underlying the organoid and organ formation with different shapes, thereby highlighting the significance of mechanical forces in shaping these complex biological structures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering. However, fitting these models to data is computationally challenging if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural density estimation based on normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for an efficient inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its scalability to large data sets in an unprecedented manner. Moreover, we show that it enables accurate uncertainty quantification and extends to stochastic models, which established methods, such as SAEM and FOCEI are unable to handle. Thus, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves the analysis capabilities for heterogeneous populations.</p>
