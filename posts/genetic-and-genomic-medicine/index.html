However, the extent to which they share genetic influences remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GWAS data, involving nearly 1 million cases across ten neurological diseases and ten psychiatric disorders, to compare their common genetic risk and biological underpinnings. Using complementary statistical tools, we demonstrate extensive genetic overlap across the disorders, with varying degrees of genetic correlations. In particular, migraine, essential tremor, stroke and multiple sclerosis were genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. Biological interrogation indicated heterogenous biological processes associated with neurological diseases, while psychiatric disorders consistently implicated neuronal biology. Altogether, the study demonstrates that neurological and psychiatric disorders are not genetically disparate, but share key etiological aspects, which have important implications for disease classification, clinical practice, and genomic precision medicine.\nUnraveling COVID-19 Relationship with Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms\nAuthors: Asgel, Z.; Kouakou, M.; Koller, D.; Pathak, G. A.; Cabrera-Mendoza, B.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23293001\nBackgroundWhile COVID-19 outcomes are associated with increased anxiety, individuals affected by anxiety disorders are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsWe used genome-wide data from UK Biobank (up to 420,531 participants), FinnGen Project (up to 329,077 participants), Million Veteran Program (175,163 participants), and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (up to 122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls) to investigate possible causal effects and shared genetic mechanisms linking COVID-19 outcomes to anxiety disorders and symptoms. ResultsWe observed a strong genetic correlation of anxiety disorder with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.35, p=2 x 10-4) and COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.31, p=7.2 x 10-4). Among anxiety symptoms, \"Tense, sore, or aching muscles during worst period of anxiety\" was genetically correlated with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.33, p=0.001), while \"Frequent trouble falling or staying asleep during worst period of anxiety\" was genetically correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.24, p=0.004). Through a latent causal variable analysis, we observed that COVID-19 outcomes have statistically significant genetic causality proportion (gcp) on anxiety symptoms (e.g., COVID-19 positive status[-\u0026gt;]\"Recent easy annoyance or irritability\" [boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.18, p=6.72 x 10-17). Conversely, anxiety disorders appear to have a possible causal effect on COVID-19 ([boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.38, p=3.17 x 10-9). Additionally, we also identified multiple loci with evidence of local genetic correlation between anxiety and COVID-19. These appear to be related to genetic effects shared with lung function, brain morphology, alcohol and tobacco use, and hematologic parameters. ConclusionsThis study provided important insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health, differentiating the dynamics linking anxiety disorders to COVID-19 from the effect of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms.\nCalibrated prediction intervals for polygenic scores across diverse contexts\nAuthors: Hou, K.; Xu, Z.; Ding, Y.; Harpak, A.; Pasaniuc, B.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293056\nPolygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields from agriculture to personalized medicine. We analyze data from two large biobanks in the US (All of Us) and the UK (UK Biobank) to find widespread variability in PGS performance across contexts. Many contexts, including age, sex, and income, impact PGS accuracies with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. PGSs trained in single versus multi-ancestry cohorts show similar context-specificity in their accuracies. We introduce trait prediction intervals that are allowed to vary across contexts as a principled approach to account for context-specific PGS accuracy in genomic prediction. We model the impact of all contexts in a joint framework to enable PGS-based trait predictions that are well-calibrated (contain the trait value with 90% probability in all contexts), whereas methods that ignore context are mis-calibrated. We show that prediction intervals need to be adjusted for all considered traits ranging from 10% for diastolic blood pressure to 80% for waist circumference. Adjustment of prediction intervals depends on the dataset; for example, prediction intervals for education years need to be adjusted by 90% in All of Us versus 8% in UK Biobank. Our results provide a path forward towards utilization of PGS as a prediction tool across all individuals regardless of their contexts while highlighting the importance of comprehensive profile of context information in study design and data collection.\nA SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS OF COPY NUMBER LOSSES OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nAuthors: Burghel, G. J.; Ellingford, J. M.; Wright, R.; Bradford, L.; Miller, J.; Watt, C.; Edgerley, J.; Naeem, F.; Banka, S.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.23292123\nBackgroundRe-analysis of whole exome/genome data improves diagnostic yield. However, the value of re-analysis of clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) data has never been investigated. Case-by-case re-analysis is impractical in busy diagnostic laboratories. Methods and ResultsWe harmonised historical post-natal clinical aCGH results from [~]16,000 patients tested via our diagnostic laboratory over [~]7 years with current clinical guidance. This led to identification of 33,857 benign, 2,173 class 3, and 979 pathogenic copy number losses (CNLs). We found benign CNLs to be significantly less likely to encompass haploinsufficient genes compared to the pathogenic or class 3 CNLs in our database. Using this observation, we developed a re-analysis pipeline (using up-to-date disease association data and haploinsufficiency scores) and shortlisted 207 class 3 CNLs encompassing at least one autosomal dominant disease-gene associated with haploinsufficiency or loss-of-function mechanism. Clinical scientist review led to reclassification of 7.2% shortlisted class 3 CNLs as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This included first cases of CNV-mediated disease for some genes where all previously described cases involved only point variants. Interestingly, some CNLs could not be re-classified because the phenotypes of patients with CNLs seemed distinct from the known clinical features resulting from point variants, thus raising questions about accepted underlying disease mechanisms. Several potential novel disease-genes were identified that would need further validation. ConclusionsRe-analysis of clinical aCGH data increases diagnostic yield and demonstrates their research value. In future, the aCGH reanalysis program should be expanded to include other copy number variant types.\nIdentifying risk genes for embryo aneuploidy using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing\nAuthors: Sun, S.; Aboelenain, M.; Ariad, D.; Haywood, M.; Wageman, C.; Duke, M.; Bag, A.; Viotti, M.; Katz-Jaffe, M.; McCoy, R.; Schindler, K.; Xing, J.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.23292618\nBackgroundAneuploidy, the state of a cell containing extra or missing chromosomes, frequently arises during human meiosis and is the primary cause of early miscarriage and maternal age-related in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. IVF patients exhibit significant variability in aneuploidy rates, although the exact genetic causes of the variability in aneuploid egg production remain unclear. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (ulc-WGS) is a standard test for identifying and selecting IVF-derived embryos with a normal chromosome complement. The wealth of embryo aneuploidy data and ulc-WGS data from PGT-A has potential for discovering variants in paternal genomes that are associated with aneuploidy risk in their embryos. MethodsUsing ulc-WGS data from [~]10,000 PGT-A biopsies, we imputed genotype likelihoods of genetic variants in parental genomes. We then used the imputed variants and aneuploidy calls from the embryos to perform a genome-wide association study of aneuploidy incidence. Finally, we carried out functional evaluation of the identified candidate gene in a mouse oocyte system. ResultsWe identified one locus on chromosome 3 that is significantly associated with maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. One candidate gene, CCDC66, encompassed by this locus, is involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Using mouse oocytes, we showed that CCDC66 regulates meiotic progression and chromosome segregation fidelity, especially in older mice. ConclusionsOur work extended the research utility of PGT-A ulc-WGS data by allowing robust association testing and improved the understanding of the genetic contribution to maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. Importantly, we introduce a generalizable method that can be leveraged for similar association studies using ulc-WGS data.\nGenetic Risk Factors for Severe and Fatigue Dominant Long COVID and Commonalities with ME/CFS Identified by Combinatorial Analysis\nAuthors: Taylor, K.; Pearson, M.; Das, S.; Sardell, J.; Chocian, K.; Gardner, S.\nScore: 50.3, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292611\nBackgroundLong COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other conditions such as ME/CFS that present with similar symptoms. MethodsWe used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics Long COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms. ResultsCombinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3. Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank. Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS. ConclusionThis study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential treatment options in long COVID.\nFederated analysis of the contribution of recessive coding variants to 29,745 developmental disorder patients from diverse populations\nAuthors: Chundru, V. K.; Zhang, Z.; Walter, K.; Lindsay, S.; Danecek, P.; Eberhardt, R. Y.; Gardner, E. J.; Malawsky, D. S.; Wigdor, E. M.; Torene, R.; Retterer, K.; Wright, C. F.; McWalter, K.; Sheridan, E.; Firth, H. V.; Hurles, M. E.; Samocha, K. E.; Ustach, V. D.; Martin, H. C.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293070\nAutosomal recessive (AR) coding variants are a well-known cause of rare disorders. We quantified the contribution of these variants to developmental disorders (DDs) in the largest and most ancestrally diverse sample to date, comprising 29,745 trios from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and the genetic diagnostics company GeneDx, of whom 20.4% have genetically-inferred non-European ancestries. The estimated fraction of patients attributable to exome-wide AR coding variants ranged from [~]2% to [~]18% across genetically-inferred ancestry groups, and was significantly correlated with the average autozygosity (r=0.99, p=5x10-6). Established AR DD-associated (ARDD) genes explained 90% of the total AR coding burden, and this was not significantly different between probands with genetically-inferred European versus non-European ancestries. Approximately half the burden in these established genes was explained by variants not already reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. We estimated that [~]1% of undiagnosed patients in both cohorts were attributable to damaging biallelic genotypes involving missense variants in established ARDD genes, highlighting the challenge in interpreting these. By testing for gene-specific enrichment of damaging biallelic genotypes, we identified two novel ARDD genes passing Bonferroni correction, KBTBD2 (p=1x10-7) and CRELD1 (p=9x10-8). Several other novel or recently-reported candidate genes were identified at a more lenient 5% false-discovery rate, including ZDHHC16 and HECTD4. This study expands our understanding of the genetic architecture of DDs across diverse genetically-inferred ancestry groups and suggests that improving strategies for interpreting missense variants in known ARDD genes may allow us to diagnose more patients than discovering the remaining genes.\nA novel gene-screening approach reveals QSOX1/IL1RAP as promising biomarkers for the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nAuthors: Ma, W.; Huang, J.; Cai, B.; Shao, M.; Yu, X.; Kjaer, M. B.; Lv, M.; Zhong, X.; Xu, S.; Zhan, B.; Li, Q.; Huang, Q.; Ma, M.; Cheng, L.; Luo, Y.; Gronbaek, H.; Zhou, X.; Lin, L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.23293038\nBackground and AimsNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease that ranges from simple steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. To address the unmet need for new NAFLD biomarkers, we aimed to identify candidate biomarkers using publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics data. MethodsA novel approach involving unsupervised gene clustering was performed using homogeneously processed and integrated RNA-seq data of 625 liver specimens to screen for NAFLD biomarkers in combination with public proteomics data from healthy controls and NAFLD patients. Additionally, we validated the results in the NAFLD and healthy cohorts using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of plasma and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of liver samples. ResultsWe generated a database (https://dreamapp.biomed.au.dk/NAFLD/) for exploring gene expression changes along NAFLD progression to facilitate the identification of genes and pathways involved in the diseases progression. Through cross-analysis of the gene and protein clusters, we identified 38 genes as potential biomarkers for NAFLD severity. Up-regulation of Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) and down-regulation of Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) were associated with increasing NAFLD severity in RNA-seq and proteomics data. Remarkably, the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio in plasma demonstrated effectiveness in diagnosing NAFLD, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of up to 0.95 as quantified by proteomics profiling and an AUROC of 0.82 with ELISA. ConclusionsWe discovered a significant association between the levels of QSOX1/IL1RAP and NAFLD severity. Furthermore, the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio shows promise as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing NAFLD and assessing its severity. (ChiCTR2300073940). Lay SummaryThis study aimed to find non-invasive biomarkers for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Researchers utilized a new gene clustering method to analyze RNA-seq data from 625 liver samples. The identified biomarkers were further validated using plasma proteomics profiling, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and liver immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in three separate groups of healthy controls and NAFLD patients. The study revealed that the levels of QSOX1 were elevated while IL1RAP levels were reduced with increasing severity of NAFLD. Notably, the ratio of QSOX1 to IL1RAP expression in plasma showed promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing the severity of NAFLD, eliminating the reliance on liver biopsy. HighlightsO_LIRNA-seq data from 625 liver specimens comprising healthy controls and NAFLD patients with increasing severity were utilized for screening NAFLD biomarkers. C_LIO_LIA novel unsupervised method for clustering genes based on the similarity of gene expression across each sample enhanced the discovery of novel effective non-invasive NAFLD biomarkers. C_LIO_LIQSOX1, IL1RAP, and especially the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio, were found to be associated with NAFLD severity. C_LIO_LIThe high sensitivity of the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio in predicting NAFLD severity was validated with plasma proteomics quantification (AUROC = 0.95) and ELISA (AUROC = 0.82) in two independent patient cohorts.

J. E.; Bathe, O.; Kaasa, S.; Strasser, F.; Gagnon, B.; Baracos, V. E.; Damaraju, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293083\nBackgroundCancer cachexia is characterized by severe loss of muscle and fat involving a complex interplay of host-tumor interactions. While much emphasis has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with cachexia, understanding the heritable component of cachexia remains less explored. The current study aims to identify Copy Number Variants (CNV) as genetic susceptibility determinants for weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia using genome wide association study (GWAS) approach. MethodsA total of 174 age-matched patients with esophagogastric or lung cancer were classified as weight losing (\u003e10% weight loss) or weight stable participants (\u003c2% weight loss). DNA was genotyped using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to profile CNVs. We tested CNVs with \u003e5% frequency in the population for association with weight loss. Pathway analysis was performed using the genes embedded within CNVs. To understand if the CNVs in the present study are also expressed in skeletal muscle of patients with cachexia, we utilized two publicly available human gene expression datasets to infer the relevance of identified genes in the context of cachexia. ResultsAmong the associated CNVs, 5414 CNVs had embedded protein coding genes. Of these, 1583 CNVs were present at \u003e5% frequency. We combined multiple contiguous CNVs within the same genomic region and called them Copy Number Variable Region (CNVR). This led to identifying 896 non-redundant CNV/CNVRs which encompassed 803 protein coding genes. Genes embedded within CNVs were enriched for several pathways implicated in cachexia and muscle wasting including JAK-STAT signaling, Oncostatin M signaling, Wnt signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling. This is the first proof of principle GWAS study to identify CNVs as genetic determinants for cancer cachexia. Further, we show that a subset of CNV/CNVR embedded genes identified in the current study are common with the previously published skeletal muscle gene expression datasets, indicating that expression of CNV/CNVR genes in muscle may have functional consequences in patients with cachexia These genes include CPT1B, SPON1, LOXL1, NFAT5, RBFOX1 and PCSK6 to name a few. ConclusionThis is the first proof of principle GWAS study to identify CNVs as genetic determinants for cancer cachexia. The data generated will aid in future replication studies in larger cohorts to account for genetic susceptibility to weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia.\nAssociation study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nAuthors: Guillen-Guio, B.; Paynton, M.

Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of the HLA-DQB1 gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk. MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association threshold p\u003c4.5x10-4 and a posterior probability of replication \u003e90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reported HLA-DQB1 association in the subset of studies independent of the original report. ResultsThe meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. The HLA-DQB1 association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies. ConclusionVariation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Neurological and psychiatric disorders are considered to reflect distinct underlying pathogenic entities. However, the extent to which they share genetic influences remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GWAS data, involving nearly 1 million cases across ten neurological diseases and ten psychiatric disorders, to compare their common genetic risk and biological underpinnings. Using complementary statistical tools, we demonstrate extensive genetic overlap across the disorders, with varying degrees of genetic correlations. In particular, migraine, essential tremor, stroke and multiple sclerosis were genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. Biological interrogation indicated heterogenous biological processes associated with neurological diseases, while psychiatric disorders consistently implicated neuronal biology. Altogether, the study demonstrates that neurological and psychiatric disorders are not genetically disparate, but share key etiological aspects, which have important implications for disease classification, clinical practice, and genomic precision medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWhile COVID-19 outcomes are associated with increased anxiety, individuals affected by anxiety disorders are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsWe used genome-wide data from UK Biobank (up to 420,531 participants), FinnGen Project (up to 329,077 participants), Million Veteran Program (175,163 participants), and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (up to 122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls) to investigate possible causal effects and shared genetic mechanisms linking COVID-19 outcomes to anxiety disorders and symptoms.

ResultsWe observed a strong genetic correlation of anxiety disorder with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.35, p=2 x 10-4) and COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.31, p=7.2 x 10-4). Among anxiety symptoms, &#34;Tense, sore, or aching muscles during worst period of anxiety&#34; was genetically correlated with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.33, p=0.001), while &#34;Frequent trouble falling or staying asleep during worst period of anxiety&#34; was genetically correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.24, p=0.004). Through a latent causal variable analysis, we observed that COVID-19 outcomes have statistically significant genetic causality proportion (gcp) on anxiety symptoms (e.g., COVID-19 positive status[-&amp;gt;]&#34;Recent easy annoyance or irritability&#34; [boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.18, p=6.72 x 10-17). Conversely, anxiety disorders appear to have a possible causal effect on COVID-19 ([boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.38, p=3.17 x 10-9). Additionally, we also identified multiple loci with evidence of local genetic correlation between anxiety and COVID-19. These appear to be related to genetic effects shared with lung function, brain morphology, alcohol and tobacco use, and hematologic parameters.

ConclusionsThis study provided important insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health, differentiating the dynamics linking anxiety disorders to COVID-19 from the effect of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields from agriculture to personalized medicine. We analyze data from two large biobanks in the US (All of Us) and the UK (UK Biobank) to find widespread variability in PGS performance across contexts. Many contexts, including age, sex, and income, impact PGS accuracies with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. PGSs trained in single versus multi-ancestry cohorts show similar context-specificity in their accuracies. We introduce trait prediction intervals that are allowed to vary across contexts as a principled approach to account for context-specific PGS accuracy in genomic prediction. We model the impact of all contexts in a joint framework to enable PGS-based trait predictions that are well-calibrated (contain the trait value with 90% probability in all contexts), whereas methods that ignore context are mis-calibrated. We show that prediction intervals need to be adjusted for all considered traits ranging from 10% for diastolic blood pressure to 80% for waist circumference. Adjustment of prediction intervals depends on the dataset; for example, prediction intervals for education years need to be adjusted by 90% in All of Us versus 8% in UK Biobank. Our results provide a path forward towards utilization of PGS as a prediction tool across all individuals regardless of their contexts while highlighting the importance of comprehensive profile of context information in study design and data collection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRe-analysis of whole exome/genome data improves diagnostic yield. However, the value of re-analysis of clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) data has never been investigated. Case-by-case re-analysis is impractical in busy diagnostic laboratories.

Methods and ResultsWe harmonised historical post-natal clinical aCGH results from [~]16,000 patients tested via our diagnostic laboratory over [~]7 years with current clinical guidance. This led to identification of 33,857 benign, 2,173 class 3, and 979 pathogenic copy number losses (CNLs). We found benign CNLs to be significantly less likely to encompass haploinsufficient genes compared to the pathogenic or class 3 CNLs in our database. Using this observation, we developed a re-analysis pipeline (using up-to-date disease association data and haploinsufficiency scores) and shortlisted 207 class 3 CNLs encompassing at least one autosomal dominant disease-gene associated with haploinsufficiency or loss-of-function mechanism. Clinical scientist review led to reclassification of 7.2% shortlisted class 3 CNLs as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This included first cases of CNV-mediated disease for some genes where all previously described cases involved only point variants. Interestingly, some CNLs could not be re-classified because the phenotypes of patients with CNLs seemed distinct from the known clinical features resulting from point variants, thus raising questions about accepted underlying disease mechanisms. Several potential novel disease-genes were identified that would need further validation.

ConclusionsRe-analysis of clinical aCGH data increases diagnostic yield and demonstrates their research value. In future, the aCGH reanalysis program should be expanded to include other copy number variant types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAneuploidy, the state of a cell containing extra or missing chromosomes, frequently arises during human meiosis and is the primary cause of early miscarriage and maternal age-related in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. IVF patients exhibit significant variability in aneuploidy rates, although the exact genetic causes of the variability in aneuploid egg production remain unclear. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (ulc-WGS) is a standard test for identifying and selecting IVF-derived embryos with a normal chromosome complement. The wealth of embryo aneuploidy data and ulc-WGS data from PGT-A has potential for discovering variants in paternal genomes that are associated with aneuploidy risk in their embryos.

MethodsUsing ulc-WGS data from [~]10,000 PGT-A biopsies, we imputed genotype likelihoods of genetic variants in parental genomes. We then used the imputed variants and aneuploidy calls from the embryos to perform a genome-wide association study of aneuploidy incidence. Finally, we carried out functional evaluation of the identified candidate gene in a mouse oocyte system.

ResultsWe identified one locus on chromosome 3 that is significantly associated with maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. One candidate gene, CCDC66, encompassed by this locus, is involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Using mouse oocytes, we showed that CCDC66 regulates meiotic progression and chromosome segregation fidelity, especially in older mice.

ConclusionsOur work extended the research utility of PGT-A ulc-WGS data by allowing robust association testing and improved the understanding of the genetic contribution to maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. Importantly, we introduce a generalizable method that can be leveraged for similar association studies using ulc-WGS data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other conditions such as ME/CFS that present with similar symptoms.

MethodsWe used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics Long COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms.

ResultsCombinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases.

Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3.

Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank.

Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential treatment options in long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autosomal recessive (AR) coding variants are a well-known cause of rare disorders. We quantified the contribution of these variants to developmental disorders (DDs) in the largest and most ancestrally diverse sample to date, comprising 29,745 trios from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and the genetic diagnostics company GeneDx, of whom 20.4% have genetically-inferred non-European ancestries. The estimated fraction of patients attributable to exome-wide AR coding variants ranged from [~]2% to [~]18% across genetically-inferred ancestry groups, and was significantly correlated with the average autozygosity (r=0.99, p=5x10-6). Established AR DD-associated (ARDD) genes explained 90% of the total AR coding burden, and this was not significantly different between probands with genetically-inferred European versus non-European ancestries. Approximately half the burden in these established genes was explained by variants not already reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. We estimated that [~]1% of undiagnosed patients in both cohorts were attributable to damaging biallelic genotypes involving missense variants in established ARDD genes, highlighting the challenge in interpreting these. By testing for gene-specific enrichment of damaging biallelic genotypes, we identified two novel ARDD genes passing Bonferroni correction, KBTBD2 (p=1x10-7) and CRELD1 (p=9x10-8). Several other novel or recently-reported candidate genes were identified at a more lenient 5% false-discovery rate, including ZDHHC16 and HECTD4. This study expands our understanding of the genetic architecture of DDs across diverse genetically-inferred ancestry groups and suggests that improving strategies for interpreting missense variants in known ARDD genes may allow us to diagnose more patients than discovering the remaining genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive liver disease that ranges from simple steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. To address the unmet need for new NAFLD biomarkers, we aimed to identify candidate biomarkers using publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics data.

MethodsA novel approach involving unsupervised gene clustering was performed using homogeneously processed and integrated RNA-seq data of 625 liver specimens to screen for NAFLD biomarkers in combination with public proteomics data from healthy controls and NAFLD patients. Additionally, we validated the results in the NAFLD and healthy cohorts using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of plasma and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of liver samples.

ResultsWe generated a database (https://dreamapp.biomed.au.dk/NAFLD/) for exploring gene expression changes along NAFLD progression to facilitate the identification of genes and pathways involved in the diseases progression. Through cross-analysis of the gene and protein clusters, we identified 38 genes as potential biomarkers for NAFLD severity. Up-regulation of Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) and down-regulation of Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) were associated with increasing NAFLD severity in RNA-seq and proteomics data. Remarkably, the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio in plasma demonstrated effectiveness in diagnosing NAFLD, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of up to 0.95 as quantified by proteomics profiling and an AUROC of 0.82 with ELISA.

ConclusionsWe discovered a significant association between the levels of QSOX1/IL1RAP and NAFLD severity. Furthermore, the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio shows promise as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing NAFLD and assessing its severity. (ChiCTR2300073940).

Lay SummaryThis study aimed to find non-invasive biomarkers for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Researchers utilized a new gene clustering method to analyze RNA-seq data from 625 liver samples. The identified biomarkers were further validated using plasma proteomics profiling, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and liver immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in three separate groups of healthy controls and NAFLD patients. The study revealed that the levels of QSOX1 were elevated while IL1RAP levels were reduced with increasing severity of NAFLD. Notably, the ratio of QSOX1 to IL1RAP expression in plasma showed promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing the severity of NAFLD, eliminating the reliance on liver biopsy.

HighlightsO_LIRNA-seq data from 625 liver specimens comprising healthy controls and NAFLD patients with increasing severity were utilized for screening NAFLD biomarkers.
C_LIO_LIA novel unsupervised method for clustering genes based on the similarity of gene expression across each sample enhanced the discovery of novel effective non-invasive NAFLD biomarkers.
C_LIO_LIQSOX1, IL1RAP, and especially the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio, were found to be associated with NAFLD severity.
C_LIO_LIThe high sensitivity of the QSOX1/IL1RAP ratio in predicting NAFLD severity was validated with plasma proteomics quantification (AUROC = 0.95) and ELISA (AUROC = 0.82) in two independent patient cohorts.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCancer cachexia is characterized by severe loss of muscle and fat involving a complex interplay of host-tumor interactions. While much emphasis has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with cachexia, understanding the heritable component of cachexia remains less explored. The current study aims to identify Copy Number Variants (CNV) as genetic susceptibility determinants for weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia using genome wide association study (GWAS) approach.

MethodsA total of 174 age-matched patients with esophagogastric or lung cancer were classified as weight losing (&gt;10% weight loss) or weight stable participants (&lt;2% weight loss). DNA was genotyped using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays to profile CNVs. We tested CNVs with &gt;5% frequency in the population for association with weight loss. Pathway analysis was performed using the genes embedded within CNVs. To understand if the CNVs in the present study are also expressed in skeletal muscle of patients with cachexia, we utilized two publicly available human gene expression datasets to infer the relevance of identified genes in the context of cachexia.

ResultsAmong the associated CNVs, 5414 CNVs had embedded protein coding genes. Of these, 1583 CNVs were present at &gt;5% frequency. We combined multiple contiguous CNVs within the same genomic region and called them Copy Number Variable Region (CNVR). This led to identifying 896 non-redundant CNV/CNVRs which encompassed 803 protein coding genes. Genes embedded within CNVs were enriched for several pathways implicated in cachexia and muscle wasting including JAK-STAT signaling, Oncostatin M signaling, Wnt signaling and PI3K-Akt signaling. This is the first proof of principle GWAS study to identify CNVs as genetic determinants for cancer cachexia. Further, we show that a subset of CNV/CNVR embedded genes identified in the current study are common with the previously published skeletal muscle gene expression datasets, indicating that expression of CNV/CNVR genes in muscle may have functional consequences in patients with cachexia These genes include CPT1B, SPON1, LOXL1, NFAT5, RBFOX1 and PCSK6 to name a few.

ConclusionThis is the first proof of principle GWAS study to identify CNVs as genetic determinants for cancer cachexia. The data generated will aid in future replication studies in larger cohorts to account for genetic susceptibility to weight loss in patients with cancer cachexia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial pneumonia marked by progressive lung fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of the HLA-DQB1 gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk.

MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association threshold p&lt;4.5x10-4 and a posterior probability of replication &gt;90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reported HLA-DQB1 association in the subset of studies independent of the original report.

ResultsThe meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. The HLA-DQB1 association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies.

ConclusionVariation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF.</p>
