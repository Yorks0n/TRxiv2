K.; Zhang, Z.; Walter, K.; Lindsay, S.; Danecek, P.; Eberhardt, R. Y.; Gardner, E. J.; Malawsky, D. S.; Wigdor, E. M.; Torene, R.; Retterer, K.; Wright, C. F.; McWalter, K.; Sheridan, E.; Firth, H. V.; Hurles, M. E.; Samocha, K. E.; Ustach, V. D.; Martin, H. C.\nScore: 27.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293070\nAutosomal recessive (AR) coding variants are a well-known cause of rare disorders. We quantified the contribution of these variants to developmental disorders (DDs) in the largest and most ancestrally diverse sample to date, comprising 29,745 trios from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and the genetic diagnostics company GeneDx, of whom 20.4% have genetically-inferred non-European ancestries. The estimated fraction of patients attributable to exome-wide AR coding variants ranged from [~]2% to [~]18% across genetically-inferred ancestry groups, and was significantly correlated with the average autozygosity (r=0.99, p=5x10-6). Established AR DD-associated (ARDD) genes explained 90% of the total AR coding burden, and this was not significantly different between probands with genetically-inferred European versus non-European ancestries. Approximately half the burden in these established genes was explained by variants not already reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. We estimated that [~]1% of undiagnosed patients in both cohorts were attributable to damaging biallelic genotypes involving missense variants in established ARDD genes, highlighting the challenge in interpreting these. By testing for gene-specific enrichment of damaging biallelic genotypes, we identified two novel ARDD genes passing Bonferroni correction, KBTBD2 (p=1x10-7) and CRELD1 (p=9x10-8). Several other novel or recently-reported candidate genes were identified at a more lenient 5% false-discovery rate, including ZDHHC16 and HECTD4. This study expands our understanding of the genetic architecture of DDs across diverse genetically-inferred ancestry groups and suggests that improving strategies for interpreting missense variants in known ARDD genes may allow us to diagnose more patients than discovering the remaining genes.\nGenome-wide analyses reveal widespread genetic overlap between neurological and psychiatric disorders and a convergence of biological associations related to the brain\nAuthors: Smeland, O. B.; Kutrolli, G.; Bahrami, S.; Fominykh, V.; Parker, N.; Hindley, G.; Rodevand, L.; Jaholkowski, P.; Tesfaye, M.; Parekh, P.; Elvsaashagen, T.; Grotzinger, A. D.; The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), ; The International Headache Genetics Consortium (IHGC), ; Steen, N. E.; van der Meer, D.; O'Connell, K. S.; Djurovic, S. D.; Dale, A.; Shadrin, A.; Frei, O.; Andreassen, O.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292993\nNeurological and psychiatric disorders are considered to reflect distinct underlying pathogenic entities. However, the extent to which they share genetic influences remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GWAS data, involving nearly 1 million cases across ten neurological diseases and ten psychiatric disorders, to compare their common genetic risk and biological underpinnings. Using complementary statistical tools, we demonstrate extensive genetic overlap across the disorders, with varying degrees of genetic correlations. In particular, migraine, essential tremor, stroke and multiple sclerosis were genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. Biological interrogation indicated heterogenous biological processes associated with neurological diseases, while psychiatric disorders consistently implicated neuronal biology. Altogether, the study demonstrates that neurological and psychiatric disorders are not genetically disparate, but share key etiological aspects, which have important implications for disease classification, clinical practice, and genomic precision medicine.\nA SYSTEMATIC RE-ANALYSIS OF COPY NUMBER LOSSES OF UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nAuthors: Burghel, G. J.; Ellingford, J. M.; Wright, R.; Bradford, L.; Miller, J.; Watt, C.; Edgerley, J.; Naeem, F.; Banka, S.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.23292123\nBackgroundRe-analysis of whole exome/genome data improves diagnostic yield. However, the value of re-analysis of clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) data has never been investigated. Case-by-case re-analysis is impractical in busy diagnostic laboratories. Methods and ResultsWe harmonised historical post-natal clinical aCGH results from [~]16,000 patients tested via our diagnostic laboratory over [~]7 years with current clinical guidance. This led to identification of 33,857 benign, 2,173 class 3, and 979 pathogenic copy number losses (CNLs). We found benign CNLs to be significantly less likely to encompass haploinsufficient genes compared to the pathogenic or class 3 CNLs in our database. Using this observation, we developed a re-analysis pipeline (using up-to-date disease association data and haploinsufficiency scores) and shortlisted 207 class 3 CNLs encompassing at least one autosomal dominant disease-gene associated with haploinsufficiency or loss-of-function mechanism. Clinical scientist review led to reclassification of 7.2% shortlisted class 3 CNLs as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This included first cases of CNV-mediated disease for some genes where all previously described cases involved only point variants. Interestingly, some CNLs could not be re-classified because the phenotypes of patients with CNLs seemed distinct from the known clinical features resulting from point variants, thus raising questions about accepted underlying disease mechanisms. Several potential novel disease-genes were identified that would need further validation. ConclusionsRe-analysis of clinical aCGH data increases diagnostic yield and demonstrates their research value. In future, the aCGH reanalysis program should be expanded to include other copy number variant types.\nGenome-wide Association Study of Long COVID\nAuthors: Lammi, V.; Nakanishi, T.; Jones, S.

Similarly, infection by SARS-CoV-2 can result in Long COVID, a condition characterized by symptoms of fatigue and pulmonary and cognitive dysfunction3-5. The biological mechanisms that contribute to the development of Long COVID remain to be clarified. We leveraged the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative6, 7 to perform a genome-wide association study for Long COVID including up to 6,450 Long COVID cases and 1,093,995 population controls from 24 studies across 16 countries. We identified the first genome-wide significant association for Long COVID at the FOXP4 locus. FOXP4 has been previously associated with COVID-19 severity6, lung function8, and cancers9, suggesting a broader role for lung function in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. While we identify COVID-19 severity as a causal risk factor for Long COVID, the impact of the genetic risk factor located in the FOXP4 locus could not be solely explained by its association to severe COVID-19. Our findings further support the role of pulmonary dysfunction and COVID-19 severity in the development of Long COVID.\nAssociation study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nAuthors: Guillen-Guio, B.; Paynton, M.

R.; Oldha\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292940\nIntroductionIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial pneumonia marked by progressive lung fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of the HLA-DQB1 gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk. MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association threshold p\u003c4.5x10-4 and a posterior probability of replication \u003e90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reported HLA-DQB1 association in the subset of studies independent of the original report. ResultsThe meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. The HLA-DQB1 association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies. ConclusionVariation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF.\nUnraveling COVID-19 Relationship with Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms\nAuthors: Asgel, Z.; Kouakou, M.; Koller, D.; Pathak, G. A.; Cabrera-Mendoza, B.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23293001\nBackgroundWhile COVID-19 outcomes are associated with increased anxiety, individuals affected by anxiety disorders are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsWe used genome-wide data from UK Biobank (up to 420,531 participants), FinnGen Project (up to 329,077 participants), Million Veteran Program (175,163 participants), and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (up to 122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls) to investigate possible causal effects and shared genetic mechanisms linking COVID-19 outcomes to anxiety disorders and symptoms. ResultsWe observed a strong genetic correlation of anxiety disorder with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.35, p=2 x 10-4) and COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.31, p=7.2 x 10-4). Among anxiety symptoms, \"Tense, sore, or aching muscles during worst period of anxiety\" was genetically correlated with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.33, p=0.001), while \"Frequent trouble falling or staying asleep during worst period of anxiety\" was genetically correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.24, p=0.004). Through a latent causal variable analysis, we observed that COVID-19 outcomes have statistically significant genetic causality proportion (gcp) on anxiety symptoms (e.g., COVID-19 positive status[-\u0026gt;]\"Recent easy annoyance or irritability\" [boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.18, p=6.72 x 10-17). Conversely, anxiety disorders appear to have a possible causal effect on COVID-19 ([boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.38, p=3.17 x 10-9). Additionally, we also identified multiple loci with evidence of local genetic correlation between anxiety and COVID-19. These appear to be related to genetic effects shared with lung function, brain morphology, alcohol and tobacco use, and hematologic parameters. ConclusionsThis study provided important insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health, differentiating the dynamics linking anxiety disorders to COVID-19 from the effect of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms.\nGenetic Risk Factors for Severe and Fatigue Dominant Long COVID and Commonalities with ME/CFS Identified by Combinatorial Analysis\nAuthors: Taylor, K.; Pearson, M.; Das, S.; Sardell, J.; Chocian, K.; Gardner, S.\nScore: 48.5, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292611\nBackgroundLong COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other conditions such as ME/CFS that present with similar symptoms. MethodsWe used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics Long COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms. ResultsCombinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3. Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank. Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS. ConclusionThis study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential treatment options in long COVID.\nIdentifying risk genes for embryo aneuploidy using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing\nAuthors: Sun, S.; Aboelenain, M.; Ariad, D.; Haywood, M.; Wageman, C.; Duke, M.; Bag, A.; Viotti, M.; Katz-Jaffe, M.; McCoy, R.; Schindler, K.; Xing, J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.23292618\nBackgroundAneuploidy, the state of a cell containing extra or missing chromosomes, frequently arises during human meiosis and is the primary cause of early miscarriage and maternal age-related in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. IVF patients exhibit significant variability in aneuploidy rates, although the exact genetic causes of the variability in aneuploid egg production remain unclear. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (ulc-WGS) is a standard test for identifying and selecting IVF-derived embryos with a normal chromosome complement. The wealth of embryo aneuploidy data and ulc-WGS data from PGT-A has potential for discovering variants in paternal genomes that are associated with aneuploidy risk in their embryos. MethodsUsing ulc-WGS data from [~]10,000 PGT-A biopsies, we imputed genotype likelihoods of genetic variants in parental genomes. We then used the imputed variants and aneuploidy calls from the embryos to perform a genome-wide association study of aneuploidy incidence. Finally, we carried out functional evaluation of the identified candidate gene in a mouse oocyte system. ResultsWe identified one locus on chromosome 3 that is significantly associated with maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. One candidate gene, CCDC66, encompassed by this locus, is involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Using mouse oocytes, we showed that CCDC66 regulates meiotic progression and chromosome segregation fidelity, especially in older mice. ConclusionsOur work extended the research utility of PGT-A ulc-WGS data by allowing robust association testing and improved the understanding of the genetic contribution to maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. Importantly, we introduce a generalizable method that can be leveraged for similar association studies using ulc-WGS data.\nCalibrated prediction intervals for polygenic scores across diverse contexts\nAuthors: Hou, K.; Xu, Z.; Ding, Y.; Harpak, A.; Pasaniuc, B.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293056\nPolygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields from agriculture to personalized medicine. We analyze data from two large biobanks in the US (All of Us) and the UK (UK Biobank) to find widespread variability in PGS performance across contexts. Many contexts, including age, sex, and income, impact PGS accuracies with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. PGSs trained in single versus multi-ancestry cohorts show similar context-specificity in their accuracies. We introduce trait prediction intervals that are allowed to vary across contexts as a principled approach to account for context-specific PGS accuracy in genomic prediction. We model the impact of all contexts in a joint framework to enable PGS-based trait predictions that are well-calibrated (contain the trait value with 90% probability in all contexts), whereas methods that ignore context are mis-calibrated. We show that prediction intervals need to be adjusted for all considered traits ranging from 10% for diastolic blood pressure to 80% for waist circumference. Adjustment of prediction intervals depends on the dataset; for example, prediction intervals for education years need to be adjusted by 90% in All of Us versus 8% in UK Biobank. Our results provide a path forward towards utilization of PGS as a prediction tool across all individuals regardless of their contexts while highlighting the importance of comprehensive profile of context information in study design and data collection.\nSubset scanning for multi-trait analysis using GWAS summary statistics\nAuthors: Cao, R.; Olawsky, E.; McFowland, E.; Marcotte, E.; Spector, L.; Yang, T.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292708\nMulti-trait analysis has been shown to have greater statistical power than single-trait analysis. Most of the existing multi-trait analysis methods only work with a limited number of traits and usually prioritize high statistical power over identifying relevant traits, which heavily rely on domain knowledge. To handle diseases and traits with obscure etiology, we developed TraitScan, a powerful and fast algorithm that agnostically searches and tests a subset of traits from a moderate or large number of traits (e.g., dozens to thousands) based on either individual-level or summary-level genetic data. We evaluated TraitScan using extensive simulations and found that it outperformed existing methods in terms of both testing power and trait selection when sparsity was low or modest. We then applied it to search for traits associated with Ewing Sarcoma, a rare bone tumor with peak onset in adolescence, among 706 traits in UK Biobank. Our analysis revealed a few promising traits worthy of further investigation, highlighting the use of TraitScan for more effective multi-trait analysis as biobanks emerge. Our algorithm is implemented in an R package TraitScan available at https://github.com/RuiCao34/TraitScan.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Autosomal recessive (AR) coding variants are a well-known cause of rare disorders. We quantified the contribution of these variants to developmental disorders (DDs) in the largest and most ancestrally diverse sample to date, comprising 29,745 trios from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and the genetic diagnostics company GeneDx, of whom 20.4% have genetically-inferred non-European ancestries. The estimated fraction of patients attributable to exome-wide AR coding variants ranged from [~]2% to [~]18% across genetically-inferred ancestry groups, and was significantly correlated with the average autozygosity (r=0.99, p=5x10-6). Established AR DD-associated (ARDD) genes explained 90% of the total AR coding burden, and this was not significantly different between probands with genetically-inferred European versus non-European ancestries. Approximately half the burden in these established genes was explained by variants not already reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. We estimated that [~]1% of undiagnosed patients in both cohorts were attributable to damaging biallelic genotypes involving missense variants in established ARDD genes, highlighting the challenge in interpreting these. By testing for gene-specific enrichment of damaging biallelic genotypes, we identified two novel ARDD genes passing Bonferroni correction, KBTBD2 (p=1x10-7) and CRELD1 (p=9x10-8). Several other novel or recently-reported candidate genes were identified at a more lenient 5% false-discovery rate, including ZDHHC16 and HECTD4. This study expands our understanding of the genetic architecture of DDs across diverse genetically-inferred ancestry groups and suggests that improving strategies for interpreting missense variants in known ARDD genes may allow us to diagnose more patients than discovering the remaining genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurological and psychiatric disorders are considered to reflect distinct underlying pathogenic entities. However, the extent to which they share genetic influences remains unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GWAS data, involving nearly 1 million cases across ten neurological diseases and ten psychiatric disorders, to compare their common genetic risk and biological underpinnings. Using complementary statistical tools, we demonstrate extensive genetic overlap across the disorders, with varying degrees of genetic correlations. In particular, migraine, essential tremor, stroke and multiple sclerosis were genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders. Biological interrogation indicated heterogenous biological processes associated with neurological diseases, while psychiatric disorders consistently implicated neuronal biology. Altogether, the study demonstrates that neurological and psychiatric disorders are not genetically disparate, but share key etiological aspects, which have important implications for disease classification, clinical practice, and genomic precision medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRe-analysis of whole exome/genome data improves diagnostic yield. However, the value of re-analysis of clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) data has never been investigated. Case-by-case re-analysis is impractical in busy diagnostic laboratories.

Methods and ResultsWe harmonised historical post-natal clinical aCGH results from [~]16,000 patients tested via our diagnostic laboratory over [~]7 years with current clinical guidance. This led to identification of 33,857 benign, 2,173 class 3, and 979 pathogenic copy number losses (CNLs). We found benign CNLs to be significantly less likely to encompass haploinsufficient genes compared to the pathogenic or class 3 CNLs in our database. Using this observation, we developed a re-analysis pipeline (using up-to-date disease association data and haploinsufficiency scores) and shortlisted 207 class 3 CNLs encompassing at least one autosomal dominant disease-gene associated with haploinsufficiency or loss-of-function mechanism. Clinical scientist review led to reclassification of 7.2% shortlisted class 3 CNLs as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This included first cases of CNV-mediated disease for some genes where all previously described cases involved only point variants. Interestingly, some CNLs could not be re-classified because the phenotypes of patients with CNLs seemed distinct from the known clinical features resulting from point variants, thus raising questions about accepted underlying disease mechanisms. Several potential novel disease-genes were identified that would need further validation.

ConclusionsRe-analysis of clinical aCGH data increases diagnostic yield and demonstrates their research value. In future, the aCGH reanalysis program should be expanded to include other copy number variant types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Infections can lead to persistent or long-term symptoms and diseases such as shingles after varicella zoster, cancers after human papillomavirus, or rheumatic fever after streptococcal infections1, 2. Similarly, infection by SARS-CoV-2 can result in Long COVID, a condition characterized by symptoms of fatigue and pulmonary and cognitive dysfunction3-5. The biological mechanisms that contribute to the development of Long COVID remain to be clarified. We leveraged the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative6, 7 to perform a genome-wide association study for Long COVID including up to 6,450 Long COVID cases and 1,093,995 population controls from 24 studies across 16 countries. We identified the first genome-wide significant association for Long COVID at the FOXP4 locus. FOXP4 has been previously associated with COVID-19 severity6, lung function8, and cancers9, suggesting a broader role for lung function in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. While we identify COVID-19 severity as a causal risk factor for Long COVID, the impact of the genetic risk factor located in the FOXP4 locus could not be solely explained by its association to severe COVID-19. Our findings further support the role of pulmonary dysfunction and COVID-19 severity in the development of Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial pneumonia marked by progressive lung fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF and a prior association of the HLA-DQB1 gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Due to the important role that the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk.

MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising a total of 5,159 cases and 27,459 controls, including the prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association threshold p&lt;4.5x10-4 and a posterior probability of replication &gt;90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reported HLA-DQB1 association in the subset of studies independent of the original report.

ResultsThe meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. The HLA-DQB1 association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies.

ConclusionVariation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWhile COVID-19 outcomes are associated with increased anxiety, individuals affected by anxiety disorders are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes.

MethodsWe used genome-wide data from UK Biobank (up to 420,531 participants), FinnGen Project (up to 329,077 participants), Million Veteran Program (175,163 participants), and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (up to 122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls) to investigate possible causal effects and shared genetic mechanisms linking COVID-19 outcomes to anxiety disorders and symptoms.

ResultsWe observed a strong genetic correlation of anxiety disorder with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.35, p=2 x 10-4) and COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.31, p=7.2 x 10-4). Among anxiety symptoms, &#34;Tense, sore, or aching muscles during worst period of anxiety&#34; was genetically correlated with COVID-19 positive status (rg=0.33, p=0.001), while &#34;Frequent trouble falling or staying asleep during worst period of anxiety&#34; was genetically correlated with COVID-19 hospitalization (rg=0.24, p=0.004). Through a latent causal variable analysis, we observed that COVID-19 outcomes have statistically significant genetic causality proportion (gcp) on anxiety symptoms (e.g., COVID-19 positive status[-&amp;gt;]&#34;Recent easy annoyance or irritability&#34; [boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.18, p=6.72 x 10-17). Conversely, anxiety disorders appear to have a possible causal effect on COVID-19 ([boxv]gcp[boxv]=0.38, p=3.17 x 10-9). Additionally, we also identified multiple loci with evidence of local genetic correlation between anxiety and COVID-19. These appear to be related to genetic effects shared with lung function, brain morphology, alcohol and tobacco use, and hematologic parameters.

ConclusionsThis study provided important insights into the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health, differentiating the dynamics linking anxiety disorders to COVID-19 from the effect of COVID-19 on anxiety symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other conditions such as ME/CFS that present with similar symptoms.

MethodsWe used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics Long COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms.

ResultsCombinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases.

Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3.

Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank.

Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential treatment options in long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAneuploidy, the state of a cell containing extra or missing chromosomes, frequently arises during human meiosis and is the primary cause of early miscarriage and maternal age-related in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. IVF patients exhibit significant variability in aneuploidy rates, although the exact genetic causes of the variability in aneuploid egg production remain unclear. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) using ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (ulc-WGS) is a standard test for identifying and selecting IVF-derived embryos with a normal chromosome complement. The wealth of embryo aneuploidy data and ulc-WGS data from PGT-A has potential for discovering variants in paternal genomes that are associated with aneuploidy risk in their embryos.

MethodsUsing ulc-WGS data from [~]10,000 PGT-A biopsies, we imputed genotype likelihoods of genetic variants in parental genomes. We then used the imputed variants and aneuploidy calls from the embryos to perform a genome-wide association study of aneuploidy incidence. Finally, we carried out functional evaluation of the identified candidate gene in a mouse oocyte system.

ResultsWe identified one locus on chromosome 3 that is significantly associated with maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. One candidate gene, CCDC66, encompassed by this locus, is involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Using mouse oocytes, we showed that CCDC66 regulates meiotic progression and chromosome segregation fidelity, especially in older mice.

ConclusionsOur work extended the research utility of PGT-A ulc-WGS data by allowing robust association testing and improved the understanding of the genetic contribution to maternal meiotic aneuploidy risk. Importantly, we introduce a generalizable method that can be leveraged for similar association studies using ulc-WGS data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Polygenic scores (PGS) have emerged as the tool of choice for genomic prediction in a wide range of fields from agriculture to personalized medicine. We analyze data from two large biobanks in the US (All of Us) and the UK (UK Biobank) to find widespread variability in PGS performance across contexts. Many contexts, including age, sex, and income, impact PGS accuracies with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. PGSs trained in single versus multi-ancestry cohorts show similar context-specificity in their accuracies. We introduce trait prediction intervals that are allowed to vary across contexts as a principled approach to account for context-specific PGS accuracy in genomic prediction. We model the impact of all contexts in a joint framework to enable PGS-based trait predictions that are well-calibrated (contain the trait value with 90% probability in all contexts), whereas methods that ignore context are mis-calibrated. We show that prediction intervals need to be adjusted for all considered traits ranging from 10% for diastolic blood pressure to 80% for waist circumference. Adjustment of prediction intervals depends on the dataset; for example, prediction intervals for education years need to be adjusted by 90% in All of Us versus 8% in UK Biobank. Our results provide a path forward towards utilization of PGS as a prediction tool across all individuals regardless of their contexts while highlighting the importance of comprehensive profile of context information in study design and data collection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multi-trait analysis has been shown to have greater statistical power than single-trait analysis. Most of the existing multi-trait analysis methods only work with a limited number of traits and usually prioritize high statistical power over identifying relevant traits, which heavily rely on domain knowledge. To handle diseases and traits with obscure etiology, we developed TraitScan, a powerful and fast algorithm that agnostically searches and tests a subset of traits from a moderate or large number of traits (e.g., dozens to thousands) based on either individual-level or summary-level genetic data. We evaluated TraitScan using extensive simulations and found that it outperformed existing methods in terms of both testing power and trait selection when sparsity was low or modest. We then applied it to search for traits associated with Ewing Sarcoma, a rare bone tumor with peak onset in adolescence, among 706 traits in UK Biobank. Our analysis revealed a few promising traits worthy of further investigation, highlighting the use of TraitScan for more effective multi-trait analysis as biobanks emerge. Our algorithm is implemented in an R package  TraitScan available at https://github.com/RuiCao34/TraitScan.</p>
