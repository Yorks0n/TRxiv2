G.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301439\nSmall particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) is a recognized driver of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among non-smoking individuals. Inhaled PM2.5 recruits pro-inflammatory macrophages to the air-lung interface, which promotes malignant lung epithelial cell growth and progression to overt cancer. We sought to determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common age-related condition characterized by hyperinflammatory macrophages, exacerbates PM2.5-associated NSCLC in non-smokers using genetic, environmental, and phenotypic data from 413,901 individuals in the UK Biobank. Among non-smokers, PM2.5 is not associated with NSCLC and not associated with prevalence of CHIP, but CHIP is associated with a doubling of NSCLC risk (hazard ratio (HR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-3.00). Moreover, CHIP-associated NSCLC risk is exacerbated in the setting of above-median PM2.5 levels (HR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.60-4.55). PM2.5 x CHIP is also associated with significantly greater markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}) than expected. Altogether, these results suggest CHIP and PM2.5 form a novel gene x environment interaction promoting NSCLC tumorigenesis in non-smokers.\nConcordance of whole-genome amplified embryonic DNA with the subsequently born child\nAuthors: Li, S.; Giardina, T.; Katz, M.; Chandramohan, D.; Slotnick, N.; Behr, B.; Siddiqui, N.; Xia, Y.; Podgursky, B.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301086\nBefore implantation subsequent to in vitro fertilization (IVF), the current options for Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) are PGT for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) and, if clinically indicated, PGT for monogenic conditions (PGT-M). A more comprehensive approach involves PGT whole genome sequencing (PGT-WGS). PGT-WGS incorporates PGT-A, screens for hundreds of monogenic conditions, and can evaluate polygenic risk. Here we compare PGT-WGS results against the genome of the subsequently born child. We demonstrated high levels of concordance (both in sensitivity and precision) in exome variant calls between amplified embryonic DNA and sequenced fetal cord blood. This concordance was higher when filtering against 1300 targeted monogenic conditions implicated in birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and hereditary cancer. To evaluate PGT-WGSs ability to identify de novo variants we compared the childs genome to parental genomes and demonstrated that PGT-WGS successfully identified 5/5 confirmed de-novo variants. We further demonstrated concordance in polygenic risk scores calculated for both the embryo and the subsequently born child. This agreement extended to both traditional polygenic scores and oligogenic scores (Type 1 diabetes, Celiac disease, and Alzheimers Disease), which heavily rely on accurate genotyping of HLA and APOE sites. To our knowledge, this is the first direct concordance study between a whole-genome sequencing of a trophectoderm biopsy and the DNA of the subsequently born child. By demonstrating a high degree of whole-exome concordance and adept detection of de novo variants, this approach showcases PGT-WGSs capability to identify genetic variants not explicitly targeted for monogenic screening.\nEarly detection of malignant and pre-malignant peripheral nerve tumors using cell-free DNA fragmentomics\nAuthors: Sundby, R. T.; Szymanski, J. J.; Pan, A.; Jones, P. A.; Mahmood, S. Z.; Reid, O. H.; Srihari, D.; Armstrong, A. E.; Chamberlain, S.; Burgic, S.; Weekley, K.; Murray, B.; Patel, S.; Lucas, A.

A.; Shern, J. F.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301053\nEarly detection of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) informs clinical decision-making, potentially averting deadly outcomes. Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Overall, this study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients using plasma cfDNA fragmentomics. In addition to screening applications, this novel approach distinguishes atypical neurofibromas from benign plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management.\nAn Oxford Nanopore Technology-Based Hepatitis B Virus Sequencing Protocol Suitable For Genomic Surveillance Within Clinical Diagnostic Settings.\nAuthors: Tshiabuila, D.; Choga, W.; San, J. E.; Maponga, T.; Preiser, W.; van Zyl, G.; Moir, M.; van Wyk, S.; Giandhari, J.; Pillay, S.; Anyaneji, U. J.; Lessells, R.; Naidoo, Y.; Sanko, T. J.; Wilkinson, E.; Tegally, H.; Baxter, C.; Martin, D.; de Oliveira, T.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.19.24301519\nChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant public health concern, particularly in Africa, where there is a substantial. HBV is an enveloped virus, with isolates being classified into ten phylogenetically distinct genotypes (A - J) determined based on full-genome sequence data or reverse hybridization-based diagnostic tests. In practice, limitations are noted in that diagnostic sequencing, generally using Sanger sequencing, tends to focus only on the S-gene, yielding little or no information on intra-patient HBV genetic diversity with very low-frequency variants and reverse hybridization detects only known genotype-specific mutations. To resolve these limitations, we developed an Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)-based HBV genotyping protocol suitable for clinical virology, yielding complete HBV genome sequences and extensive data on intra-patient HBV diversity. Specifically, the protocol involves tiling-based PCR amplification of HBV sequences, library preparation using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit, ONT GridION sequencing, genotyping using Genome Detective software, recombination analysis using jpHMM and RDP5 software, and drug resistance profiling using Geno2pheno software. We prove the utility of our protocol by efficiently generating and characterizing high-quality near full-length HBV genomes from 148 left-over diagnostic Hepatitis B patient samples obtained in the Western Cape province of South Africa, providing valuable insights into the genetic diversity and epidemiology of HBV in this region of the world.\nBreaking down causes, consequences, and mediating effects of age-related telomere shortening on human health\nAuthors: Moix, S.; Sadler, M. C.; Kutalik, Z.; Auwerx, C.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301196\nTelomeres represent repeated DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, which shorten with each cell division. Factors modulating telomere attrition and the health consequences thereof are not fully understood. To address this, we leveraged data from 326,363 unrelated UK Biobank participants of European ancestry and used linear regression and bidirectional univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR and MVMR) to elucidate the relationships between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and 141 complex traits, including diseases, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. We confirm that telomeres shorten with age and show a stronger decline in males than in females, which cannot be explained by hormonal or lifestyle differences. MR revealed 23 traits modulating LTL; e.g., smoking cessation and high educational attainment associated with longer LTL, while weekly alcohol intake, body mass index, urate levels, and female reproductive events, such as childbirth, associated with shorter LTL. We also identified 26 traits affected by LTL, with risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and some autoimmune diseases being increased by short LTL, while longer LTL increased risk for other autoimmune conditions and cancers. Through MVMR, we show that LTL partially mediates the impact of educational attainment, body mass index, and female age at childbirth on lifespan. These results provide new insights into the biology of telomere regulation by shedding light on the modulators, consequences, and the mediatory role of telomere shortening, portraying an intricate relationship between LTL, diseases, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors.\nPWAS Hub: Exploring Gene-Based Associations of Common Complex Diseases\nAuthors: Kelman, G.; Zucker, R.; Brandes, N.; Linial, M.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.23300645\nPWAS (Proteome-Wide Association Study) is an innovative genetic association approach that complements widely-used methods like GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). The PWAS platform involves consecutive phases. Initially, machine learning modeling and probabilistic considerations quantified the impact of genetic variants on protein-coding genes' biochemical functions. Secondly, aggregating the variants per gene for each individual determines a gene-damaging score. Finally, standard statistical tests are activated in the case-control setting to yield statistically significant genes per phenotype. The PWAS Hub offers a user-friendly interface for an in-depth exploration of gene-disease associations from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results from PWAS cover 99 common diseases and conditions, each with over 10,000 diagnosed individuals per phenotype. Users can explore genes associated with these diseases, with separate analyses conducted for males and females. The PWAS Hub lists statistically significant genes associated with common diseases. It also indicates whether the analyzed damaged gene is associated with an increased or decreased risk. For each phenotype, the analyses account for sex-based genetic effects, inheritance modes (dominant and recessive), and the pleiotropic nature of associated genes. The PWAS Hub showcases its usefulness by navigating through such proteomic-genetic application for asthma. Graphical tools facilitate comparing genetic effects between the results of PWAS and coding GWAS, aiding in understanding the sex-specific genetic impact on common diseases. This adaptable platform is attractive for clinicians, researchers, and individuals interested in delving into gene-disease associations and sex-specific genetic effects.

M.; Falkenberg Smeland, M.; Butler, K. M.; Lyons, M. J.; Carvalho, C. M. B.; Zhang, C.; Lupski, J. R.; Potocki, L.; Flores-Gallegos, L.; Morales-Toquero, R.; Petit, F.; Yalcin, B.; Tuttle, A.; Zghal Elloumi, H.; Mccormick, L.; Kukolich, M.; Klaas, O.; Horvath, J.; Scala, M.; Score: 6.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.24301100\nBackgroundWe previously described the KINSSHIP syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID), mesomelic dysplasia and horseshoe kidney,caused by de novo variants in the degron of AFF3. Mouse knock-ins and overexpression in zebrafish provided evidence for a dominant-negative (DN) mode-of-action, wherein an increased level of AFF3 resulted in pathological effects. MethodsEvolutionary constraints suggest that other mode-of-inheritance could be at play. We challenged this hypothesis by screening ID cohorts for individuals with predicted-to-be deleterious variants in AFF3. We used both animal and cellular models to assess the deleteriousness of the identified variants. ResultsWe identified an individual with a KINSSHIP-like phenotype carrying a de novo partial duplication of AFF3 further strengthening the hypothesis that an increased level of AFF3 is pathological. We also detected seventeen individuals displaying a milder syndrome with either heterozygous LoF or biallelic missense variants in AFF3. Consistent with semi-dominance, we discovered three patients with homozygous LoF and one compound heterozygote for a LoF and a missense variant, who presented more severe phenotypes than their heterozygous parents. Matching zebrafish knockdowns exhibit neurological defects that could be rescued by expressing human AFF3 mRNA, confirming their association with the ablation of aff3. Conversely, some of the human AFF3 mRNAs carrying missense variants identified in affected individuals did not complement. Overexpression of mutated AFF3 mRNAs in zebrafish embryos produced a significant increase of abnormal larvae compared to wild-type overexpression further demonstrating deleteriousness. To further assess the effect of AFF3 variation, we profiled the transcriptome of fibroblasts from affected individuals and engineered isogenic cells harboring +/+, DN/DN, LoF/+, LoF/LoF or DN/LoF AFF3 genotypes. The expression of more than a third of the AFF3 bound loci is modified in either the DN/DN or the LoF/LoF lines. While the same pathways are affected, only about one-third of the differentially expressed genes are common to these homozygote datasets, indicating that AFF3 LoF and DN variants largely modulate transcriptomes differently, e.g. the DNA repair pathway displayed opposite modulation. ConclusionsOur results and the high pleiotropy shown by variation at this locus suggest that minute changes in AFF3 function are deleterious.\nIdentifying compounds to treat opiate use disorder by leveraging multi-omic data integration and multiple drug repurposing databases.\nAuthors: Stratford, J. K.; Carnes, M. U.; Willis, C.; Minto, M. S.; Elnimeiry, L.; Mathur, R.; Schu, M.; Quach, B. C.; Carter, J.; Nolen, T.; Vandergrift, N.; Kosten, T. R.; Johnson, E. O.; Webb, B. T.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301329\nGenes influencing opioid use disorder (OUD) biology have been identified via genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene expression, and network analyses. These discoveries provide opportunities to identifying existing compounds targeting these genes for drug repurposing studies. However, systematically integrating discovery results and identifying relevant available pharmacotherapies for OUD repurposing studies is challenging. To address this, weve constructed a framework that leverages existing results and drug databases to identify candidate pharmacotherapies. For this study, two independent OUD related meta-analyses were used including a GWAS and a differential gene expression (DGE) study of post-mortem human brain. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) sub-networks enriched for GWAS risk loci were identified via network analyses. Drug databases Pharos, Open Targets, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and DrugBank were queried for clinical status and target selectivity. Cross-omic and drug query results were then integrated to identify candidate compounds. GWAS and DGE analyses revealed 3 and 335 target genes (FDR q\u003c0.05), respectively, while network analysis detected 70 genes in 22 enriched PPI networks. Four selection strategies were implemented, which yielded between 72 and 676 genes with statistically significant support and 110 to 683 drugs targeting these genes, respectively. After filtering out less specific compounds or those targeting well-established psychiatric-related receptors (OPRM1 and DRD2), between 2 and 329 approved drugs remained across the four strategies. By leveraging multiple lines of biological evidence and resources, we identified many FDA approved drugs that target genes associated with OUD. This approach a) allows high-throughput querying of OUD-related genes, b) detects OUD-related genes and compounds not identified using a single domain or resource, and c) produces a succinct summary of FDA approved compounds eligible for efficient expert review. Identifying larger pools of candidate pharmacotherapies and summarizing the supporting evidence bridges the gap between discovery and drug repurposing studies.\nEHMT2 LOSS-OF-FUNCTION ALTERATIONS CAUSE A KLEEFSTRA-LIKE SYNDROME\nAuthors: Martinez-Delgado, B.; Lopez-Martin, E.; Kerkhof, J.; Baladron, B.; Mielu, L. M.; Sanchez-Ponce, D.; Bada-Navarro, A.; Herrero-Matesanz, M.; Lopez-Jimenez, L.; Rzasa, J.; Rots, D.; Fernandez, M.; Hernandez-San Miguel, E.; Gomez-Mariano, G.; Marin-Reina, P.; Cazorla-Calleja, R.; Alonso, J.; Kleefstra, T.; Posada, M.; Bermejo-Sanchez, E.; Sadikovic, B.; Barrero, M. J.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24300997\nDysregulation of the epigenetic machinery is associated with neurodevelopmental defects in humans. Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by heterozygous alterations in the gene EHMT1 that cause loss-of-function. EHTM1 and EHMT2 are highly similar histone methyltransferases that play relevant roles in development. Despite their similarity, individuals with alterations in EHMT2 have never been described. Here, we describe a pediatric patient with a KS-overlapping phenotype and a single base de novo substitution in EHMT2 that causes the amino acid change p.Ala1077Ser in the catalytic SET domain. This change causes a reduction in the affinity of the catalytic domain for the H3 tail and in the activity of the enzyme by three- to five-fold. DNA methylation, histone methylation and gene expression profiles suggest a significant overlap between the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant and KS. Based on this evidence we suggest that EHMT2 haploinsufficiency causes a Kleefstra-like syndrome. Although we cannot rule out dominant negative effects caused by the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant, our data and previously published data suggest that loss of EHMT2 function is probably more detrimental to cells than loss of EHMT1, explaining why individuals with alterations in EHMT2 are very rare.\nCross-ancestry genetic investigation of schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder, and tobacco smoking\nAuthors: Johnson, E. C.; Austin-Zimmerman, I.; Thorpe, H. H.; Levey, D. F.; Baranger, D. A.; Colbert, S. M. C.; Demontis, D.; Khokhar, J. Y.; Davis, L. K.; Edenberg, H. J.; Di Forti, M.; Sanchez-Roige, S.; Gelernter, J.; Agrawal, A.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301430\nIndividuals with schizophrenia frequently experience co-occurring substance use, including tobacco smoking and heavy cannabis use, and substance use disorders. There is interest in understanding the extent to which these relationships are causal, and to what extent shared genetic factors play a role. We explored the relationships between schizophrenia (Scz), cannabis use disorder (CanUD), and ever-regular tobacco smoking (Smk) using the largest available genome-wide studies of these phenotypes in individuals of African and European ancestries. All three phenotypes were positively genetically correlated (rgs = 0.17 - 0.62).Causal inference analyses suggested the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, but evidence for bidirectional causal relationships was also found between all three phenotypes even after correcting for horizontal pleiotropy. We identified 439 pleiotropic loci in the European ancestry data, 150 of which were novel (i.e., not genome-wide significant in the original studies). Of these pleiotropic loci, 202 had lead variants which showed convergent effects (i.e., same direction of effect) on Scz, CanUD, and Smk. Genetic variants convergent across all three phenotypes showed strong genetic correlations with risk-taking, executive function, and several mental health conditions. Our results suggest that both horizontal pleiotropy and causal mechanisms may play a role in the relationship between CanUD, Smk, and Scz, but longitudinal, prospective studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Small particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) is a recognized driver of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among non-smoking individuals. Inhaled PM2.5 recruits pro-inflammatory macrophages to the air-lung interface, which promotes malignant lung epithelial cell growth and progression to overt cancer. We sought to determine whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common age-related condition characterized by hyperinflammatory macrophages, exacerbates PM2.5-associated NSCLC in non-smokers using genetic, environmental, and phenotypic data from 413,901 individuals in the UK Biobank. Among non-smokers, PM2.5 is not associated with NSCLC and not associated with prevalence of CHIP, but CHIP is associated with a doubling of NSCLC risk (hazard ratio (HR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34-3.00). Moreover, CHIP-associated NSCLC risk is exacerbated in the setting of above-median PM2.5 levels (HR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.60-4.55). PM2.5 x CHIP is also associated with significantly greater markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}) than expected. Altogether, these results suggest CHIP and PM2.5 form a novel gene x environment interaction promoting NSCLC tumorigenesis in non-smokers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Before implantation subsequent to in vitro fertilization (IVF), the current options for Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) are PGT for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) and, if clinically indicated, PGT for monogenic conditions (PGT-M). A more comprehensive approach involves PGT whole genome sequencing (PGT-WGS). PGT-WGS incorporates PGT-A, screens for hundreds of monogenic conditions, and can evaluate polygenic risk. Here we compare PGT-WGS results against the genome of the subsequently born child. We demonstrated high levels of concordance (both in sensitivity and precision) in exome variant calls between amplified embryonic DNA and sequenced fetal cord blood. This concordance was higher when filtering against 1300 targeted monogenic conditions implicated in birth defects, neurodevelopmental disorders, and hereditary cancer. To evaluate PGT-WGSs ability to identify de novo variants we compared the childs genome to parental genomes and demonstrated that PGT-WGS successfully identified 5/5 confirmed de-novo variants. We further demonstrated concordance in polygenic risk scores calculated for both the embryo and the subsequently born child. This agreement extended to both traditional polygenic scores and oligogenic scores (Type 1 diabetes, Celiac disease, and Alzheimers Disease), which heavily rely on accurate genotyping of HLA and APOE sites. To our knowledge, this is the first direct concordance study between a whole-genome sequencing of a trophectoderm biopsy and the DNA of the subsequently born child. By demonstrating a high degree of whole-exome concordance and adept detection of de novo variants, this approach showcases PGT-WGSs capability to identify genetic variants not explicitly targeted for monogenic screening.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early detection of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) informs clinical decision-making, potentially averting deadly outcomes. Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN). Fragmentomics also adjudicated AN cases suspicious for MPNST, correctly diagnosing samples noninvasively, which could have informed clinical management. Overall, this study pioneers the early detection of malignant and premalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1 patients using plasma cfDNA fragmentomics. In addition to screening applications, this novel approach distinguishes atypical neurofibromas from benign plexiform neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, enabling more precise clinical diagnosis and management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant public health concern, particularly in Africa, where there is a substantial. HBV is an enveloped virus, with isolates being classified into ten phylogenetically distinct genotypes (A - J) determined based on full-genome sequence data or reverse hybridization-based diagnostic tests. In practice, limitations are noted in that diagnostic sequencing, generally using Sanger sequencing, tends to focus only on the S-gene, yielding little or no information on intra-patient HBV genetic diversity with very low-frequency variants and reverse hybridization detects only known genotype-specific mutations. To resolve these limitations, we developed an Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)-based HBV genotyping protocol suitable for clinical virology, yielding complete HBV genome sequences and extensive data on intra-patient HBV diversity. Specifically, the protocol involves tiling-based PCR amplification of HBV sequences, library preparation using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit, ONT GridION sequencing, genotyping using Genome Detective software, recombination analysis using jpHMM and RDP5 software, and drug resistance profiling using Geno2pheno software. We prove the utility of our protocol by efficiently generating and characterizing high-quality near full-length HBV genomes from 148 left-over diagnostic Hepatitis B patient samples obtained in the Western Cape province of South Africa, providing valuable insights into the genetic diversity and epidemiology of HBV in this region of the world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Telomeres represent repeated DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, which shorten with each cell division. Factors modulating telomere attrition and the health consequences thereof are not fully understood. To address this, we leveraged data from 326,363 unrelated UK Biobank participants of European ancestry and used linear regression and bidirectional univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR and MVMR) to elucidate the relationships between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and 141 complex traits, including diseases, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. We confirm that telomeres shorten with age and show a stronger decline in males than in females, which cannot be explained by hormonal or lifestyle differences. MR revealed 23 traits modulating LTL; e.g., smoking cessation and high educational attainment associated with longer LTL, while weekly alcohol intake, body mass index, urate levels, and female reproductive events, such as childbirth, associated with shorter LTL. We also identified 26 traits affected by LTL, with risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and some autoimmune diseases being increased by short LTL, while longer LTL increased risk for other autoimmune conditions and cancers. Through MVMR, we show that LTL partially mediates the impact of educational attainment, body mass index, and female age at childbirth on lifespan. These results provide new insights into the biology of telomere regulation by shedding light on the modulators, consequences, and the mediatory role of telomere shortening, portraying an intricate relationship between LTL, diseases, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PWAS (Proteome-Wide Association Study) is an innovative genetic association approach that complements widely-used methods like GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). The PWAS platform involves consecutive phases. Initially, machine learning modeling and probabilistic considerations quantified the impact of genetic variants on protein-coding genes&#39; biochemical functions. Secondly, aggregating the variants per gene for each individual determines a gene-damaging score. Finally, standard statistical tests are activated in the case-control setting to yield statistically significant genes per phenotype. The PWAS Hub offers a user-friendly interface for an in-depth exploration of gene-disease associations from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results from PWAS cover 99 common diseases and conditions, each with over 10,000 diagnosed individuals per phenotype. Users can explore genes associated with these diseases, with separate analyses conducted for males and females. The PWAS Hub lists statistically significant genes associated with common diseases. It also indicates whether the analyzed damaged gene is associated with an increased or decreased risk. For each phenotype, the analyses account for sex-based genetic effects, inheritance modes (dominant and recessive), and the pleiotropic nature of associated genes. The PWAS Hub showcases its usefulness by navigating through such proteomic-genetic application for asthma. Graphical tools facilitate comparing genetic effects between the results of PWAS and coding GWAS, aiding in understanding the sex-specific genetic impact on common diseases. This adaptable platform is attractive for clinicians, researchers, and individuals interested in delving into gene-disease associations and sex-specific genetic effects. The PWAS Hub is accessible at http://pwas.huji.ac.il.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWe previously described the KINSSHIP syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID), mesomelic dysplasia and horseshoe kidney,caused by de novo variants in the degron of AFF3. Mouse knock-ins and overexpression in zebrafish provided evidence for a dominant-negative (DN) mode-of-action, wherein an increased level of AFF3 resulted in pathological effects.

MethodsEvolutionary constraints suggest that other mode-of-inheritance could be at play. We challenged this hypothesis by screening ID cohorts for individuals with predicted-to-be deleterious variants in AFF3. We used both animal and cellular models to assess the deleteriousness of the identified variants.

ResultsWe identified an individual with a KINSSHIP-like phenotype carrying a de novo partial duplication of AFF3 further strengthening the hypothesis that an increased level of AFF3 is pathological. We also detected seventeen individuals displaying a milder syndrome with either heterozygous LoF or biallelic missense variants in AFF3. Consistent with semi-dominance, we discovered three patients with homozygous LoF and one compound heterozygote for a LoF and a missense variant, who presented more severe phenotypes than their heterozygous parents. Matching zebrafish knockdowns exhibit neurological defects that could be rescued by expressing human AFF3 mRNA, confirming their association with the ablation of aff3. Conversely, some of the human AFF3 mRNAs carrying missense variants identified in affected individuals did not complement. Overexpression of mutated AFF3 mRNAs in zebrafish embryos produced a significant increase of abnormal larvae compared to wild-type overexpression further demonstrating deleteriousness. To further assess the effect of AFF3 variation, we profiled the transcriptome of fibroblasts from affected individuals and engineered isogenic cells harboring &#43;/&#43;, DN/DN, LoF/&#43;, LoF/LoF or DN/LoF AFF3 genotypes. The expression of more than a third of the AFF3 bound loci is modified in either the DN/DN or the LoF/LoF lines. While the same pathways are affected, only about one-third of the differentially expressed genes are common to these homozygote datasets, indicating that AFF3 LoF and DN variants largely modulate transcriptomes differently, e.g. the DNA repair pathway displayed opposite modulation.

ConclusionsOur results and the high pleiotropy shown by variation at this locus suggest that minute changes in AFF3 function are deleterious.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genes influencing opioid use disorder (OUD) biology have been identified via genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene expression, and network analyses. These discoveries provide opportunities to identifying existing compounds targeting these genes for drug repurposing studies. However, systematically integrating discovery results and identifying relevant available pharmacotherapies for OUD repurposing studies is challenging. To address this, weve constructed a framework that leverages existing results and drug databases to identify candidate pharmacotherapies.

For this study, two independent OUD related meta-analyses were used including a GWAS and a differential gene expression (DGE) study of post-mortem human brain. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) sub-networks enriched for GWAS risk loci were identified via network analyses. Drug databases Pharos, Open Targets, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and DrugBank were queried for clinical status and target selectivity. Cross-omic and drug query results were then integrated to identify candidate compounds.

GWAS and DGE analyses revealed 3 and 335 target genes (FDR q&lt;0.05), respectively, while network analysis detected 70 genes in 22 enriched PPI networks. Four selection strategies were implemented, which yielded between 72 and 676 genes with statistically significant support and 110 to 683 drugs targeting these genes, respectively. After filtering out less specific compounds or those targeting well-established psychiatric-related receptors (OPRM1 and DRD2), between 2 and 329 approved drugs remained across the four strategies.

By leveraging multiple lines of biological evidence and resources, we identified many FDA approved drugs that target genes associated with OUD. This approach a) allows high-throughput querying of OUD-related genes, b) detects OUD-related genes and compounds not identified using a single domain or resource, and c) produces a succinct summary of FDA approved compounds eligible for efficient expert review. Identifying larger pools of candidate pharmacotherapies and summarizing the supporting evidence bridges the gap between discovery and drug repurposing studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dysregulation of the epigenetic machinery is associated with neurodevelopmental defects in humans. Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by heterozygous alterations in the gene EHMT1 that cause loss-of-function. EHTM1 and EHMT2 are highly similar histone methyltransferases that play relevant roles in development. Despite their similarity, individuals with alterations in EHMT2 have never been described. Here, we describe a pediatric patient with a KS-overlapping phenotype and a single base de novo substitution in EHMT2 that causes the amino acid change p.Ala1077Ser in the catalytic SET domain. This change causes a reduction in the affinity of the catalytic domain for the H3 tail and in the activity of the enzyme by three- to five-fold. DNA methylation, histone methylation and gene expression profiles suggest a significant overlap between the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant and KS. Based on this evidence we suggest that EHMT2 haploinsufficiency causes a Kleefstra-like syndrome. Although we cannot rule out dominant negative effects caused by the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant, our data and previously published data suggest that loss of EHMT2 function is probably more detrimental to cells than loss of EHMT1, explaining why individuals with alterations in EHMT2 are very rare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individuals with schizophrenia frequently experience co-occurring substance use, including tobacco smoking and heavy cannabis use, and substance use disorders. There is interest in understanding the extent to which these relationships are causal, and to what extent shared genetic factors play a role. We explored the relationships between schizophrenia (Scz), cannabis use disorder (CanUD), and ever-regular tobacco smoking (Smk) using the largest available genome-wide studies of these phenotypes in individuals of African and European ancestries. All three phenotypes were positively genetically correlated (rgs = 0.17 - 0.62).Causal inference analyses suggested the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, but evidence for bidirectional causal relationships was also found between all three phenotypes even after correcting for horizontal pleiotropy. We identified 439 pleiotropic loci in the European ancestry data, 150 of which were novel (i.e., not genome-wide significant in the original studies). Of these pleiotropic loci, 202 had lead variants which showed convergent effects (i.e., same direction of effect) on Scz, CanUD, and Smk. Genetic variants convergent across all three phenotypes showed strong genetic correlations with risk-taking, executive function, and several mental health conditions. Our results suggest that both horizontal pleiotropy and causal mechanisms may play a role in the relationship between CanUD, Smk, and Scz, but longitudinal, prospective studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship.</p>
