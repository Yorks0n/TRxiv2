We created a curated, publicly available, multi-ancestry SV imputation panel by long-read sequencing 888 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. This high-quality panel was used to impute SVs in approximately 500,000 UK Biobank participants. We demonstrated the feasibility of conducting genome-wide SV association studies at biobank scale using 32 disease-relevant phenotypes related to respiratory, cardiometabolic and liver diseases, in addition to 1,463 protein levels. This analysis identified thousands of genome-wide significant SV associations, including hundreds of conditionally independent signals, thereby enabling novel biological insights. Focusing on genetic association studies of lung function as an example, we demonstrate the added value of SVs for prioritising causal genes at gene-rich loci compared to traditional GWAS using only short variants. We envision that future post-GWAS gene-prioritisation workflows will incorporate SV analyses using this SV imputation panel and framework.\nIdentification of Clonal Hematopoiesis Driver Mutations through In Silico Saturation Mutagenesis\nAuthors: Demajo, S.; Ramis-Zaldivar, J. E.; Muinos, F.; Grau, M. L.; Andrianova, M.; Lopez-Bigas, N.; Gonzalez-Perez, A.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299893\nClonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a phenomenon of clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells driven by somatic mutations affecting certain genes. Recently, CH has been linked to the development of a number of hematologic malignancies, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions. Although the most frequently mutated CH driver genes have been identified, a systematic landscape of the mutations capable of initiating this phenomenon is still lacking. Here, we train high-quality machine-learning models for 12 of the most recurrent CH driver genes to identify their driver mutations. These models outperform an experimental base-editing approach and expert-curated rules based on prior knowledge of the function of these genes. Moreover, their application to identify CH driver mutations across almost half a million donors of the UK Biobank reproduces known associations between CH driver mutations and age, and the prevalence of several diseases and conditions. We thus propose that these models support the accurate identification of CH across healthy individuals SignificanceWe developed and validated 12 gene-specific machine learning models to identify CH driver mutations, showing their advantage with respect to expert-curated rules. These models can support the identification and clinical interpretation of CH mutations in newly sequenced individuals.\nA maternal germline mutator phenotype in a family affected by heritable colorectal cancer\nAuthors: Young, C. L.; Beichman, A. C.; Mas Ponte, D.; Hemker, S. L.; Zhu, L.; Kitzman, J.; Shirts, B. H.; Harris, K.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.23299304\nVariation in DNA repair genes can increase cancer risk by elevating the rate of oncogenic mutation. Defects in one such gene, MUTYH, are known to elevate the incidence of colorectal cancer in a recessive Mendelian manner, and some evidence has also linked MUTYH to elevated incidence of other cancers as well as elevated mutation rates in normal somatic and germline cells. Here, we use whole genome sequencing to measure germline de novo mutation rates in a large extended family affected by pathogenic MUTYH variation and a history of colorectal cancer. Although this familys genotype, p.Y179C/V234M (c.536A\u003eG/700G\u003eA on transcript NM_001128425), contains a variant with conflicting functional interpretations, we use an in vitro cell line assay to determine that it partially attenuates MUTYHs function. In the children of mothers affected by the Y179C/V234M genotype, we identify an elevation of the C\u003eA mutation rate that is weaker than mutator effects previously reported to be caused by other pathogenic MUTYH genotypes, suggesting that mutation rates in normal tissues may be useful for classifying cancer-associated variation along a continuum of severity. Surprisingly, we detect no significant elevation of the C\u003eA mutation rate in children born to a father with the same biallelic MUTYH genotype, despite calculating that we should have adequate power to detect such a mutator effect. This suggests that the oxidative stress repaired by MUTYH may contribute more to female reproductive aging than male reproductive aging in the general population.\nA national pilot study: Clinical long-read sequencing of chromosomal rearrangements\nAuthors: Eisfeldt, J.; Ameur, A.; Lenner, F.; ten Berk de Boer, E.; Ek, M.; Wincent, J.; Vaz, R.; Ottosson, J.; Jonsson, T.; Ivarsson, S. E.; Thunstrom, S.; Topa, A.; Stenberg, S.; Rohlin, A.; Burstedt, M.; Nordin, F.; Sobol, M.; Baliakas, P.; Bondeson, M.-L.; Hojer, I.; Bilgrav Saether, K.; Lovmar, L.; Ehrencrona, H.; Melin, M.; Feuk, L.; Lindstrand, A.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23299892\nBackgroundClinical genetic laboratories often require comprehensive analysis of chromosomal rearrangements/structural variants (SVs) which can range from gross chromosomal events, such as translocations and inversions, to supernumerary ring/marker chromosomes, and small deletions or duplications. To fully understand the complexity of a specific event and its associated clinical consequences, it is imperative to locate the breakpoint junctions (BPJs) and to resolve the derivative chromosome structure. This task, however, often surpasses the capabilities of conventional short-read sequencing technologies. In contrast, emerging long-read sequencing techniques present a compelling alternative for clinical diagnostics. MethodsHere, the Genomic Medicine Sweden Rare Diseases (GMS-RD) consortium validated HiFi Revio long-read whole genome sequencing (lrGS) for clinical digital karyotyping of SVs nationwide. The first 13 samples included in this study were collected from five of the seven Swedish regions with university hospitals. We established a national pipeline and a shared variant database for variant calling and filtering. The included validation samples cover a spectrum of simple and complex SVs including inversions, translocations and copy number variants. ResultsThe results from the lrGS analysis match the reported karyotype for 11/13 individuals and known SVs were mapped at nucleotide resolution. A complex rearrangement on chromosome 15 was identified only through read depth analysis and a mosaic ring chromosome 21 remained undetected. Depending on input DNA quality, the average read length ranged from 8.3-17.6 kb and the coverage was \u003e20x for all samples. De novo assembly resulted in a limited number of contigs per individual (N50 range 6-73 Mb) clearly separating the two alleles in most cases, enabling direct characterization of the chromosomal rearrangements. ConclusionsWe have within a national pilot study successfully demonstrated the utility of HiFi Revio lrGS as a clinical analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.\nEmpowering GWAS Discovery through Enhanced Genotype Imputation\nAuthors: De Marino, A.; Mahmoud, A.

G.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300143\nGenotype imputation, crucial in genomics research, often faces accuracy limitations, notably for rarer variants. Leveraging data from the 1000 Genomes Project, TOPMed and UK Biobank, we demonstrate that Selphi, our novel imputation method, significantly outperforms Beagle5.4, Minimac4 and IMPUTE5 across various metrics (12.5%-26.5% as measured by error count) and allele frequencies (13.0%-27.1% for low-frequency variants).This improvement in accuracy boosts variant discovery in GWAS and improves polygenic risk scores.\nA rare non-coding enhancer variant in SCN5A contributes to the high prevalence of Brugada syndrome in Thailand\nAuthors: Walsh, R.; Mauleekoonphairoj, J.; Mengarelli, I.; Verkerk, A.

Rare genetic variants in the SCN5A gene, encoding the Nav1.5 sodium channel, and common non-coding variants at this locus, are robustly associated with the condition. BrS is particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia but the underlying ancestry-specific factors remain largely unknown. Here, we performed genome sequencing of BrS probands from Thailand and population-matched controls and identified a rare non-coding variant in an SCN5A intronic enhancer that is highly enriched in BrS cases (3.9% in cases, odds ratio 20.2-45.2) and predicted to disrupt a Mef2 transcription factor binding site. Heterozygous introduction of the enhancer variant in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) caused significantly reduced SCN5A expression from the variant-containing allele and a 30% reduction in Nav1.5-mediated sodium-current density compared to isogenic controls. This is the first example of a validated rare non-coding variant at the SCN5A locus and partly explains the increased prevalence of BrS in this geographic region.\nMulti-site validation of a functional assay to adjudicate SCN5A Brugada Syndrome-associated variants\nAuthors: Ma, J. G.; O'Neill, M. J.; Richardson, E.; Thomson, K.; Ingles, J.; Muhammad, A.; Solus, J. F.; Davogustto, G. E.; Anderson, K. C.; Shoemaker, M. B.; Stergachis, A. B.; Floyd, B. J.; Dunn, K.; Parikh, V. N.; Chubb, H.; Perrin, M.; Roden, D. M.; Vandenberg, J. I.; Ng, C. A.; Glazer, A. M.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23299592\nBrugada Syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable arrhythmia condition that is associated with rare, loss-of-function variants in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A. Interpreting the pathogenicity of SCN5A missense variants is challenging and [~]79% of SCN5A missense variants in ClinVar are currently classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). An in vitro SCN5A-BrS automated patch clamp assay was generated for high-throughput functional studies of NaV1.5. The assay was independently studied at two separate research sites - Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute - revealing strong correlations, including peak INa density (R2=0.86). The assay was calibrated according to ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation recommendations using high-confidence variant controls (n=49). Normal and abnormal ranges of function were established based on the distribution of benign variant assay results. The assay accurately distinguished benign controls (24/25) from pathogenic controls (23/24). Odds of Pathogenicity values derived from the experimental results yielded 0.042 for normal function (BS3 criterion) and 24.0 for abnormal function (PS3 criterion), resulting in up to strong evidence for both ACMG criteria. The calibrated assay was then used to study SCN5A VUS observed in four families with BrS and other arrhythmia phenotypes associated with SCN5A loss-of-function. The assay revealed loss-of-function for three of four variants, enabling reclassification to likely pathogenic. This validated APC assay provides clinical-grade functional evidence for the reclassification of current VUS and will aid future SCN5A-BrS variant classification.\nEvaluating the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score-stratified screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm\nAuthors: Kelemen, M.; Roychowdhury, T.; Danesh, J.; Di Angelantonio, E.; Inouye, M.; O'Sullivan, J. W.; Pennells, L.; Wood, A.; Sweeting, M.; Harrison, S.; Kim, L.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297906\nAs the heritability of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is high and AAA partially shares genetic architecture with other cardiovascular diseases, there is interest in whether genetic information could inform AAA screening strategies. Exploiting pleiotropy and meta-analysing summary data from large AAA studies, we constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for AAA. Compared with the low PRS tertile, the intermediate and high PRS tertiles had hazard ratios for AAA of 2.13 (95%CI 1.61, 2.82) and 3.70 (95%CI 2.86, 4.80) respectively, after adjusting for known clinical risk factors. Using simulation modelling, we compared PRS- and smoking-stratified screening with inviting men at age 65 and not inviting women (current UK strategy). In a futuristic scenario where genomic information is available on the population, our modelling suggests inviting male current smokers with high PRS earlier than 65 and targeting screening in female smokers with high/intermediate PRS at 65 and 70 respectively, may improve cost-effectiveness.\nLimitations in next-generation sequencing-based genotyping of breast cancer polygenic risk score loci\nAuthors: Baumann, A.; Ruckert, C.; Meier, C.; Hutschenreiter, T.; Remy, R.; Schnur, B.; Döbel, M.; Nkouamedjo Fankep, R.

F.; Honisch, E.; Hackmann, K.; Bioinformatics Working Group of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast \u0026 Ovarian Cancer, ; Schmidt, G.; Sturm, M.; Ernst, C.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23298835\nConsidering polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in individual risk prediction is increasingly becoming the standard in genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer (BC). To calculate individual BC risks, the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) with inclusion of the BCAC 313 or the BRIDGES 306 BC PRS is commonly used. Meaningful incorporation of PRSs relies on reproducing the allele frequencies (AFs), and hence, the distribution of PRS values, expected by the algorithm. Here, the 324 loci of the BCAC 313 and the BRIDGES 306 BC PRS were examined in population-specific database gnomAD and in real-world data sets of five centers of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC), to determine whether these expected AFs are achieved with next-generation sequencing-based genotyping. Four PRS loci were non-existent in gnomAD v3.1.2 non-Finnish Europeans, further 24 loci showed noticeably deviating AFs. In real-world data, between 16 and up to 22 loci were reported with noticeably deviating AFs, and were shown to have effects on final risk prediction. Deviations depended on sequencing approach, variant caller and calling mode (forced versus unforced) employed. Therefore, this study demonstrates the necessity to apply quality assurance not only in terms of sequencing coverage but also observed AFs in a sufficiently large sample, when implementing PRSs in a routine diagnostic setting. Furthermore, future PRS design should be guided by reproducibility of expected AFs in addition to the observed effect sizes.\nRare disease gene association discovery from burden analysis of the 100,000 Genomes Project data\nAuthors: Cipriani, V.; Vestito, L.; Magavern, E.

T.; Rahman, S.; Ra\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300294\nTo discover rare disease-gene associations, we developed a gene burden analytical framework and applied it to rare, protein-coding variants from whole genome sequencing of 35,008 cases with rare diseases and their family members recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP). Following in silico triaging of the results, 88 novel associations were identified including 38 with existing experimental evidence. We have published the confirmation of one of these associations, hereditary ataxia with UCHL1, and independent confirmatory evidence has recently been published for four more. We highlight a further seven compelling associations: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with DYSF and SLC4A3 where both genes show high/specific heart expression and existing associations to skeletal dystrophies or short QT syndrome respectively; monogenic diabetes with UNC13A with a known role in the regulation of {beta} cells and a mouse model with impaired glucose tolerance; epilepsy with KCNQ1 where a mouse model shows seizures and the existing long QT syndrome association may be linked; early onset Parkinson's disease with RYR1 with existing links to tremor pathophysiology and a mouse model with neurological phenotypes; anterior segment ocular abnormalities associated with POMK showing expression in corneal cells and with a zebrafish model with developmental ocular abnormalities; and cystic kidney disease with COL4A3 showing high renal expression and prior evidence for a digenic or modifying role in renal disease. Confirmation of all 88 associations would lead to potential diagnoses in 456 molecularly undiagnosed cases within the 100KGP, as well as other rare disease patients worldwide, highlighting the clinical impact of a large-scale statistical approach to rare disease gene discovery.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Advancements in long-read sequencing technology have accelerated the study of large structural variants (SVs). We created a curated, publicly available, multi-ancestry SV imputation panel by long-read sequencing 888 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. This high-quality panel was used to impute SVs in approximately 500,000 UK Biobank participants. We demonstrated the feasibility of conducting genome-wide SV association studies at biobank scale using 32 disease-relevant phenotypes related to respiratory, cardiometabolic and liver diseases, in addition to 1,463 protein levels. This analysis identified thousands of genome-wide significant SV associations, including hundreds of conditionally independent signals, thereby enabling novel biological insights. Focusing on genetic association studies of lung function as an example, we demonstrate the added value of SVs for prioritising causal genes at gene-rich loci compared to traditional GWAS using only short variants. We envision that future post-GWAS gene-prioritisation workflows will incorporate SV analyses using this SV imputation panel and framework.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a phenomenon of clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells driven by somatic mutations affecting certain genes. Recently, CH has been linked to the development of a number of hematologic malignancies, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions. Although the most frequently mutated CH driver genes have been identified, a systematic landscape of the mutations capable of initiating this phenomenon is still lacking. Here, we train high-quality machine-learning models for 12 of the most recurrent CH driver genes to identify their driver mutations. These models outperform an experimental base-editing approach and expert-curated rules based on prior knowledge of the function of these genes. Moreover, their application to identify CH driver mutations across almost half a million donors of the UK Biobank reproduces known associations between CH driver mutations and age, and the prevalence of several diseases and conditions. We thus propose that these models support the accurate identification of CH across healthy individuals

SignificanceWe developed and validated 12 gene-specific machine learning models to identify CH driver mutations, showing their advantage with respect to expert-curated rules. These models can support the identification and clinical interpretation of CH mutations in newly sequenced individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Variation in DNA repair genes can increase cancer risk by elevating the rate of oncogenic mutation. Defects in one such gene, MUTYH, are known to elevate the incidence of colorectal cancer in a recessive Mendelian manner, and some evidence has also linked MUTYH to elevated incidence of other cancers as well as elevated mutation rates in normal somatic and germline cells. Here, we use whole genome sequencing to measure germline de novo mutation rates in a large extended family affected by pathogenic MUTYH variation and a history of colorectal cancer. Although this familys genotype, p.Y179C/V234M (c.536A&gt;G/700G&gt;A on transcript NM_001128425), contains a variant with conflicting functional interpretations, we use an in vitro cell line assay to determine that it partially attenuates MUTYHs function. In the children of mothers affected by the Y179C/V234M genotype, we identify an elevation of the C&gt;A mutation rate that is weaker than mutator effects previously reported to be caused by other pathogenic MUTYH genotypes, suggesting that mutation rates in normal tissues may be useful for classifying cancer-associated variation along a continuum of severity. Surprisingly, we detect no significant elevation of the C&gt;A mutation rate in children born to a father with the same biallelic MUTYH genotype, despite calculating that we should have adequate power to detect such a mutator effect. This suggests that the oxidative stress repaired by MUTYH may contribute more to female reproductive aging than male reproductive aging in the general population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundClinical genetic laboratories often require comprehensive analysis of chromosomal rearrangements/structural variants (SVs) which can range from gross chromosomal events, such as translocations and inversions, to supernumerary ring/marker chromosomes, and small deletions or duplications. To fully understand the complexity of a specific event and its associated clinical consequences, it is imperative to locate the breakpoint junctions (BPJs) and to resolve the derivative chromosome structure. This task, however, often surpasses the capabilities of conventional short-read sequencing technologies. In contrast, emerging long-read sequencing techniques present a compelling alternative for clinical diagnostics.

MethodsHere, the Genomic Medicine Sweden Rare Diseases (GMS-RD) consortium validated HiFi Revio long-read whole genome sequencing (lrGS) for clinical digital karyotyping of SVs nationwide. The first 13 samples included in this study were collected from five of the seven Swedish regions with university hospitals. We established a national pipeline and a shared variant database for variant calling and filtering. The included validation samples cover a spectrum of simple and complex SVs including inversions, translocations and copy number variants.

ResultsThe results from the lrGS analysis match the reported karyotype for 11/13 individuals and known SVs were mapped at nucleotide resolution. A complex rearrangement on chromosome 15 was identified only through read depth analysis and a mosaic ring chromosome 21 remained undetected. Depending on input DNA quality, the average read length ranged from 8.3-17.6 kb and the coverage was &gt;20x for all samples. De novo assembly resulted in a limited number of contigs per individual (N50 range 6-73 Mb) clearly separating the two alleles in most cases, enabling direct characterization of the chromosomal rearrangements.

ConclusionsWe have within a national pilot study successfully demonstrated the utility of HiFi Revio lrGS as a clinical analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genotype imputation, crucial in genomics research, often faces accuracy limitations, notably for rarer variants. Leveraging data from the 1000 Genomes Project, TOPMed and UK Biobank, we demonstrate that Selphi, our novel imputation method, significantly outperforms Beagle5.4, Minimac4 and IMPUTE5 across various metrics (12.5%-26.5% as measured by error count) and allele frequencies (13.0%-27.1% for low-frequency variants).This improvement in accuracy boosts variant discovery in GWAS and improves polygenic risk scores.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac arrhythmia disorder that causes sudden death in young adults. Rare genetic variants in the SCN5A gene, encoding the Nav1.5 sodium channel, and common non-coding variants at this locus, are robustly associated with the condition. BrS is particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia but the underlying ancestry-specific factors remain largely unknown. Here, we performed genome sequencing of BrS probands from Thailand and population-matched controls and identified a rare non-coding variant in an SCN5A intronic enhancer that is highly enriched in BrS cases (3.9% in cases, odds ratio 20.2-45.2) and predicted to disrupt a Mef2 transcription factor binding site. Heterozygous introduction of the enhancer variant in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) caused significantly reduced SCN5A expression from the variant-containing allele and a 30% reduction in Nav1.5-mediated sodium-current density compared to isogenic controls. This is the first example of a validated rare non-coding variant at the SCN5A locus and partly explains the increased prevalence of BrS in this geographic region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable arrhythmia condition that is associated with rare, loss-of-function variants in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A. Interpreting the pathogenicity of SCN5A missense variants is challenging and [~]79% of SCN5A missense variants in ClinVar are currently classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). An in vitro SCN5A-BrS automated patch clamp assay was generated for high-throughput functional studies of NaV1.5. The assay was independently studied at two separate research sites - Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute - revealing strong correlations, including peak INa density (R2=0.86). The assay was calibrated according to ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation recommendations using high-confidence variant controls (n=49). Normal and abnormal ranges of function were established based on the distribution of benign variant assay results. The assay accurately distinguished benign controls (24/25) from pathogenic controls (23/24). Odds of Pathogenicity values derived from the experimental results yielded 0.042 for normal function (BS3 criterion) and 24.0 for abnormal function (PS3 criterion), resulting in up to strong evidence for both ACMG criteria. The calibrated assay was then used to study SCN5A VUS observed in four families with BrS and other arrhythmia phenotypes associated with SCN5A loss-of-function. The assay revealed loss-of-function for three of four variants, enabling reclassification to likely pathogenic. This validated APC assay provides clinical-grade functional evidence for the reclassification of current VUS and will aid future SCN5A-BrS variant classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the heritability of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is high and AAA partially shares genetic architecture with other cardiovascular diseases, there is interest in whether genetic information could inform AAA screening strategies. Exploiting pleiotropy and meta-analysing summary data from large AAA studies, we constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for AAA. Compared with the low PRS tertile, the intermediate and high PRS tertiles had hazard ratios for AAA of 2.13 (95%CI 1.61, 2.82) and 3.70 (95%CI 2.86, 4.80) respectively, after adjusting for known clinical risk factors. Using simulation modelling, we compared PRS- and smoking-stratified screening with inviting men at age 65 and not inviting women (current UK strategy). In a futuristic scenario where genomic information is available on the population, our modelling suggests inviting male current smokers with high PRS earlier than 65 and targeting screening in female smokers with high/intermediate PRS at 65 and 70 respectively, may improve cost-effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Considering polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in individual risk prediction is increasingly becoming the standard in genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer (BC). To calculate individual BC risks, the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) with inclusion of the BCAC 313 or the BRIDGES 306 BC PRS is commonly used. Meaningful incorporation of PRSs relies on reproducing the allele frequencies (AFs), and hence, the distribution of PRS values, expected by the algorithm. Here, the 324 loci of the BCAC 313 and the BRIDGES 306 BC PRS were examined in population-specific database gnomAD and in real-world data sets of five centers of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC), to determine whether these expected AFs are achieved with next-generation sequencing-based genotyping. Four PRS loci were non-existent in gnomAD v3.1.2 non-Finnish Europeans, further 24 loci showed noticeably deviating AFs. In real-world data, between 16 and up to 22 loci were reported with noticeably deviating AFs, and were shown to have effects on final risk prediction. Deviations depended on sequencing approach, variant caller and calling mode (forced versus unforced) employed. Therefore, this study demonstrates the necessity to apply quality assurance not only in terms of sequencing coverage but also observed AFs in a sufficiently large sample, when implementing PRSs in a routine diagnostic setting. Furthermore, future PRS design should be guided by reproducibility of expected AFs in addition to the observed effect sizes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To discover rare disease-gene associations, we developed a gene burden analytical framework and applied it to rare, protein-coding variants from whole genome sequencing of 35,008 cases with rare diseases and their family members recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP). Following in silico triaging of the results, 88 novel associations were identified including 38 with existing experimental evidence. We have published the confirmation of one of these associations, hereditary ataxia with UCHL1, and independent confirmatory evidence has recently been published for four more. We highlight a further seven compelling associations: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with DYSF and SLC4A3 where both genes show high/specific heart expression and existing associations to skeletal dystrophies or short QT syndrome respectively; monogenic diabetes with UNC13A with a known role in the regulation of {beta} cells and a mouse model with impaired glucose tolerance; epilepsy with KCNQ1 where a mouse model shows seizures and the existing long QT syndrome association may be linked; early onset Parkinson&#39;s disease with RYR1 with existing links to tremor pathophysiology and a mouse model with neurological phenotypes; anterior segment ocular abnormalities associated with POMK showing expression in corneal cells and with a zebrafish model with developmental ocular abnormalities; and cystic kidney disease with COL4A3 showing high renal expression and prior evidence for a digenic or modifying role in renal disease. Confirmation of all 88 associations would lead to potential diagnoses in 456 molecularly undiagnosed cases within the 100KGP, as well as other rare disease patients worldwide, highlighting the clinical impact of a large-scale statistical approach to rare disease gene discovery.</p>
