C.; Finer, S.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294497\nObjectiveCorrect classification of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is challenging due to overlapping clinical features and the increasingly early onset of T2D, particularly in South Asians. We used polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in a British Bangladeshi and Pakistani population with diabetes to estimate the proportion and misclassification rate of T1D in insulin-treated individuals with ambiguous features. Research Design and MethodsUsing linked health record from the Genes \u0026 Health cohort (n=38,344) we defined four groups: 31 T1D cases, 1,842 T2D cases, and after excluding these, 839 insulin-treated individuals with ambiguous features and 5,174 controls. Combining these with 307 confirmed T1D cases and 307 controls from India, we calculated ancestry-corrected PRSs for T1D and T2D, with which we estimated the proportion of T1D cases within the ambiguous group and evaluated misclassification. ResultsWe estimated that the prevalence of T1D was [~]6% within the ambiguous group, or [~]4.5% within the subset who had T2D codes in their health records. We saw no significant association between the T1D or T2D PRS and BMI at diagnosis, time to insulin, or the presence of T1D or T2D diagnostic codes amongst the T2D or ambiguous cases. ConclusionsWe estimate that 4.5% of British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis with diabetes who are treated with insulin and have ambiguous clinical features have been classified incorrectly in their health records, and in fact have T1D. These findings have significant implications for the delivery of optimal clinical care at population level.\nThe Iberian Roma genetic variant server; population structure, susceptibility to disease and adaptive traits.\nAuthors: Mavillard, F.; Perez-Florido, J.; Ortuno, F.; Valladares, A.; Alvarez-Villegas, M. L.; Roldan, G.; Carmona, R.; Soriano, M.; Susarte, S.; Fuentes, P.; Lopez-Lopez, D.; Nunez-Negrillo, A.

The Iberian Roma arrived in the Iberian Peninsula five centuries ago and still today, they keep a strong group identity. Demographic and cultural reasons lie behind a high rate of Mendelian disease often related to founder variants. We have analysed exome data from 119 Iberian Roma individuals collected from 2018 to 2020. A database of variant frequency has been implemented (IRPVS) and made available online. We have analysed the carrier rate of founder private alleles as well as pathogenic variants present in the general population. Significant enrichment in structural variants involving gene clusters related to keratinization and epidermal growth suggest that evolutive mechanisms have developed towards climate and environmental adaptation. IRPVS can be accessed at http://irpvs.clinbioinfosspa.es/ AUTHOR SUMMARYReference data is necessary for the correct interpretation of genetic studies. Although most genetic variants are present in all populations, ancestry has an important impact in the genetic background. For that reason databases of genetic variant in populations are developed specifically for different ethnicities, being an important tool for genetic diagnosis. The Roma are the most numerous ethnic minority in Europe. In this study we have collected samples from healthy Roma individuals from Iberian descent and implemented a database of genetic variant to facilitate genetic diagnosis in this population. Analysis of structural variants that are specific to the Iberian Roma not found in other healthy population for which genetic data are available suggest evolution towards environmental adaptation.\nDirect and INdirect effects analysis of Genetic lOci (DINGO): A software package to increase the power of locus discovery in GWAS meta-analyses of perinatal phenotypes and traits influenced by indirect genetic effects\nAuthors: Hwang, L.-D.; Cuellar-Partida, G.; Yengo, L.; Zeng, J.; Beaumont, R. N.; Freathy, R. M.; Moen, G.-H.; Warrington, N. M.; Evans, D. M.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294446\nPerinatal traits are influenced by genetic variants from both fetal and maternal genomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these phenotypes have typically involved separate fetal and maternal scans, however, this approach may be inefficient as it does not utilize the information shared across the individual GWAS. In this manuscript we investigate the performance of three strategies to detect loci in maternal and fetal GWAS of the same trait: (i) the traditional strategy of analysing maternal and fetal GWAS separately; (ii) a novel two degree of freedom test which combines information from maternal and fetal GWAS; and (iii) a novel one degree of freedom test where signals from maternal and fetal GWAS are meta-analysed together conditional on the estimated sample overlap. We demonstrate through a combination of analytical formulae and data simulation that the optimal strategy depends on the extent of sample overlap/relatedness between the maternal and fetal GWAS, the correlation between own and offspring phenotypes, whether loci jointly exhibit fetal and maternal effects, and if so, whether these effects are directionally concordant. We apply our methods to summary results statistics from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of birth weight from deCODE, the UK Biobank and the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium. Both the two degree of freedom (213 loci) and meta-analytic approach (226 loci) dramatically increase the number of robustly associated genetic loci for birth weight relative to separately analysing the scans (183 loci). Our best strategy identifies an additional 62 novel loci compared to the most recent published meta-analysis of birth weight and implicates both known and new biological pathways in the aetiology of the trait. We implement our methods in the online DINGO (Direct and INdirect effects analysis of Genetic lOci) software package, which allows users to perform one and/or two degree of freedom tests easily and computationally efficiently across the genome. We conclude that whilst the novel two degree of freedom test may be particularly useful for the analysis of certain perinatal phenotypes where many loci exhibit discordant maternal and fetal genetic effects, for most phenotypes, a simple meta-analytic strategy is likely to perform best, particularly in situations where maternal and fetal GWAS only partially overlap.\nSmoking during pregnancy and its effect on placental weight: A Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Jaitner, A.; Vaudel, M.; Tsaneva-Atanasova, K.; Njolstad, P. R.; Jacobsson, B.; Bowden, J.; Johansson, S.; Freathy, R.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294537\nBackgroundThe causal relationship between maternal smoking in pregnancy and reduced offspring birth weight is well established and is likely due to impaired placental function. However, observational studies have given conflicting results on the association between smoking and placental weight. We aimed to estimate the causal effect of newly pregnant mothers quitting smoking on their placental weight at the time of delivery. MethodsWe used one-sample Mendelian randomization, drawing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (up to N = 805) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (up to N = 4475). The analysis was performed in pre-pregnancy smokers only, due to the specific role of the genetic instrument SNP rs1051730 (CHRNA5 - CHRNA3 - CHRNB4) in affecting smoking cessation but not initiation. ResultsFixed effect meta-analysis showed a 175 g [95%CI: 16, 334] higher placental weight for pre-pregnancy smoking mothers who continued smoking at the beginning of pregnancy, compared with those who stopped smoking. Using the number of cigarettes smoked per day in the first trimester as the exposure, the causal estimate was a 12 g [95%CI: 2,22] higher placental weight per cigarette per day. Results were similar when the smoking exposures were measured at the end of pregnancy. Using the residuals of birth weight regressed on placental weight as the outcome, we showed weak evidence of lower offspring birth weight relative to the placental weight for continuing smoking. ConclusionOur results suggest that continued smoking during pregnancy causes higher placental weights. Key MessagesO_LIIt is well known that maternal smoking in pregnancy causes a lower birth weight on average, but the relationship between maternal smoking and placental weight is less clear, with observational studies showing conflicting results. C_LIO_LIOur Mendelian randomization study suggests that for pre-pregnancy smokers, continuing smoking during pregnancy causes higher placental weight at term than quitting smoking. C_LIO_LIOur study also suggests that a greater number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy causes a larger placental weight at term. C_LIO_LIA possible explanation for our findings is that the placenta grows larger in mothers who smoke during pregnancy to compensate for the lower oxygen availability, but further work is needed to confirm and further investigate this hypothesis.

Y.; Chen, J.; Yang, Y.; Stein, J. L.; Li, Y.; Liu, D.; Sun, L.; Zhu, H.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294848\nGenes on the X-chromosome are extensively expressed in the human brain, resulting in substantial influences on brain development, intellectual disability, and other brain-related disorders. To comprehensively investigate the X-chromosome's impact on the cerebral cortex, white matter tract microstructures, and intrinsic and extrinsic brain functions, we examined 2,822 complex brain imaging traits obtained from n = 34,000 subjects in the UK Biobank. We unveiled potential autosome-X-chromosome interaction, while proposing an atlas of dosage compensation (DC) for each set of traits. We observed a pronounced X-chromosome impact on the corticospinal tract and the functional amplitude and connectivity of visual networks. In association studies, we identified 50 genome-wide significant trait-locus pairs enriched in Xq28, 22 of which replicated in independent datasets (n = 4,900). Notably, 13 newly identified pairs were in the X-chromosome's non-pseudo-autosomal regions (NPR). The volume of the right ventral diencephalon shared genetic architecture with schizophrenia and educational attainment in a locus indexed by rs2361468 (located ~3kb upstream of PJA1, a conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders). No significant associations were identified in the pseudo-autosomal regions (PAR) or the Y-chromosome. Finally, we explored sex-specific associations on the X-chromosome and compared differing genetic effects between sexes. We found much more associations can be identified in males (33 versus 9) given a similar sample size. In conclusion, our research provides invaluable insights into the X-chromosome's role in the human brain, contributing to the observed sex differences in brain structure and function.\nIdentifying X-Chromosome Variants Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration\nAuthors: Grunin, M.; Igo, R. P.; Song, Y. E.; Blanton, S. H.; Pericak-Vance, M. A.; Haines, J. L.; International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium, Score: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294688\nPurpose: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), X chromosome (ChrX) variants are often not investigated. Sex-specific effects and ChrX-specific quality control (QC) are needed to examine these effects. Previous analyses identified 52 autosomal variants associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) via the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC), but did not analyze ChrX. Therefore, our goal was to investigate ChrX variants for association with AMD. Methods: We genotyped 29,629 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals (M/F:10,404/18,865; AMD:12,087/14,723) via a custom chip and imputed after ChrX-specific QC (XWAS 3.0) using the Michigan Imputation Server. Imputation generated 1,221,623 variants on ChrX. Age, informative PCs, and subphenotypes were covariates for logistic association analyses with Fishers correction. Gene/pathway analyses were performed with VEGAS, GSEASNP, ICSNPathway, DAVID, and mirPath. Results: Logistic association on NHW individuals with sex correction, identified variants in/near the genes SLITRK4, ARHGAP6, FGF13 and DMD associated with AMD (P\u003c1x10^-6,Fishers combined-corrected). Via association testing of subphenotypes of choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy (GA), variants in DMD associated with GA (P\u003c1x10^-6 ,Fishers combined-corrected). Via gene-based analysis with VEGAS, several genes were associated with AMD (P\u003c0.05, both truncated tail strength/truncated product P) including SLITRK4 and BHLHB9. Pathway analysis using GSEASNP and DAVID showed genes associated with nervous system development (FDR: P:0.02), and blood coagulation (FDR: P:0.03). Variants in the region of a microRNA (miR) were associated with AMD (P\u003c0.05, truncated tail strength/truncated product P). Via DIANA mirPath analysis, downstream targets of miRs show association with brain disorders and fatty acid elongation (P\u003c0.05). A long-non coding RNA on ChrX near the DMD locus was also associated with AMD (P=4x10^-7). Epistatic analysis (t-statistic) for a quantitative trait of AMD vs control including covariates found a suggestive association in the XG gene (P=2x10^-5). Conclusions: Analysis of ChrX variants demonstrates association with AMD and these variants may be linked to novel pathways. Further analysis is needed to confirm results and to understand their biological significance and relationship with AMD development in worldwide populations.\nSex differences in the pleiotropy of hearing difficulty with imaging-derived phenotypes: a brain-wide investigation.\nAuthors: He, J.; Cabrera Mendoza, B.; De Angelis, F.; Pathak, G.

While aging-related changes in the peripheral auditory system play an important role, genetic variation associated with brain structure and function could also be involved in HD predisposition. MethodsWe analyzed a large-scale HD genome-wide association study (GWAS; Ntotal = 501,825, 56% females) and GWAS data related to 3,935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) assessed in up to 33,224 individuals (52% females) using multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities. To investigate HD pleiotropy with brain structure and function, we conducted genetic correlation, latent causal variable (LCV), Mendelian randomization (MR), and multivariable generalized linear regression analyses. Additionally, we performed local genetic correlation and multi-trait colocalization analyses to identify genomic regions and loci implicated in the pleiotropic mechanisms shared between HD and brain IDPs. ResultsWe observed a widespread genetic correlation of HD with 120 IDPs in females, 89 IDPs in males, and 171 IDPs in the sex-combined analysis. The LCV analyses showed that some of these genetic correlations could be due to cause-effect relationships. For seven correlations, the causal effects were also confirmed by the MR approach: vessel volume[-\u0026gt;]HD in the sex-combined analysis; hippocampus volume[-\u0026gt;]HD, cerebellum grey matter volume[-\u0026gt;]HD, primary visual cortex volume[-\u0026gt;]HD, and HD[-\u0026gt;]rfMRI-ICA100 node 46 in females; global mean thickness[-\u0026gt;]HD and HD[-\u0026gt;]mean orientation dispersion index in superior corona radiata in males. The local genetic correlation analyses identified 13 pleiotropic regions between HD and these seven IDPs. We also observed a colocalization signal for the rs13026575 variant between HD, primary visual cortex volume, and SPTBN1 transcriptomic regulation in females. ConclusionBrain structure and function may have a role in the sex differences in HD predisposition via possible cause-effect relationships and shared regulatory mechanisms.\nRelationship between sex biases in gene expression and sex biases in autism and Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Fass, S. B.; Mulvey, B.; Yang, W.; Selmanovic, D.; Chaturvedi, S.; Tycksen, E.; Weiss, L.; Dougherty, J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23294773\nSex differences in the brain may play an important role in sex-differential prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions. In order to understand the transcriptional basis of sex differences, we analyzed multiple, large-scale, human postmortem brain RNA-seq datasets using both within-region and pan-regional frameworks. We find evidence of sex-biased transcription in many autosomal genes, some of which provide evidence for pathways and cell population differences between chromosomally male and female individuals. These analyses also highlight regional differences in the extent of sex-differential gene expression. We observe an increase in specific neuronal transcripts in male brains and an increase in immune and glial function-related transcripts in female brains. Integration with single-cell data suggests this corresponds to sex differences in cellular states rather than cell abundance. Integration with case-control gene expression studies suggests a female molecular predisposition towards Alzheimer's disease, a female-biased disease. Autism, a male-biased diagnosis, does not exhibit a male predisposition pattern in our analysis. Finally, we provide region specific analyses of sex differences in brain gene expression to enable additional studies at the interface of gene expression and diagnostic differences.\nUnique Capabilities of Genome Sequencing for Rare Disease Diagnosis\nAuthors: Wojcik, M.

Clinicians and researchers may then turn to genome sequencing (GS), though the added value of this technique and its optimal use remain poorly defined. We therefore investigated the advantages of GS within a phenotypically diverse cohort. MethodsGS was performed for 744 individuals with rare disease who were genetically undiagnosed. Analysis included review of single nucleotide, indel, structural, and mitochondrial variants. ResultsWe successfully solved 218/744 (29.3%) cases using GS, with most solves involving established disease genes (157/218, 72.0%). Of all solved cases, 148 (67.9%) had previously had non-diagnostic ES. We systematically evaluated the 218 causal variants for features requiring GS to identify and 61/218 (28.0%) met these criteria, representing 8.2% of the entire cohort. These included small structural variants (13), copy neutral inversions and complex rearrangements (8), tandem repeat expansions (6), deep intronic variants (15), and coding variants that may be more easily found using GS related to uniformity of coverage (19). ConclusionWe describe the diagnostic yield of GS in a large and diverse cohort, illustrating several types of pathogenic variation eluding ES or other techniques. Our results reveal a higher diagnostic yield of GS, supporting the utility of a genome-first approach, with consideration of GS as a secondary or tertiary test when higher-resolution structural variant analysis is needed or there is a strong clinical suspicion for a condition and prior targeted genetic testing has been negative.\nDetection and characterisation of copy number variants from exome sequencing in the DDD study\nAuthors: Danecek, P.; Gardner, E.

We aimed to evaluate the detection of copy number variants (CNVs) from exome sequencing (ES) in comparison to genome-wide low-resolution and exon-resolution chromosomal microarrays (CMA), and to characterise the properties of de novo CNVs in a large clinical cohort. MethodsWe performed CNV detection using ES of 13,462 parent-offspring trios in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study, and compared them to CNVs detected from exon-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in 5,197 probands from the DDD study. ResultsIntegrating calls from multiple ES-based CNV algorithms using random forest machine learning generated a higher quality dataset than using individual algorithms. Both ES- and aCGH-based approaches had the same sensitivity of 89% and detected the same number of unique pathogenic CNVs not called by the other approach. Of DDD probands pre-screened with low resolution CMA, 2.6% had a pathogenic CNV detected by higher resolution assays. De novo CNVs were strongly enriched in known DD-associated genes and exhibited no bias in parental age or sex. ConclusionES-based CNV calling has higher sensitivity than low-resolution CMAs currently in clinical use, and comparable sensitivity to exon-resolution CMA. With sufficient investment in bioinformatic analysis, exomebased CNV detection could replace low-resolution CMA for detecting pathogenic CNVs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveCorrect classification of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is challenging due to overlapping clinical features and the increasingly early onset of T2D, particularly in South Asians. We used polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in a British Bangladeshi and Pakistani population with diabetes to estimate the proportion and misclassification rate of T1D in insulin-treated individuals with ambiguous features.

Research Design and MethodsUsing linked health record from the Genes &amp; Health cohort (n=38,344) we defined four groups: 31 T1D cases, 1,842 T2D cases, and after excluding these, 839 insulin-treated individuals with ambiguous features and 5,174 controls. Combining these with 307 confirmed T1D cases and 307 controls from India, we calculated ancestry-corrected PRSs for T1D and T2D, with which we estimated the proportion of T1D cases within the ambiguous group and evaluated misclassification.

ResultsWe estimated that the prevalence of T1D was [~]6% within the ambiguous group, or [~]4.5% within the subset who had T2D codes in their health records. We saw no significant association between the T1D or T2D PRS and BMI at diagnosis, time to insulin, or the presence of T1D or T2D diagnostic codes amongst the T2D or ambiguous cases.

ConclusionsWe estimate that 4.5% of British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis with diabetes who are treated with insulin and have ambiguous clinical features have been classified incorrectly in their health records, and in fact have T1D. These findings have significant implications for the delivery of optimal clinical care at population level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Roma are the most numerous ethnic minority in Europe. The Iberian Roma arrived in the Iberian Peninsula five centuries ago and still today, they keep a strong group identity. Demographic and cultural reasons lie behind a high rate of Mendelian disease often related to founder variants. We have analysed exome data from 119 Iberian Roma individuals collected from 2018 to 2020. A database of variant frequency has been implemented (IRPVS) and made available online. We have analysed the carrier rate of founder private alleles as well as pathogenic variants present in the general population. Significant enrichment in structural variants involving gene clusters related to keratinization and epidermal growth suggest that evolutive mechanisms have developed towards climate and environmental adaptation. IRPVS can be accessed at http://irpvs.clinbioinfosspa.es/

AUTHOR SUMMARYReference data is necessary for the correct interpretation of genetic studies. Although most genetic variants are present in all populations, ancestry has an important impact in the genetic background. For that reason databases of genetic variant in populations are developed specifically for different ethnicities, being an important tool for genetic diagnosis. The Roma are the most numerous ethnic minority in Europe. In this study we have collected samples from healthy Roma individuals from Iberian descent and implemented a database of genetic variant to facilitate genetic diagnosis in this population. Analysis of structural variants that are specific to the Iberian Roma not found in other healthy population for which genetic data are available suggest evolution towards environmental adaptation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Perinatal traits are influenced by genetic variants from both fetal and maternal genomes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these phenotypes have typically involved separate fetal and maternal scans, however, this approach may be inefficient as it does not utilize the information shared across the individual GWAS. In this manuscript we investigate the performance of three strategies to detect loci in maternal and fetal GWAS of the same trait: (i) the traditional strategy of analysing maternal and fetal GWAS separately; (ii) a novel two degree of freedom test which combines information from maternal and fetal GWAS; and (iii) a novel one degree of freedom test where signals from maternal and fetal GWAS are meta-analysed together conditional on the estimated sample overlap. We demonstrate through a combination of analytical formulae and data simulation that the optimal strategy depends on the extent of sample overlap/relatedness between the maternal and fetal GWAS, the correlation between own and offspring phenotypes, whether loci jointly exhibit fetal and maternal effects, and if so, whether these effects are directionally concordant. We apply our methods to summary results statistics from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of birth weight from deCODE, the UK Biobank and the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium. Both the two degree of freedom (213 loci) and meta-analytic approach (226 loci) dramatically increase the number of robustly associated genetic loci for birth weight relative to separately analysing the scans (183 loci). Our best strategy identifies an additional 62 novel loci compared to the most recent published meta-analysis of birth weight and implicates both known and new biological pathways in the aetiology of the trait. We implement our methods in the online DINGO (Direct and INdirect effects analysis of Genetic lOci) software package, which allows users to perform one and/or two degree of freedom tests easily and computationally efficiently across the genome. We conclude that whilst the novel two degree of freedom test may be particularly useful for the analysis of certain perinatal phenotypes where many loci exhibit discordant maternal and fetal genetic effects, for most phenotypes, a simple meta-analytic strategy is likely to perform best, particularly in situations where maternal and fetal GWAS only partially overlap.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe causal relationship between maternal smoking in pregnancy and reduced offspring birth weight is well established and is likely due to impaired placental function. However, observational studies have given conflicting results on the association between smoking and placental weight. We aimed to estimate the causal effect of newly pregnant mothers quitting smoking on their placental weight at the time of delivery.

MethodsWe used one-sample Mendelian randomization, drawing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (up to N = 805) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (up to N = 4475). The analysis was performed in pre-pregnancy smokers only, due to the specific role of the genetic instrument SNP rs1051730 (CHRNA5 - CHRNA3 - CHRNB4) in affecting smoking cessation but not initiation.

ResultsFixed effect meta-analysis showed a 175 g [95%CI: 16, 334] higher placental weight for pre-pregnancy smoking mothers who continued smoking at the beginning of pregnancy, compared with those who stopped smoking. Using the number of cigarettes smoked per day in the first trimester as the exposure, the causal estimate was a 12 g [95%CI: 2,22] higher placental weight per cigarette per day. Results were similar when the smoking exposures were measured at the end of pregnancy. Using the residuals of birth weight regressed on placental weight as the outcome, we showed weak evidence of lower offspring birth weight relative to the placental weight for continuing smoking.

ConclusionOur results suggest that continued smoking during pregnancy causes higher placental weights.

Key MessagesO_LIIt is well known that maternal smoking in pregnancy causes a lower birth weight on average, but the relationship between maternal smoking and placental weight is less clear, with observational studies showing conflicting results.
C_LIO_LIOur Mendelian randomization study suggests that for pre-pregnancy smokers, continuing smoking during pregnancy causes higher placental weight at term than quitting smoking.
C_LIO_LIOur study also suggests that a greater number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy causes a larger placental weight at term.
C_LIO_LIA possible explanation for our findings is that the placenta grows larger in mothers who smoke during pregnancy to compensate for the lower oxygen availability, but further work is needed to confirm and further investigate this hypothesis.

        <p class="abstract">Genes on the X-chromosome are extensively expressed in the human brain, resulting in substantial influences on brain development, intellectual disability, and other brain-related disorders. To comprehensively investigate the X-chromosome&#39;s impact on the cerebral cortex, white matter tract microstructures, and intrinsic and extrinsic brain functions, we examined 2,822 complex brain imaging traits obtained from n = 34,000 subjects in the UK Biobank. We unveiled potential autosome-X-chromosome interaction, while proposing an atlas of dosage compensation (DC) for each set of traits. We observed a pronounced X-chromosome impact on the corticospinal tract and the functional amplitude and connectivity of visual networks. In association studies, we identified 50 genome-wide significant trait-locus pairs enriched in Xq28, 22 of which replicated in independent datasets (n = 4,900). Notably, 13 newly identified pairs were in the X-chromosome&#39;s non-pseudo-autosomal regions (NPR). The volume of the right ventral diencephalon shared genetic architecture with schizophrenia and educational attainment in a locus indexed by rs2361468 (located ~3kb upstream of PJA1, a conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders). No significant associations were identified in the pseudo-autosomal regions (PAR) or the Y-chromosome. Finally, we explored sex-specific associations on the X-chromosome and compared differing genetic effects between sexes. We found much more associations can be identified in males (33 versus 9) given a similar sample size. In conclusion, our research provides invaluable insights into the X-chromosome&#39;s role in the human brain, contributing to the observed sex differences in brain structure and function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Purpose: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), X chromosome (ChrX) variants are often not investigated. Sex-specific effects and ChrX-specific quality control (QC) are needed to examine these effects. Previous analyses identified 52 autosomal variants associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) via the International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC), but did not analyze ChrX. Therefore, our goal was to investigate ChrX variants for association with AMD. Methods: We genotyped 29,629 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals (M/F:10,404/18,865; AMD:12,087/14,723) via a custom chip and imputed after ChrX-specific QC (XWAS 3.0) using the Michigan Imputation Server. Imputation generated 1,221,623 variants on ChrX. Age, informative PCs, and subphenotypes were covariates for logistic association analyses with Fishers correction. Gene/pathway analyses were performed with VEGAS, GSEASNP, ICSNPathway, DAVID, and mirPath. Results: Logistic association on NHW individuals with sex correction, identified variants in/near the genes SLITRK4, ARHGAP6, FGF13 and DMD associated with AMD (P&lt;1x10^-6,Fishers combined-corrected). Via association testing of subphenotypes of choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy (GA), variants in DMD associated with GA (P&lt;1x10^-6 ,Fishers combined-corrected). Via gene-based analysis with VEGAS, several genes were associated with AMD (P&lt;0.05, both truncated tail strength/truncated product P) including SLITRK4 and BHLHB9. Pathway analysis using GSEASNP and DAVID showed genes associated with nervous system development (FDR: P:0.02), and blood coagulation (FDR: P:0.03). Variants in the region of a microRNA (miR) were associated with AMD (P&lt;0.05, truncated tail strength/truncated product P). Via DIANA mirPath analysis, downstream targets of miRs show association with brain disorders and fatty acid elongation (P&lt;0.05). A long-non coding RNA on ChrX near the DMD locus was also associated with AMD (P=4x10^-7). Epistatic analysis (t-statistic) for a quantitative trait of AMD vs control including covariates found a suggestive association in the XG gene (P=2x10^-5). Conclusions: Analysis of ChrX variants demonstrates association with AMD and these variants may be linked to novel pathways. Further analysis is needed to confirm results and to understand their biological significance and relationship with AMD development in worldwide populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHearing difficulty (HD) is one of the major health burdens in older adults. While aging-related changes in the peripheral auditory system play an important role, genetic variation associated with brain structure and function could also be involved in HD predisposition.

MethodsWe analyzed a large-scale HD genome-wide association study (GWAS; Ntotal = 501,825, 56% females) and GWAS data related to 3,935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) assessed in up to 33,224 individuals (52% females) using multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities. To investigate HD pleiotropy with brain structure and function, we conducted genetic correlation, latent causal variable (LCV), Mendelian randomization (MR), and multivariable generalized linear regression analyses. Additionally, we performed local genetic correlation and multi-trait colocalization analyses to identify genomic regions and loci implicated in the pleiotropic mechanisms shared between HD and brain IDPs.

ResultsWe observed a widespread genetic correlation of HD with 120 IDPs in females, 89 IDPs in males, and 171 IDPs in the sex-combined analysis. The LCV analyses showed that some of these genetic correlations could be due to cause-effect relationships. For seven correlations, the causal effects were also confirmed by the MR approach: vessel volume[-&amp;gt;]HD in the sex-combined analysis; hippocampus volume[-&amp;gt;]HD, cerebellum grey matter volume[-&amp;gt;]HD, primary visual cortex volume[-&amp;gt;]HD, and HD[-&amp;gt;]rfMRI-ICA100 node 46 in females; global mean thickness[-&amp;gt;]HD and HD[-&amp;gt;]mean orientation dispersion index in superior corona radiata in males. The local genetic correlation analyses identified 13 pleiotropic regions between HD and these seven IDPs. We also observed a colocalization signal for the rs13026575 variant between HD, primary visual cortex volume, and SPTBN1 transcriptomic regulation in females.

ConclusionBrain structure and function may have a role in the sex differences in HD predisposition via possible cause-effect relationships and shared regulatory mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex differences in the brain may play an important role in sex-differential prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions. In order to understand the transcriptional basis of sex differences, we analyzed multiple, large-scale, human postmortem brain RNA-seq datasets using both within-region and pan-regional frameworks. We find evidence of sex-biased transcription in many autosomal genes, some of which provide evidence for pathways and cell population differences between chromosomally male and female individuals. These analyses also highlight regional differences in the extent of sex-differential gene expression. We observe an increase in specific neuronal transcripts in male brains and an increase in immune and glial function-related transcripts in female brains. Integration with single-cell data suggests this corresponds to sex differences in cellular states rather than cell abundance. Integration with case-control gene expression studies suggests a female molecular predisposition towards Alzheimer&#39;s disease, a female-biased disease. Autism, a male-biased diagnosis, does not exhibit a male predisposition pattern in our analysis. Finally, we provide region specific analyses of sex differences in brain gene expression to enable additional studies at the interface of gene expression and diagnostic differences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCausal variants underlying rare disorders may remain elusive even after expansive gene panels or exome sequencing (ES). Clinicians and researchers may then turn to genome sequencing (GS), though the added value of this technique and its optimal use remain poorly defined. We therefore investigated the advantages of GS within a phenotypically diverse cohort.

MethodsGS was performed for 744 individuals with rare disease who were genetically undiagnosed. Analysis included review of single nucleotide, indel, structural, and mitochondrial variants.

ResultsWe successfully solved 218/744 (29.3%) cases using GS, with most solves involving established disease genes (157/218, 72.0%). Of all solved cases, 148 (67.9%) had previously had non-diagnostic ES. We systematically evaluated the 218 causal variants for features requiring GS to identify and 61/218 (28.0%) met these criteria, representing 8.2% of the entire cohort. These included small structural variants (13), copy neutral inversions and complex rearrangements (8), tandem repeat expansions (6), deep intronic variants (15), and coding variants that may be more easily found using GS related to uniformity of coverage (19).

ConclusionWe describe the diagnostic yield of GS in a large and diverse cohort, illustrating several types of pathogenic variation eluding ES or other techniques. Our results reveal a higher diagnostic yield of GS, supporting the utility of a genome-first approach, with consideration of GS as a secondary or tertiary test when higher-resolution structural variant analysis is needed or there is a strong clinical suspicion for a condition and prior targeted genetic testing has been negative.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeStructural variants such as multi-exon deletions and duplications are an important cause of disease, but are often overlooked in standard exome/genome sequencing analysis. We aimed to evaluate the detection of copy number variants (CNVs) from exome sequencing (ES) in comparison to genome-wide low-resolution and exon-resolution chromosomal microarrays (CMA), and to characterise the properties of de novo CNVs in a large clinical cohort.

MethodsWe performed CNV detection using ES of 13,462 parent-offspring trios in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study, and compared them to CNVs detected from exon-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in 5,197 probands from the DDD study.

ResultsIntegrating calls from multiple ES-based CNV algorithms using random forest machine learning generated a higher quality dataset than using individual algorithms. Both ES- and aCGH-based approaches had the same sensitivity of 89% and detected the same number of unique pathogenic CNVs not called by the other approach. Of DDD probands pre-screened with low resolution CMA, 2.6% had a pathogenic CNV detected by higher resolution assays. De novo CNVs were strongly enriched in known DD-associated genes and exhibited no bias in parental age or sex.

ConclusionES-based CNV calling has higher sensitivity than low-resolution CMAs currently in clinical use, and comparable sensitivity to exon-resolution CMA. With sufficient investment in bioinformatic analysis, exomebased CNV detection could replace low-resolution CMA for detecting pathogenic CNVs.</p>
