Current sequencing assays to detect CHIP are not optimized for the detection of these variants and can be cost-prohibitive when applied to large cohorts or serial sequencing. Here, we present and validate a CHIP targeted sequencing assay that is affordable ([~]$8/sample), accurate and highly scalable. To demonstrate the utility of this assay, we detected CHIP in a cohort of 456 individuals with DNA collected at multiple timepoints in the Vanderbilt BioVU biobank and quantified clonal expansion rates over time. A total of 101 individuals with CHIP were identified, and individual-level clonal expansion rate was calculated using the variant allele fraction (VAF) at both timepoints. Differences in clonal expansion rate by driver gene were observed, but there was also significant individual-level heterogeneity, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of clonal expansion. We further describe the mutation co-occurrence and clonal competition between multiple driver mutations.\nSingle locus theory of admixture is insufficient for the study of complex traits in admixed populations\nAuthors: Lee, H.; Lee, M.-H.; Hou, K.; Pasaniuc, B.; Han, B.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298201\nAdmixed populations offer valuable insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits. Investigation of such a topic demands a delicate theory that can handle the complex demographic history of admixed populations. With additional assumptions, we show that Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) can predict empirical GWAS findings. We name this the extended PSD (ePSD) model and evaluate the predictions using real data. When applied to real data of admixed genomes, the prediction of the ePSD model is very successful in explaining single-locus behaviors while falling short in predicting two-locus phenomena involving linkage disequilibrium. Our results show that a mosaic of independent single-continental segments is an insufficient approximation of contemporary admixed populations. A more advanced theory that better models linkage disequilibrium of admixed populations will be crucial to better understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.\nNetwork medicine-based epistasis detection in complex diseases: ready for quantum computing\nAuthors: Hoffmann, M.; Incudini, M.; Poschenrieder, J.

A.; Hennighausen, L.; Di Score: 5.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298205\nMost heritable diseases are polygenic. To comprehend the underlying genetic architecture, it is crucial to discover the clinically relevant epistatic interactions (EIs) between genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)1-3. Existing statistical computational methods for EI detection are mostly limited to pairs of SNPs due to the combinatorial explosion of higher-order EIs. With NeEDL (network-based epistasis detection via local search), we leverage network medicine to inform the selection of EIs that are an order of magnitude more statistically significant compared to existing tools and consist, on average, of five SNPs. We further show that this computationally demanding task can be substantially accelerated once quantum computing hardware becomes available. We apply NeEDL to eight different diseases and discover genes (affected by EIs of SNPs) that are partly known to affect the disease, additionally, these results are reproducible across independent cohorts. EIs for these eight diseases can be interactively explored in the Epistasis Disease Atlas (https://epistasis-disease-atlas.com). In summary, NeEDL is the first application that demonstrates the potential of seamlessly integrated quantum computing techniques to accelerate biomedical research. Our network medicine approach detects higher-order EIs with unprecedented statistical and biological evidence, yielding unique insights into polygenic diseases and providing a basis for the development of improved risk scores and combination therapies.\nA Massively Parallel Screen of 5'UTR Mutations Identifies Variants Impacting Translation and Protein Production in Neurodevelopmental Disorder Genes\nAuthors: Plassmeyer, S. P.; Florian, C. P.; Kasper, M. J.; Chase, R.; Mueller, S.; Liu, Y.; McFarland White, K.; Jungers, C. F.; Pavlovic Djuranovic, S.; Djuranovic, S.; Dougherty, J. D.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297961\nDe novo mutations cause a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Recent whole genome sequencing from individuals with autism has shown that many de novo mutations also occur in untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, but it is difficult to predict from sequence alone which mutations are functional, let alone causal. Therefore, we developed a high throughput assay to screen the transcriptional and translational effects of 997 variants from 5'UTR patient mutations. This assay successfully enriched for elements that alter reporter translation, identifying over 100 potentially functional mutations from probands. Studies in patient-derived cell lines further confirmed that these mutations can alter protein production in individuals with autism, and some variants fall in genes known to cause syndromic forms of autism, suggesting a diagnosis for these individual patients. Since UTR function varies by cell type, we further optimized this high throughput assay to enable assessment of mutations in neurons in vivo. First, comparing in cellulo to in vivo results, we demonstrate neurons have different principles of regulation by 5'UTRs, consistent with a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of RNA secondary structure. Finally, we discovered patient mutations specifically altering the translational activity of additional known syndromic genes LRRC4 and ZNF644 in neurons of the brain. Overall our results highlight a new approach for assessing the impact of 5'UTR mutations across cell types and suggest that some cases of neurodevelopmental disorder may be caused by such variants.\nEstimating cancer risk in carriers of Lynch syndrome variants in UK Biobank\nAuthors: Fummey, E.; Navarro, P.; Plazzer, J.-P.; Frayling, I. M.; Knott, S.; Tenesa, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298308\nBackgroundLynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by genetic variants affecting DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Cancer risk in LS is estimated from cohorts of individuals ascertained by family history of cancer, which is known to upwardly bias estimates. MethodsThe InSiGHT Database classifies MMR gene variants by pathogenicity through expert panel review of published evidence. 830 carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (path_MMR) MMR gene variants from InSiGHT were identified in 454,756 UK Biobank participants using whole exome sequence. Nelson-Aalen survival analysis was used to estimate cumulative incidence of colorectal, endometrial, and breast cancer. ResultsCumulative incidence of colorectal and endometrial cancer by age 70 was elevated in path_MMR carriers compared to non-carriers (colorectal: 11.8% (95% CI: 9.5 - 14.6) vs. 1.7% (1.6 - 1.7), endometrial: 13.4% (10.2 - 17.6) vs. 1.0% (0.9 - 1.0)), but the magnitude of this increase differed between genes. Cumulative breast cancer incidence by age 70 was not elevated in path_MMR carriers compared to non-carriers (8.9% (6.3 - 12.4) vs. 7.5% (7.4 - 7.6)). Cumulative cancer incidence estimates in UK Biobank were similar to estimates from the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database for all genes and cancers, except there was no evidence for elevated endometrial cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic PMS2 variants in UK Biobank. ConclusionThese results can be used to inform the management of incidentally identified cases of LS. For example, they support the application of existing colorectal cancer surveillance strategies for LS in incidentally identified cases.\nComparison of gene expression in living and postmortem human brain\nAuthors: Collado-Torres, L.; Klei, L.; Liu, C.; Kleinman, J. E.; Hyde, T. M.; Geschwind, D. H.; Gandal, M. J.; Devlin, B.; Weinberger, D. R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298172\nMolecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders are challenging to study in human brain. For decades, the preferred model has been to study postmortem human brain samples despite the limitations they entail. A recent study generated RNA sequencing data from biopsies of prefrontal cortex from living patients with Parkinsons Disease and compared gene expression to postmortem tissue samples, from which they found vast differences between the two. This led the authors to question the utility of postmortem human brain studies. Through re-analysis of the same data, we unexpectedly found that the living brain tissue samples were of much lower quality than the postmortem samples across multiple standard metrics. We also performed simulations that illustrate the effects of ignoring RNA degradation in differential gene expression analyses, showing the effects can be substantial and of similar magnitude to what the authors find. For these reasons, we believe the authors conclusions are unjustified. To the contrary, while opportunities to study gene expression in the living brain are welcome, evidence that this eclipses the value of postmortem analyses is not apparent.\nA Genomics England haplotype reference panel and the imputation of the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Shi, S.; Rubinacci, S.; Hu, S.; Moutsianas, L.; Stuckey, A.; Need, A. C.; The Genomics England Resarch Consortium, ; Caulfield, M.; Marchini, J.; Myers, S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298035\nThe choice of reference panels significantly impacts phasing, imputation and GWAS results. In this study, we built a haplotype reference panel using the Genomics England (GEL) high-coverage sequencing dataset, one of the largest genetic variation resources ever collected in the UK. The resulting reference panel consists of 156,390 haplotypes and 342 million autosomal variants. The GEL reference panel demonstrates reliable imputation of variants as rare as 1 in 10,000 within the White British population, with an imputation r2 value of 0.75. The resulting imputed UKB data (GEL-UKB) contains three times more variants, predominantly rare variants, compared to the UKB data previously imputed using the HRC and UK10K reference panel. The GEL-UKB presents a unique opportunity for the reliable discovery of rare associations across the whole genome, especially within the regions not covered by the exome sequencing data. Rare variant signals with high confidence are predominantly from rare coding variants, implying firstly, a probable tendency for existing rare non-coding mutations to not reach a disruptive level comparable to that of coding variants. Secondly, it raises the possibility that the current sample size of UK Biobank may be insufficient for detecting rare variants with a moderate effect size, even with the whole genome sequencing. The resulting GEL phased haplotype reference panel has been made available on the GEL platform and widely used by GEL users. Our GEL imputed UKB data has been adopted as one of the UKB official imputed data resources (Data Field 21008).\nPheNorm, a language model normalizer of physical examinations from genetics clinical notes\nAuthors: Weissenbacher, D.; Rawal, S.; Zhao, X.; Priestley, J. R. C.; Szigety, K. M.; Schmidt, S. F.; Higgins, M. J.; Magge, A.; O'Connor, K.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.; Campbell, I. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23296894\nBackgroundPhenotypes identified during dysmorphology physical examinations are critical to genetic diagnosis and nearly universally documented as free-text in the electronic health record (EHR). Variation in how phenotypes are recorded in free-text makes large-scale computational analysis extremely challenging. Existing natural language processing (NLP) approaches to address phenotype extraction are trained largely on the biomedical literature or on case vignettes rather than actual EHR data. MethodsWe implemented a tailored system at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelpia that allows clinicians to document dysmorphology physical exam findings. From the underlying data, we manually annotated a corpus of 3136 organ system observations using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We provide this corpus publicly. We trained a transformer based NLP system to identify HPO terms from exam observations. The pipeline includes an extractor, which identifies tokens in the sentence expected to contain an HPO term, and a normalizer, which uses those tokens together with the original observation to determine the specific term mentioned. FindingsWe find that our labeler and normalizer NLP pipeline, which we call PheNorm, achieves state-of-the-art performance for the dysmorphology physical exam phenotype extraction task. PheNorms performance on the test set was 0.717, compared to the nearest baseline system (PhenoTagger) performance of 0.633. An analysis of our systems normalization errors shows possible imperfections in the HPO terminology itself but also reveals a lack of semantic understanding by our transformer models. InterpretationTransformers-based NLP models are a promising approach to genetic phenotype extraction and, with recent development of larger pre-trained causal language models, may improve semantic understanding in the future. We believe our results also have direct applicability to more general extraction of medical signs and symptoms.

C.; Bose, A.; Dexter, G.; PARIDA, L.; Drineas, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298469\nLinear mixed models (LMMs) have been widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to control for population stratification and cryptic relatedness. Unfortunately, estimating LMM parameters is computationally expensive, necessitating large-scale matrix operations to build the genetic relatedness matrix (GRM). Over the past 25 years, Randomized Linear Algebra has provided alternative approaches to such matrix operations by leveraging matrix sketching, which often results in provably accurate fast and efficient approximations. We leverage matrix sketching to develop a fast and efficient LMM method called Matrix-Sketching LMM (MaSk-LMM) by sketching the genotype matrix to reduce its dimensions and speed up computations. Our framework comes with both theoretical guarantees and a strong empirical performance compared to current state-of-the-art.\nGenome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen levels in 392,522 men identifies new loci and improves cross-ancestry prediction\nAuthors: Hoffmann, T.

A.;\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297676\nWe conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in 296,754 men (211,342 European ancestry; 58,236 African ancestry; 23,546 Hispanic/Latino; 3,630 Asian ancestry; 96.5% of participants were from the Million Veteran Program). We identified 318 independent genome-wide significant (p[\u0026le;]5e-8) variants, 184 of which were novel. Most demonstrated evidence of replication in an independent cohort (n=95,768). Meta-analyzing discovery and replication (n=392,522) identified 447 variants, of which a further 111 were novel. Out-of-sample variance in PSA explained by our new polygenic risk score reached 16.9% (95% CI=16.1%-17.8%) in European ancestry, 9.5% (95% CI=7.0%-12.2%) in African ancestry, 18.6% (95% CI=15.8%-21.4%) in Hispanic/Latino, and 15.3% (95% CI=12.7%-18.1%) in Asian ancestry, and lower for higher age. Our study highlights how including proportionally more participants from underrepresented populations improves genetic prediction of PSA levels, with potential to personalize prostate cancer screening.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common age-related phenomenon that occurs when hematopoietic stem cells acquire mutations in a select set of genes commonly mutated in myeloid neoplasia which then expand clonally. Current sequencing assays to detect CHIP are not optimized for the detection of these variants and can be cost-prohibitive when applied to large cohorts or serial sequencing. Here, we present and validate a CHIP targeted sequencing assay that is affordable ([~]$8/sample), accurate and highly scalable. To demonstrate the utility of this assay, we detected CHIP in a cohort of 456 individuals with DNA collected at multiple timepoints in the Vanderbilt BioVU biobank and quantified clonal expansion rates over time. A total of 101 individuals with CHIP were identified, and individual-level clonal expansion rate was calculated using the variant allele fraction (VAF) at both timepoints. Differences in clonal expansion rate by driver gene were observed, but there was also significant individual-level heterogeneity, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of clonal expansion. We further describe the mutation co-occurrence and clonal competition between multiple driver mutations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Admixed populations offer valuable insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits. Investigation of such a topic demands a delicate theory that can handle the complex demographic history of admixed populations. With additional assumptions, we show that Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) can predict empirical GWAS findings. We name this the extended PSD (ePSD) model and evaluate the predictions using real data. When applied to real data of admixed genomes, the prediction of the ePSD model is very successful in explaining single-locus behaviors while falling short in predicting two-locus phenomena involving linkage disequilibrium. Our results show that a mosaic of independent single-continental segments is an insufficient approximation of contemporary admixed populations. A more advanced theory that better models linkage disequilibrium of admixed populations will be crucial to better understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most heritable diseases are polygenic. To comprehend the underlying genetic architecture, it is crucial to discover the clinically relevant epistatic interactions (EIs) between genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)1-3. Existing statistical computational methods for EI detection are mostly limited to pairs of SNPs due to the combinatorial explosion of higher-order EIs. With NeEDL (network-based epistasis detection via local search), we leverage network medicine to inform the selection of EIs that are an order of magnitude more statistically significant compared to existing tools and consist, on average, of five SNPs. We further show that this computationally demanding task can be substantially accelerated once quantum computing hardware becomes available. We apply NeEDL to eight different diseases and discover genes (affected by EIs of SNPs) that are partly known to affect the disease, additionally, these results are reproducible across independent cohorts. EIs for these eight diseases can be interactively explored in the Epistasis Disease Atlas (https://epistasis-disease-atlas.com). In summary, NeEDL is the first application that demonstrates the potential of seamlessly integrated quantum computing techniques to accelerate biomedical research. Our network medicine approach detects higher-order EIs with unprecedented statistical and biological evidence, yielding unique insights into polygenic diseases and providing a basis for the development of improved risk scores and combination therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">De novo mutations cause a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Recent whole genome sequencing from individuals with autism has shown that many de novo mutations also occur in untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes, but it is difficult to predict from sequence alone which mutations are functional, let alone causal. Therefore, we developed a high throughput assay to screen the transcriptional and translational effects of 997 variants from 5&#39;UTR patient mutations. This assay successfully enriched for elements that alter reporter translation, identifying over 100 potentially functional mutations from probands. Studies in patient-derived cell lines further confirmed that these mutations can alter protein production in individuals with autism, and some variants fall in genes known to cause syndromic forms of autism, suggesting a diagnosis for these individual patients. Since UTR function varies by cell type, we further optimized this high throughput assay to enable assessment of mutations in neurons in vivo. First, comparing in cellulo to in vivo results, we demonstrate neurons have different principles of regulation by 5&#39;UTRs, consistent with a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of RNA secondary structure. Finally, we discovered patient mutations specifically altering the translational activity of additional known syndromic genes LRRC4 and ZNF644 in neurons of the brain. Overall our results highlight a new approach for assessing the impact of 5&#39;UTR mutations across cell types and suggest that some cases of neurodevelopmental disorder may be caused by such variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by genetic variants affecting DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Cancer risk in LS is estimated from cohorts of individuals ascertained by family history of cancer, which is known to upwardly bias estimates.

MethodsThe InSiGHT Database classifies MMR gene variants by pathogenicity through expert panel review of published evidence. 830 carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic (path_MMR) MMR gene variants from InSiGHT were identified in 454,756 UK Biobank participants using whole exome sequence. Nelson-Aalen survival analysis was used to estimate cumulative incidence of colorectal, endometrial, and breast cancer.

ResultsCumulative incidence of colorectal and endometrial cancer by age 70 was elevated in path_MMR carriers compared to non-carriers (colorectal: 11.8% (95% CI: 9.5 - 14.6) vs. 1.7% (1.6 - 1.7), endometrial: 13.4% (10.2 - 17.6) vs. 1.0% (0.9 - 1.0)), but the magnitude of this increase differed between genes. Cumulative breast cancer incidence by age 70 was not elevated in path_MMR carriers compared to non-carriers (8.9% (6.3 - 12.4) vs. 7.5% (7.4 - 7.6)). Cumulative cancer incidence estimates in UK Biobank were similar to estimates from the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database for all genes and cancers, except there was no evidence for elevated endometrial cancer risk in carriers of pathogenic PMS2 variants in UK Biobank.

ConclusionThese results can be used to inform the management of incidentally identified cases of LS. For example, they support the application of existing colorectal cancer surveillance strategies for LS in incidentally identified cases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders are challenging to study in human brain. For decades, the preferred model has been to study postmortem human brain samples despite the limitations they entail. A recent study generated RNA sequencing data from biopsies of prefrontal cortex from living patients with Parkinsons Disease and compared gene expression to postmortem tissue samples, from which they found vast differences between the two. This led the authors to question the utility of postmortem human brain studies. Through re-analysis of the same data, we unexpectedly found that the living brain tissue samples were of much lower quality than the postmortem samples across multiple standard metrics. We also performed simulations that illustrate the effects of ignoring RNA degradation in differential gene expression analyses, showing the effects can be substantial and of similar magnitude to what the authors find. For these reasons, we believe the authors conclusions are unjustified. To the contrary, while opportunities to study gene expression in the living brain are welcome, evidence that this eclipses the value of postmortem analyses is not apparent.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The choice of reference panels significantly impacts phasing, imputation and GWAS results. In this study, we built a haplotype reference panel using the Genomics England (GEL) high-coverage sequencing dataset, one of the largest genetic variation resources ever collected in the UK. The resulting reference panel consists of 156,390 haplotypes and 342 million autosomal variants. The GEL reference panel demonstrates reliable imputation of variants as rare as 1 in 10,000 within the White British population, with an imputation r2 value of 0.75. The resulting imputed UKB data (GEL-UKB) contains three times more variants, predominantly rare variants, compared to the UKB data previously imputed using the HRC and UK10K reference panel. The GEL-UKB presents a unique opportunity for the reliable discovery of rare associations across the whole genome, especially within the regions not covered by the exome sequencing data. Rare variant signals with high confidence are predominantly from rare coding variants, implying firstly, a probable tendency for existing rare non-coding mutations to not reach a disruptive level comparable to that of coding variants. Secondly, it raises the possibility that the current sample size of UK Biobank may be insufficient for detecting rare variants with a moderate effect size, even with the whole genome sequencing. The resulting GEL phased haplotype reference panel has been made available on the GEL platform and widely used by GEL users. Our GEL imputed UKB data has been adopted as one of the UKB official imputed data resources (Data Field 21008).</p>

Existing natural language processing (NLP) approaches to address phenotype extraction are trained largely on the biomedical literature or on case vignettes rather than actual EHR data.

MethodsWe implemented a tailored system at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelpia that allows clinicians to document dysmorphology physical exam findings. From the underlying data, we manually annotated a corpus of 3136 organ system observations using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We provide this corpus publicly. We trained a transformer based NLP system to identify HPO terms from exam observations. The pipeline includes an extractor, which identifies tokens in the sentence expected to contain an HPO term, and a normalizer, which uses those tokens together with the original observation to determine the specific term mentioned.

FindingsWe find that our labeler and normalizer NLP pipeline, which we call PheNorm, achieves state-of-the-art performance for the dysmorphology physical exam phenotype extraction task. PheNorms performance on the test set was 0.717, compared to the nearest baseline system (PhenoTagger) performance of 0.633. An analysis of our systems normalization errors shows possible imperfections in the HPO terminology itself but also reveals a lack of semantic understanding by our transformer models.

InterpretationTransformers-based NLP models are a promising approach to genetic phenotype extraction and, with recent development of larger pre-trained causal language models, may improve semantic understanding in the future. We believe our results also have direct applicability to more general extraction of medical signs and symptoms.

        <p class="abstract">Linear mixed models (LMMs) have been widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to control for population stratification and cryptic relatedness. Unfortunately, estimating LMM parameters is computationally expensive, necessitating large-scale matrix operations to build the genetic relatedness matrix (GRM). Over the past 25 years, Randomized Linear Algebra has provided alternative approaches to such matrix operations by leveraging matrix sketching, which often results in provably accurate fast and efficient approximations. We leverage matrix sketching to develop a fast and efficient LMM method called Matrix-Sketching LMM (MaSk-LMM) by sketching the genotype matrix to reduce its dimensions and speed up computations. Our framework comes with both theoretical guarantees and a strong empirical performance compared to current state-of-the-art.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in 296,754 men (211,342 European ancestry; 58,236 African ancestry; 23,546 Hispanic/Latino; 3,630 Asian ancestry; 96.5% of participants were from the Million Veteran Program). We identified 318 independent genome-wide significant (p[&amp;le;]5e-8) variants, 184 of which were novel. Most demonstrated evidence of replication in an independent cohort (n=95,768). Meta-analyzing discovery and replication (n=392,522) identified 447 variants, of which a further 111 were novel. Out-of-sample variance in PSA explained by our new polygenic risk score reached 16.9% (95% CI=16.1%-17.8%) in European ancestry, 9.5% (95% CI=7.0%-12.2%) in African ancestry, 18.6% (95% CI=15.8%-21.4%) in Hispanic/Latino, and 15.3% (95% CI=12.7%-18.1%) in Asian ancestry, and lower for higher age. Our study highlights how including proportionally more participants from underrepresented populations improves genetic prediction of PSA levels, with potential to personalize prostate cancer screening.</p>
