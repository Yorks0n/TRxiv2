  "articleBody": " Unreliability in Simulations of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Based on Transmission Models\nAuthors: Kakeya, H.; Itoh, M.; Kamijima, Y.; Nitta, T.; Umeno, Y.\nScore: 401.7, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302123\nTwo papers authored by the same research group were published in academic journals in October 2023, both of which simulate counterfactual COVID-19 cases and deaths using transmission models. One paper estimates that the COVID-19 cases and deaths from Feb 17 to Nov 30, 2021 in Japan would have been as many as 63.3 million and 364 thousand respectively had the vaccination not been implemented, where the 95% confidence interval is claimed to be less than 1% of the estimated value. It also claims that the cases and deaths could have been reduced by 54% and 48% respectively had the vaccination been implemented 14 days earlier. The other paper estimates that the number of cases in early 2022, Tokyo would have been larger than the number of populations in the age group under 49 in the absence of the vaccination program. In this paper, we reexamine the results given by these papers to find that the simulation results do not explain the real-world data in Japan including prefectures with early/late vaccination schedules. The cause of discrepancy is identified as low reliability of model parameters that immensely affect the simulation results of case and death counts. Leaders of public healthcare are required to discern the reliability and credibility of simulation studies and to prepare for variety of possible scenarios when reliable predictions are not available.\nUnderestimation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater due to single or double mutations in the N1 qPCR probe binding region\nAuthors: Sun, J.; Yang, M. I.; Peng, J.; Lopez, J. J.; Khan, I.; Chan, R.; Edwards, E. A.; Peng, H.\nScore: 128.6, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.03.24302274\nWastewater surveillance using RT-qPCR has now been widely adopted to track circulating levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus in many sewer sheds. The CDC qPCR assays targeting two regions (N1 and N2) within the N gene are commonly used, but a discrepancy between the two biomarkers has been noticed by many groups using this method since late 2021. The reason is presumed to be due to mutations in regions targeted by the qPCR probe. In this study, we systematically investigated and unequivocally confirmed that the underlying reason for this discrepancy was mutations in the N1 probe target, and that a single mutation could cause a significant drop in signal. We first confirmed the proportion of related mutations in wastewater samples (Jan 2021-Dec 2022) using nested PCR and LC-MS. Based on relative proportion of N1 alleles, we separated the wastewater data into four time periods corresponding to different variant waves: Period I (Alpha and Delta waves with 0 mutation), Period II (BA.1/BA.2 wave with a single mutation found in all Omicron strains), Period III (BA. 5.2* wave with two mutations), and Period IV (BQ.1* wave with two mutations). Significantly lower N1 copies relative to N2 copies in samples from Periods II-IV compared to those from Period I was observed in wastewater. To further pinpoint the extent to which each mutation impacted N1 quantification, we compared the qPCR response among different synthetic oligomers with corresponding mutations. This study highlighted the impact of even just one or two mutations on qPCR-based wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.\nResults reporting for clinical trials led by medical universities and university hospitals in the Nordic countries was often missing or delayed\nAuthors: Nilsonne, G.; Wieschowski, S.; DeVito, N.

L.; Boesen, K.; Hemkens, L. G.; Naudet, F.; Possmark, S.; Willen, R. M.; Ioannidis, J. P.; Strech, D.; Axfors, C.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.24301363\nObjectiveTo systematically evaluate timely reporting of clinical trial results at medical universities and university hospitals in the Nordic countries. Study Design and SettingIn this cross-sectional study, we included trials (regardless of intervention) registered in the EU Clinical Trials Registry and/or ClinicalTrials.gov, completed 2016-2019, and led by a university with medical faculty or university hospital in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden. We identified summary results posted at the trial registries, and conducted systematic manual searches for results publications (e.g., journal articles, preprints). We present proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and medians with interquartile range (IQR). Protocol: https://osf.io/wua3r ResultsAmong 2,113 included clinical trials, 1,638 (77.5%, 95%CI 75.9-79.2%) reported any results during our follow-up; 1,092 (51.7%, 95%CI 49.5-53.8%) reported any results within 2 years of the global completion date; and 42 (2%, 95%CI 1.5-2.7%) posted summary results in the registry within 1 year. Median time from global completion date to results reporting was 698 days (IQR 1,123). 856/1,681 (50.9%) of ClinicalTrials.gov-registrations were prospective. Denmark contributed approximately half of all trials. Reporting performance varied widely between institutions. ConclusionMissing and delayed results reporting of academically-led clinical trials is a pervasive problem in the Nordic countries. We relied on trial registry information, which can be incomplete. Institutions, funders, and policy makers need to support trial teams, ensure regulation adherence, and secure trial reporting before results are permanently lost. What is new?- Many Nordic registered clinical trials were reported late or not at all. - Almost one in four trials remained unreported at the end of our search period. - About half of registered trials had reported results two years after completion. - Only 2% of trials posted summary results in the registry one year after completion. - Concerted action is needed to improve reporting of Nordic clinical trials.\nEstimated number of lives directly saved by COVID-19 vaccination programs in the WHO European Region, December 2020 to March 2023\nAuthors: Mesle, M. M.; Brown, J.; Mook, P.; Katz, M. A.; Hagan, J.; Pastore, R.; Nitzan, D.; Benka, B.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Bossuyt, N.; Stouten, V.; Vernemmen, C.; Constantinou, E.; Kyncl, J.; Maly, M.; Sanca, O.; Grove Krause, T.; Skafte Vestergaard, L.; Leino, T.; Poukka, E.; Gkolfinopoulou, K.; Mellou, K.; Maria Tsintziloni, M.; Molnar, Z.; Aspelund, G.; Thordardottir, M.; Domegan, L.; Kelly, E.; O'Donell, J.; Sacco, C.; Riccardo, F.; Mateo Urdiales, A.; Bumsteinas, V.; Liausediene, R.; Mossong, J.; Vergison, A.; Borg, M.-L.; Melillo, T.; Kocinski, D.; Pollozhani, E.; Meijerink, H.; Costa, D.; Pa\nScore: 763.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301206\nBackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter \"CAT\") reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023. MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths. FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [\u0026ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [\u0026ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [\u0026ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period. InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures. FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest. Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [\u0026ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [\u0026ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [\u0026ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967). Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.\nBidirectional relationship between sleep problems and long COVID: a longitudinal analysis of data from the COVIDENCE UK study\nAuthors: Vivaldi, G.; Talaei, M.; Blaikley, J.; Jackson, C.; Pfeffer, P. E.; Shaheen, S. O.; Martineau, A. R.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.24302486\nSummary Background: Studies into the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long COVID have been limited by retrospective pre-infection sleep data and infrequent post-infection follow-up. We therefore used prospectively collected monthly data to evaluate how pre-infection sleep characteristics affect risk of long COVID, and to track changes in sleep duration during the year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, population-based UK study of COVID-19 in adults. We included non-hospitalised participants with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for the association between pre-infection sleep characteristics and long COVID using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. We assessed changes in sleep duration after infection using multilevel mixed models. We defined long COVID as unresolved symptoms at least 12 weeks after infection. We defined sleep quality according to age-dependent combinations of sleep duration and efficiency. COVIDENCE UK is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04330599. Findings: We included 3994 participants in our long COVID risk analysis, of whom 327 (8.2%) reported long COVID. We found an inverse relationship between pre-infection sleep quality and risk of long COVID (medium vs good quality: OR 1.37[95% CI 1.04-1.81]; medium-low vs good: 1.55 [1.12-2.16]; low vs good: 1.94 [1.11-3.38]). Greater variability in pre-infection sleep efficiency was also associated with long COVID (OR per percentage-point increase 1.06 [1.01-1.11]). We assessed post-infection sleep duration in 6860 participants, observing a 0.11 h (95% CI 0.08-0.13) increase in the first month after infection compared with pre-infection, with larger increases for more severe infections. After 1 month, sleep duration largely returned to pre-infection levels, although fluctuations in duration lasted up to 6 months after infection among people reporting long COVID. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long COVID. While poor-quality sleep before SARS-CoV-2 infection associates with increased risk of long COVID thereafter, changes in sleep duration after infection in these non-hospitalised cases were modest and generally quick to resolve.\nA Stacking Framework for Polygenic Risk Prediction in Admixed Individuals\nAuthors: Liao, K.; Zöllner, S.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302103\n1.1Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are summaries of an individuals personalized genetic risk for a trait or disease. However, PRS often perform poorly for phenotype prediction when the ancestry of the target population does not match the population in which GWAS effect sizes were estimated. For many populations this can be addressed by performing GWAS in the target population. However, admixed individuals (whose genomes can be traced to multiple ancestral populations) lie on an ancestry continuum and are not easily represented as a discrete population. Here, we propose slaPRS (stacking local ancestry PRS), which incorporates multiple ancestry GWAS to alleviate the ancestry dependence of PRS in admixed samples. slaPRS uses ensemble learning (stacking) to combine local population specific PRS in regions across the genome. We compare slaPRS to single population PRS and a method that combines single population PRS globally. In simulations, slaPRS outperformed existing approaches and reduced the ancestry dependence of PRS in African Americans. In lipid traits from African British individuals (UK Biobank), slaPRS again improved on single population PRS while performing comparably to the globally combined PRS. slaPRS provides a data-driven and flexible framework to incorporate multiple population-specific GWAS and local ancestry in samples of admixed ancestry.\nSafety of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine batches: A nationwide cohort study\nAuthors: Hviid, A.; Bech Svalgaard, I.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301520\nBackgroundThe safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been extensively evaluated since the global rollout began. While serious adverse events are rare, safety issues continue to arise. This study evaluates the claim that earlier small vaccine batches were associated with higher rates of serious adverse events compared to later batches. MethodsA nationwide cohort study was conducted in Denmark, comprising individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine from 52 pre-defined batches classified into three pre-defined groups. Vaccinated individuals were matched 1:1 between batch groups on age, sex, and vaccination priority group. The study outcomes, included 27 serious adverse events, 2 negative control outcomes and all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing rates between batch groups in the 28-days following vaccination. We conducted two comparisons of the early small batches to two groups of larger batches used later in the pandemic. ResultsIn the study period, 9,983,448 vaccinations were administered from batches in the three pre-defined groups. Slightly increased rates of arrhythmia were observed in both study comparisons, HRs 1.25 (95% CI,1.05-1.50) and 1.15 (1.00-1.31), respectively, but sensitivity analyses did not robustly support these associations. For the remaining outcomes, increased rates in both study comparisons were not observed. ConclusionThis nationwide cohort study provides reassurance regarding the safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine across different batches used in Denmark. The findings support the overall safety of the vaccine, with no clinically relevant variations in serious adverse event rates between batches.\nExploring the changing association between parental and adolescent fruit and vegetable intakes, from age 10 to 30 years.\nAuthors: Braune, T.; Adams, J.; Winpenny, E. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301777\nBackgroundAdolescence is a pivotal developmental stage, where escalating rates of overweight and obesity have raised concerns about diet quality and its association with adverse health outcomes. Parents are known to have considerable influence on childhood diet, but how this influence changes as adolescents mature is unknown. This study investigates the association between parental fruit and vegetable (FV) intake and adolescent FV consumption, exploring how this changes across adolescence and when children leave home. MethodsAdolescents aged 10-30 years (n=12,805) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), and their parents, reported FV intakes every 2 years. Multilevel linear regression models were fitted to assess associations between parental and adolescent FV intakes, investigating interactions with age and living arrangement, and adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. ResultsParental FV intake was positively associated with adolescent FV intake ({beta}=0.20 [95%CI:0.19,0.22] portions/day), with the strength of this association lowest during early adolescence (10-14 years) and peaking at 17-18 years ({beta}=0.30 [95%CI: 0.27,0.33] portions/day). When adolescents no longer lived in the parental home, the association of parental FV intake with their own FV consumption decreased, but a positive association was maintained up to age 30 years. ConclusionsOur findings emphasise the enduring effect of parental modelling on dietary choices, highlighting the potential for interventions to promote increased FV intake, acknowledging the lasting influence of parental diet, even beyond the confines of the parental home.\nInequalities in local funding cuts to environmental and regulatory service expenditure in England from 2009 to 2020\nAuthors: Murrell, L.; Fahy, K.; Clough, H. E.; Gibb, R.; Zhang, X.; Chattaway, M.; Green, M. A.; Buchan, I.; Barr, B.; Hungerford, D.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301656\nBackgroundLocal authorities have been subject to substantial reductions in funding, placing strain on local services. Environmental and Regulatory (ER) services provide essential functions including infectious disease prevention and control via Food Safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control services (APHIDC). This study investigates inequalities in local funding cuts to these services. MethodsWe used a generalised estimating equation model to estimate the annual percent change of ER service expenditure between 2009/10 and 2020/21 in addition to Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure change overall, and as a share of total ER expenditure. Models analysed trends by deprivation level, local authority structure and population density. ResultsAreas of higher deprivation had the largest reduction in expenditure, with ER and Food Safety and APHIDC cuts of 2% and of 23% respectively, compared to a 1% and 8% reduction in the least deprived areas. The share of ER expenditure spent on Food Safety and APHIDC decreased by 13% in the most deprived authorities compared to 6% in the least deprived areas. Environmental and Regulatory services saw the largest cuts in unitary authorities, declining by 2%. London boroughs had the greatest reductions in Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure, decreasing by 10%. Both ER and Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure decreased with increasing population density. ConclusionThe unequal distribution of cuts shows the need for increased and equitable investment into these services to enable resilience to emerging infectious disease threats, and to prevent widening of health inequalities. Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAusterity measures have led to substantial reductions in local funding placing increased pressure on local authority services in England, research shows reductions vary by deprivation level of an area, rural - urban classification and local authority structure. C_LIO_LIIt is unknown how local funding cuts to Environmental and Regulatory services, which provide essential services for public health protection, vary by these characteristics. C_LI What this study addsO_LIWe investigate inequalities in austerity-enforced changes in Environmental and Regulatory service expenditure and sub-spending lines of Food Safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control over time by deprivation, local authority structure and population density from 2009/10 to 2020/21. C_LIO_LIThe largest cuts were in the more deprived areas and with increased population density for both Environmental and Regulatory and Food safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control services. The largest cuts in Environmental and Regulatory services were seen in unitary authorities whereas Food safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control saw largest cuts in London boroughs. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policyO_LIThis research provides strong evidence of inequalities in local authority service expenditure in Environmental and Regulatory services and highlights where investment should be focused, in order to protect environmental and public health. C_LI\nEpidemiological model can forecast COVID-19 outbreaks from wastewater-based surveillance in rural communities.\nAuthors: Meadows, T.; Coats, E. R.; Narum, S.; Top, E.; Ridenhour, B. J.; Stalder, T.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24302131\nWastewater can play a vital role in infectious disease surveillance, especially in underserved communities where it can reduce the equity gap to larger municipalities. However, using wastewater surveillance in a predictive manner remains a challenge. We tested if detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can predict outbreaks in rural communities. Under the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance program, we monitored several rural communities in Idaho (USA). While high daily variations in wastewater viral load made real-time interpretation difficult, a SEIR model could factor out the data noise and forecast the start of the Omicron outbreak in five of the six cities that were sampled soon after SARS-CoV-2 quantities increased in wastewater. For one city, the model could predict an outbreak 11 days before reported clinical cases began to increase. An epidemiological modeling approach can transform how epidemiologists use wastewater data to provide public health guidance on infectious diseases in rural communities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Two papers authored by the same research group were published in academic journals in October 2023, both of which simulate counterfactual COVID-19 cases and deaths using transmission models. One paper estimates that the COVID-19 cases and deaths from Feb 17 to Nov 30, 2021 in Japan would have been as many as 63.3 million and 364 thousand respectively had the vaccination not been implemented, where the 95% confidence interval is claimed to be less than 1% of the estimated value. It also claims that the cases and deaths could have been reduced by 54% and 48% respectively had the vaccination been implemented 14 days earlier. The other paper estimates that the number of cases in early 2022, Tokyo would have been larger than the number of populations in the age group under 49 in the absence of the vaccination program. In this paper, we reexamine the results given by these papers to find that the simulation results do not explain the real-world data in Japan including prefectures with early/late vaccination schedules. The cause of discrepancy is identified as low reliability of model parameters that immensely affect the simulation results of case and death counts. Leaders of public healthcare are required to discern the reliability and credibility of simulation studies and to prepare for variety of possible scenarios when reliable predictions are not available.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance using RT-qPCR has now been widely adopted to track circulating levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus in many sewer sheds. The CDC qPCR assays targeting two regions (N1 and N2) within the N gene are commonly used, but a discrepancy between the two biomarkers has been noticed by many groups using this method since late 2021. The reason is presumed to be due to mutations in regions targeted by the qPCR probe. In this study, we systematically investigated and unequivocally confirmed that the underlying reason for this discrepancy was mutations in the N1 probe target, and that a single mutation could cause a significant drop in signal. We first confirmed the proportion of related mutations in wastewater samples (Jan 2021-Dec 2022) using nested PCR and LC-MS. Based on relative proportion of N1 alleles, we separated the wastewater data into four time periods corresponding to different variant waves: Period I (Alpha and Delta waves with 0 mutation), Period II (BA.1/BA.2 wave with a single mutation found in all Omicron strains), Period III (BA. 5.2* wave with two mutations), and Period IV (BQ.1* wave with two mutations). Significantly lower N1 copies relative to N2 copies in samples from Periods II-IV compared to those from Period I was observed in wastewater. To further pinpoint the extent to which each mutation impacted N1 quantification, we compared the qPCR response among different synthetic oligomers with corresponding mutations. This study highlighted the impact of even just one or two mutations on qPCR-based wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate timely reporting of clinical trial results at medical universities and university hospitals in the Nordic countries.

Study Design and SettingIn this cross-sectional study, we included trials (regardless of intervention) registered in the EU Clinical Trials Registry and/or ClinicalTrials.gov, completed 2016-2019, and led by a university with medical faculty or university hospital in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden. We identified summary results posted at the trial registries, and conducted systematic manual searches for results publications (e.g., journal articles, preprints). We present proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and medians with interquartile range (IQR). Protocol: https://osf.io/wua3r

ResultsAmong 2,113 included clinical trials, 1,638 (77.5%, 95%CI 75.9-79.2%) reported any results during our follow-up; 1,092 (51.7%, 95%CI 49.5-53.8%) reported any results within 2 years of the global completion date; and 42 (2%, 95%CI 1.5-2.7%) posted summary results in the registry within 1 year. Median time from global completion date to results reporting was 698 days (IQR 1,123). 856/1,681 (50.9%) of ClinicalTrials.gov-registrations were prospective. Denmark contributed approximately half of all trials. Reporting performance varied widely between institutions.

ConclusionMissing and delayed results reporting of academically-led clinical trials is a pervasive problem in the Nordic countries. We relied on trial registry information, which can be incomplete. Institutions, funders, and policy makers need to support trial teams, ensure regulation adherence, and secure trial reporting before results are permanently lost.

What is new?- Many Nordic registered clinical trials were reported late or not at all.
- Almost one in four trials remained unreported at the end of our search period.
- About half of registered trials had reported results two years after completion.
- Only 2% of trials posted summary results in the registry one year after completion.
- Concerted action is needed to improve reporting of Nordic clinical trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter &#34;CAT&#34;) reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023.

MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [&amp;ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [&amp;ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [&amp;ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period.

InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest.

Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [&amp;ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [&amp;ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [&amp;ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Summary Background: Studies into the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long COVID have been limited by retrospective pre-infection sleep data and infrequent post-infection follow-up. We therefore used prospectively collected monthly data to evaluate how pre-infection sleep characteristics affect risk of long COVID, and to track changes in sleep duration during the year after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: COVIDENCE UK is a prospective, population-based UK study of COVID-19 in adults. We included non-hospitalised participants with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for the association between pre-infection sleep characteristics and long COVID using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. We assessed changes in sleep duration after infection using multilevel mixed models. We defined long COVID as unresolved symptoms at least 12 weeks after infection. We defined sleep quality according to age-dependent combinations of sleep duration and efficiency. COVIDENCE UK is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04330599. Findings: We included 3994 participants in our long COVID risk analysis, of whom 327 (8.2%) reported long COVID. We found an inverse relationship between pre-infection sleep quality and risk of long COVID (medium vs good quality: OR 1.37[95% CI 1.04-1.81]; medium-low vs good: 1.55 [1.12-2.16]; low vs good: 1.94 [1.11-3.38]). Greater variability in pre-infection sleep efficiency was also associated with long COVID (OR per percentage-point increase 1.06 [1.01-1.11]). We assessed post-infection sleep duration in 6860 participants, observing a 0.11 h (95% CI 0.08-0.13) increase in the first month after infection compared with pre-infection, with larger increases for more severe infections. After 1 month, sleep duration largely returned to pre-infection levels, although fluctuations in duration lasted up to 6 months after infection among people reporting long COVID. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the bidirectional relationship between sleep and long COVID. While poor-quality sleep before SARS-CoV-2 infection associates with increased risk of long COVID thereafter, changes in sleep duration after infection in these non-hospitalised cases were modest and generally quick to resolve.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1.1Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are summaries of an individuals personalized genetic risk for a trait or disease. However, PRS often perform poorly for phenotype prediction when the ancestry of the target population does not match the population in which GWAS effect sizes were estimated. For many populations this can be addressed by performing GWAS in the target population. However, admixed individuals (whose genomes can be traced to multiple ancestral populations) lie on an ancestry continuum and are not easily represented as a discrete population.

Here, we propose slaPRS (stacking local ancestry PRS), which incorporates multiple ancestry GWAS to alleviate the ancestry dependence of PRS in admixed samples. slaPRS uses ensemble learning (stacking) to combine local population specific PRS in regions across the genome. We compare slaPRS to single population PRS and a method that combines single population PRS globally. In simulations, slaPRS outperformed existing approaches and reduced the ancestry dependence of PRS in African Americans. In lipid traits from African British individuals (UK Biobank), slaPRS again improved on single population PRS while performing comparably to the globally combined PRS. slaPRS provides a data-driven and flexible framework to incorporate multiple population-specific GWAS and local ancestry in samples of admixed ancestry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been extensively evaluated since the global rollout began. While serious adverse events are rare, safety issues continue to arise. This study evaluates the claim that earlier small vaccine batches were associated with higher rates of serious adverse events compared to later batches.

MethodsA nationwide cohort study was conducted in Denmark, comprising individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine from 52 pre-defined batches classified into three pre-defined groups. Vaccinated individuals were matched 1:1 between batch groups on age, sex, and vaccination priority group. The study outcomes, included 27 serious adverse events, 2 negative control outcomes and all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing rates between batch groups in the 28-days following vaccination. We conducted two comparisons of the early small batches to two groups of larger batches used later in the pandemic.

ResultsIn the study period, 9,983,448 vaccinations were administered from batches in the three pre-defined groups. Slightly increased rates of arrhythmia were observed in both study comparisons, HRs 1.25 (95% CI,1.05-1.50) and 1.15 (1.00-1.31), respectively, but sensitivity analyses did not robustly support these associations. For the remaining outcomes, increased rates in both study comparisons were not observed.

ConclusionThis nationwide cohort study provides reassurance regarding the safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine across different batches used in Denmark. The findings support the overall safety of the vaccine, with no clinically relevant variations in serious adverse event rates between batches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAdolescence is a pivotal developmental stage, where escalating rates of overweight and obesity have raised concerns about diet quality and its association with adverse health outcomes. Parents are known to have considerable influence on childhood diet, but how this influence changes as adolescents mature is unknown. This study investigates the association between parental fruit and vegetable (FV) intake and adolescent FV consumption, exploring how this changes across adolescence and when children leave home.

MethodsAdolescents aged 10-30 years (n=12,805) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), and their parents, reported FV intakes every 2 years. Multilevel linear regression models were fitted to assess associations between parental and adolescent FV intakes, investigating interactions with age and living arrangement, and adjusting for sociodemographic covariates.

ResultsParental FV intake was positively associated with adolescent FV intake ({beta}=0.20 [95%CI:0.19,0.22] portions/day), with the strength of this association lowest during early adolescence (10-14 years) and peaking at 17-18 years ({beta}=0.30 [95%CI: 0.27,0.33] portions/day). When adolescents no longer lived in the parental home, the association of parental FV intake with their own FV consumption decreased, but a positive association was maintained up to age 30 years.

ConclusionsOur findings emphasise the enduring effect of parental modelling on dietary choices, highlighting the potential for interventions to promote increased FV intake, acknowledging the lasting influence of parental diet, even beyond the confines of the parental home.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLocal authorities have been subject to substantial reductions in funding, placing strain on local services. Environmental and Regulatory (ER) services provide essential functions including infectious disease prevention and control via Food Safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control services (APHIDC). This study investigates inequalities in local funding cuts to these services.

MethodsWe used a generalised estimating equation model to estimate the annual percent change of ER service expenditure between 2009/10 and 2020/21 in addition to Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure change overall, and as a share of total ER expenditure. Models analysed trends by deprivation level, local authority structure and population density.

ResultsAreas of higher deprivation had the largest reduction in expenditure, with ER and Food Safety and APHIDC cuts of 2% and of 23% respectively, compared to a 1% and 8% reduction in the least deprived areas. The share of ER expenditure spent on Food Safety and APHIDC decreased by 13% in the most deprived authorities compared to 6% in the least deprived areas. Environmental and Regulatory services saw the largest cuts in unitary authorities, declining by 2%. London boroughs had the greatest reductions in Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure, decreasing by 10%. Both ER and Food Safety and APHIDC expenditure decreased with increasing population density.

ConclusionThe unequal distribution of cuts shows the need for increased and equitable investment into these services to enable resilience to emerging infectious disease threats, and to prevent widening of health inequalities.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSO_LIAusterity measures have led to substantial reductions in local funding placing increased pressure on local authority services in England, research shows reductions vary by deprivation level of an area, rural - urban classification and local authority structure.
C_LIO_LIIt is unknown how local funding cuts to Environmental and Regulatory services, which provide essential services for public health protection, vary by these characteristics.

What this study addsO_LIWe investigate inequalities in austerity-enforced changes in Environmental and Regulatory service expenditure and sub-spending lines of Food Safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control over time by deprivation, local authority structure and population density from 2009/10 to 2020/21.
C_LIO_LIThe largest cuts were in the more deprived areas and with increased population density for both Environmental and Regulatory and Food safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control services. The largest cuts in Environmental and Regulatory services were seen in unitary authorities whereas Food safety and Animal and Public Health Infectious Disease Control saw largest cuts in London boroughs.

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater can play a vital role in infectious disease surveillance, especially in underserved communities where it can reduce the equity gap to larger municipalities. However, using wastewater surveillance in a predictive manner remains a challenge. We tested if detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can predict outbreaks in rural communities. Under the CDC National Wastewater Surveillance program, we monitored several rural communities in Idaho (USA). While high daily variations in wastewater viral load made real-time interpretation difficult, a SEIR model could factor out the data noise and forecast the start of the Omicron outbreak in five of the six cities that were sampled soon after SARS-CoV-2 quantities increased in wastewater. For one city, the model could predict an outbreak 11 days before reported clinical cases began to increase. An epidemiological modeling approach can transform how epidemiologists use wastewater data to provide public health guidance on infectious diseases in rural communities.</p>
