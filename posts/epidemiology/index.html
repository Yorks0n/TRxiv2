T.; Mukherjee, B.\nScore: 66.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291692\nBackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear. MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset. ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death). Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome. ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.\nPatterns in Repeat Reinfections: Pre and Post Omicron Emergence\nAuthors: Chemaitelly, H.; Ayoub, H.; Tang, P.; Coyle, P.; YASSINE, H. M.; Althani, A.; Hasan, M. R.; Al-Kanaani, Z.; Al-Kuwari, E.; Jeremijenko, A.; Kaleeckal, A. H.; Latif, A. N.; Shaik, R. M.; Abdul-Rahim, H. F.; Nasrallah, G. K.; Al-Kuwari, M. G.; Butt, A. A.; Al-Romaihi, H. E.; Al-Thani, M. H.; Al-Khal, A.; Bertollini, R.; Abu-Raddad, L. J.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23292041\nOur understanding of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection patterns remains limited. We conducted a longitudinal study using Qatars national SARS-CoV-2 data from February 28, 2020 to June 11, 2023 to investigate incidence of reinfections both prior to and after omicron emergence. The latter analysis excluded individuals with pre-omicron infections. Before omicron introduction, the proportion of incident infections classified as reinfections gradually increased but remained minimal, reaching 1.8% just before omicron emerged. During the first omicron wave, this proportion reached 9.0%, a 5-fold increase. After the conclusion of the first omicron wave, the proportion of incident infections identified as reinfections rapidly increased, reaching 43.3% towards the end of the study. In the pre-omicron era, a total of 3,131 reinfections were documented, of which 99.6% were first reinfections and 0.4% were second reinfections. Meanwhile, a total of 20,962 reinfections were documented after an omicron primary infection of which 99.0% were first reinfections, 1.0% were second reinfections, and 0.01% were third reinfections. Reinfections were rare before omicrons emergence but became widespread during the omicron era, including among individuals previously infected with omicron. Our findings may indicate accelerated viral evolution in the omicron era aimed at evading population immunity, but with minimal impact on COVID-19 severity, or potentially suggest immune imprinting effects that require further investigation.\nUnraveling the Decline: Search for Factors Behind the Trend in Parkinsons Disease Incidence Rates: A Cohort Study of German Health Claims Data\nAuthors: Fink, A.; Pavlou, M. A.; Roomp, K.; Doblhammer, G.; Schneider, J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23291993\nSporadic Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in older age. Recent studies have led to a debate regarding trends in incidence and prevalence. We aimed to investigate age-specific incidence rates of PD and possible explanations for the observed trend in Germany by studying two randomly selected longitudinal cohorts, each consisting of 250,000 individuals aged 50 and above. We started observing them at the beginning of 2004 and 2014, and followed them through the end of 2009 and 2019, respectively. We compared age-specific incidence rates for both cohorts and performed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of PD in the second period compared with the first period ten years earlier, adjusted for age, sex, and several prodromal factors, comorbidities, and risk factors of PD. For each age-group in men and women, we found lower age-specific PD incidence rates in the second period, except for the lowest age-group (50-54) in men. Cox regression analysis demonstrated an overall 20% risk reduction of PD incidence (HR=0.80, 95% confidence interval [0.75-0.86]). Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (+1.98 years) and women (+0,87 years). Stepwise adjustment for prodromal symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors revealed a 22%-49% risk reduction of PD incidence. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed a 48% risk reduction (HR=0.52 [0.48-0.56]), demonstrating the independence of the time trends from changes in death rates. In conclusion, our data show that the risk of PD has decreased over time, and that this decrease is independent of factors such as changes in death rates, age structure, sex, motor and sensory impairments, sleep and psychiatric conditions, comorbidities, and specific risk factors.\nSpatial and temporal clustering of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats, 2021- 2023\nAuthors: Chen, C.; Martins, M.; Yettapu, D.; Diel, D.; Jennifer, R.; Urbasic, A.; Robinson, H.; Varga, C.; Fang, Y.\nScore: 34.2, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.23291564\nIn this study, we evaluated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats from October 2021 to May 2023. Among 1,715 samples tested by serological assays, 244 samples (14%) tested positive. High-rate temporal, spatial, and space-time clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were assessed within 63 counties in Illinois. Three space-time clusters with higher than expected seroprevalence rates were identified in the northeastern, central-east, and southwest regions of Illinois, occurring between June and October 2022. Young cats had a higher rate of seropositivity compared to older cats, and the third quarter of the year had the highest seropositivity rate. This study provides an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Illinois household cats, which will aid in COVID-19 control and prevention. Article summary lineSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was assessed in Illinois domestic cats, in which a higher seropositivity rate was clustered in the northern, central, and southern Illinois regions with peak periods occurring between June and October 2022.\nComparison of control and transmission of COVID-19 across epidemic waves in Hong Kong: an observational study\nAuthors: Yang, B.; Lin, Y.; Xiong, W.; Liu, C.; Gao, H.; Ho, F.; Zhou, J.; Zhang, R.; Wong, J.; Cheung, J.; Lau, E.; Tsang, T.; Xiao, J.; Wong, I.; Martin-Sanchez, M.; Leung, G.; Cowling, B. J.; Wu, P.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291593\nBackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter. MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults. FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (\u003e70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [\u0026ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks. InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.\nIncreasing burden of opioid overdose mortality in the United States: Years of life lost by age, race, and state from 2019-2021\nAuthors: Hebert, A. H.; Hill, A. L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292297\nThe United States' opioid crisis is worsening, but the nationwide burden has not been characterized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we calculate years of life lost to opioid overdose deaths by demographic group and examine trends from 2019 to 2021. Using the Multiple Cause of Death dataset from CDC WONDER, we extracted opioid overdose deaths stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and state, and estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates, years of life lost, and reduction in life expectancy at birth. Increasing annually, opioid overdose deaths reached 80,411 in 2021, leading to 3 million years of life lost, and reducing life expectancy by 0.65 years. From 2019 to 2021, opioid overdose death rates increased across all groups. American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American men now experience the highest burden, with 1,500 years of life lost per 100,000, life expectancies at birth reduced by almost 1 year, and 46 and 51 deaths per 100,000, respectively. This study highlights the continued growth of the opioid crisis, and the surge in years of life lost coinciding with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions, particularly in light of this epidemic's changing demographics.\nComparing reactions to COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations: data from patient self-reporting, smartwatches and electronic health records\nAuthors: Yechezkel, M.; Qian, G.; Levi, Y.; Davidovitch, N.; Shmueli, E.; Yamin, D.; L. Brandeau, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.23292007\nBackgroundPublic reluctance to receive COVID-19 vaccination is due in large part to safety concerns. We compare the safety profile of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 booster vaccine to that of the seasonal influenza vaccine, which has been administered for decades with a solid safety record and a high level of public acceptance. MethodsWe study a prospective cohort of 5,079 participants in Israel (the PerMed study) and a retrospective cohort of 250,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services. We examine reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccinations and to influenza vaccination. All prospective cohort participants wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and completed a daily questionnaire via smartphone. For the prospective cohort, we compare pre-vaccination (baseline) and post-vaccination smartwatch heart rate data and a stress measure based on heart rate variability, and we examine symptom severity from patient self-reports. For the retrospective cohort, we examine electronic health records (EHRs) for the existence of 28 potential adverse events during the 28-day period before and after each vaccination. FindingsIn the prospective cohort, 1,905 participants received COVID-19 vaccination; 899 received influenza vaccination. Focusing on those who received both vaccines yielded a total of 689 participants in the prospective cohort and 31,297 members in the retrospective cohort. Questionnaire analysis: For the COVID-19 vaccine, 39{middle dot}7% [95% CI 36{middle dot}4%-42{middle dot}9%] of individuals reported no systemic reaction vs. 66{middle dot}9% [95% CI 63{middle dot}4%-70{middle dot}3%] for the influenza vaccine. Individuals reporting a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tended to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination (r=0{middle dot}185, p\u003c0{middle dot}001). Smartwatch analysis: A statistically significant increase in heart rate and stress measure occurred during the first 3 days after COVID-19 vaccination, peaking 22 hours after vaccination with a mean increase of 4{middle dot}48 (95% CI 3{middle dot}94-5{middle dot}01) beats per minute and 9{middle dot}34 (95% CI 8{middle dot}31-10{middle dot}37) units in the stress measure compared to baseline. For influenza vaccination, we observed no changes in heart rate or stress measures. In paired analysis, the increase in both heart rate and stress measure for each participant was higher (p-value \u003c 0{middle dot}001) for COVID-19 vaccination than for influenza vaccination in the first 2 days after vaccination. On the second day after vaccination, participants had 1{middle dot}5 (95% CI 0{middle dot}68-2{middle dot}20) more heartbeats per minute and 3{middle dot}8 (95% CI 2{middle dot}27-5{middle dot}22) units higher stress measure, compared to their baseline. These differences disappeared by the third day after vaccination. EHR analysis: We found no elevated risk of non-COVID-19 or - influenza hospitalization following either vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any of the adverse events examined. Influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of Bells palsy (1{middle dot}3 [95% CI 0{middle dot}3-2{middle dot}6] additional events per 10,000 people). InterpretationThe more pronounced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination compared to influenza vaccination may explain the greater concern regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, our findings support the safety profile of both vaccines, as the reported side effects and physiological reactions measured by the smartwatches faded shortly after inoculation, and no substantial increase in adverse events was detected in the retrospective cohort. FundingThis work was supported by the European Research Council, project #949850, and a Koret Foundation gift for Smart Cities and Digital Living. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this studyThe unprecedented global impact of COVID-19 led to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines against the virus, including vaccines using novel mRNA technology. Despite the promising effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing severe outcomes of COVID-19, concerns have been raised regarding the safety profile of these new vaccines. These concerns led to a notable global public reluctance to become vaccinated. By contrast, the seasonal influenza vaccine has been administered for decades with a well-established safety record and a high level of public acceptance. We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and preprint services (including medRxiv, bioRrxiv, and SSRN) for studies comparing the safety profile of the two vaccines between March 1, 2023 (our studys launch) and May 30, 2023, with no language restrictions, using the terms \"safety of\" AND (\"COVID-19\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\") AND (\"vaccine\" OR \"BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine\") AND \"compared to\" AND (\"Influenza\" OR \"seasonal influenza\" OR \"flu\") AND \"vaccine\". We found a study that compared the safety profile of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine among 18,755 recipients with 27,895 recipients of the seasonal influenza vaccine using the WHO international database. The authors found a different safety pattern between the two vaccines with more systematic reactions following inoculation of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular adverse events, while the influenza vaccine was associated with a higher risk of neurological adverse events. The remaining studies identified in our search compared the simultaneous administration of both vaccines to the administration of only COVID-19 vaccines. None of the studies conducted a paired analysis that compared reactions post-influenza vaccination and post-COVID-19 vaccination for the same individual; none examined the extent of physiological reaction (in terms of heart rate and heart rate variability) following the administration of COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccines; and none examined a cohort of individuals with data from before and after vaccination episodes or presented a comprehensive analysis to address concerns regarding the existence of potential rare adverse events following vaccination. Added value of this studyWe studied a prospective cohort of 5,079 participants in Israel (the PerMed study) from October 31, 2020 to September 30, 2022 and a retrospective cohort of 250,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services from July 31, 2021 and March 1, 2023. We examined reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (third or fourth shot) and to influenza vaccination. We compared the extent of reactions at the individual level, among individuals who received both vaccines separately. While the self-reported data and the continuous physiological measures from smartwatches revealed a higher rate of reactions following COVID-19 vaccination, these reactions faded soon after inoculation. We found no increase in risk of rare adverse events for either vaccine. We found a weak, albeit significant, correlation in the severity of the symptoms for the two vaccines (r=0{middle dot}185, p\u003c0{middle dot}001): individuals who reported a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tended to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination. We found no elevated risk of non-COVID-19 or - influenza hospitalization following the administration of either vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with increased risk of any of the adverse events examined. Influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of Bells palsy (1{middle dot}3 [95% CI 0{middle dot}3-2{middle dot}6] additional events per 10,000 people). Implications of all the available evidenceOur study demonstrates the importance of accounting for continuous and objective surveillance of vaccines in both the clinical trial phase and the post-marketing phase, as it can aid in evaluating the safety profile of clinical trials and reduce vaccine hesitancy. The more pronounced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination compared to influenza vaccination may explain the greater concern regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, our findings support the safety profile of both vaccines, as the reported side effects and physiological reactions measured by the smartwatches faded shortly after inoculation, and no substantial increase in adverse events was detected in the retrospective cohort.\nSpatio-temporal surveillance and early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern\nAuthors: Cavallaro, M.; Dyson, L.; Tildesley, M.

J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292295\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterized by the repeated emergence of genetically distinct virus variants of increased transmissibility and immune evasion compared to pre-existing lineages. In many countries, their containment required the intervention of public health authorities and the imposition of control measures. While the primary role of testing is to identify infection, target treatment, and limit spread (through isolation and contact tracing), a secondary benefit is in terms of surveillance and the early detection of new variants. Here we study the spatial invasion and early spread of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) variants in England from September 2020 to February 2022 using the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) method, a statistical technique for the detection of aberrations in spatial point processes, applied to community PCR (polymerase-chain-reaction) test data where the TaqPath kit provides a proxy measure of the switch between variants. The application of RaNCover method could rapidly detect outbreaks of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and hence inform optimal spatial interventions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear.

MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset.

ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death).

Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome.

ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection patterns remains limited. We conducted a longitudinal study using Qatars national SARS-CoV-2 data from February 28, 2020 to June 11, 2023 to investigate incidence of reinfections both prior to and after omicron emergence. The latter analysis excluded individuals with pre-omicron infections. Before omicron introduction, the proportion of incident infections classified as reinfections gradually increased but remained minimal, reaching 1.8% just before omicron emerged. During the first omicron wave, this proportion reached 9.0%, a 5-fold increase. After the conclusion of the first omicron wave, the proportion of incident infections identified as reinfections rapidly increased, reaching 43.3% towards the end of the study. In the pre-omicron era, a total of 3,131 reinfections were documented, of which 99.6% were first reinfections and 0.4% were second reinfections. Meanwhile, a total of 20,962 reinfections were documented after an omicron primary infection of which 99.0% were first reinfections, 1.0% were second reinfections, and 0.01% were third reinfections. Reinfections were rare before omicrons emergence but became widespread during the omicron era, including among individuals previously infected with omicron. Our findings may indicate accelerated viral evolution in the omicron era aimed at evading population immunity, but with minimal impact on COVID-19 severity, or potentially suggest immune imprinting effects that require further investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in older age. Recent studies have led to a debate regarding trends in incidence and prevalence. We aimed to investigate age-specific incidence rates of PD and possible explanations for the observed trend in Germany by studying two randomly selected longitudinal cohorts, each consisting of 250,000 individuals aged 50 and above. We started observing them at the beginning of 2004 and 2014, and followed them through the end of 2009 and 2019, respectively. We compared age-specific incidence rates for both cohorts and performed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of PD in the second period compared with the first period ten years earlier, adjusted for age, sex, and several prodromal factors, comorbidities, and risk factors of PD. For each age-group in men and women, we found lower age-specific PD incidence rates in the second period, except for the lowest age-group (50-54) in men. Cox regression analysis demonstrated an overall 20% risk reduction of PD incidence (HR=0.80, 95% confidence interval [0.75-0.86]). Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (&#43;1.98 years) and women (&#43;0,87 years). Stepwise adjustment for prodromal symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors revealed a 22%-49% risk reduction of PD incidence. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed a 48% risk reduction (HR=0.52 [0.48-0.56]), demonstrating the independence of the time trends from changes in death rates. In conclusion, our data show that the risk of PD has decreased over time, and that this decrease is independent of factors such as changes in death rates, age structure, sex, motor and sensory impairments, sleep and psychiatric conditions, comorbidities, and specific risk factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this study, we evaluated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats from October 2021 to May 2023. Among 1,715 samples tested by serological assays, 244 samples (14%) tested positive. High-rate temporal, spatial, and space-time clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were assessed within 63 counties in Illinois. Three space-time clusters with higher than expected seroprevalence rates were identified in the northeastern, central-east, and southwest regions of Illinois, occurring between June and October 2022. Young cats had a higher rate of seropositivity compared to older cats, and the third quarter of the year had the highest seropositivity rate. This study provides an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Illinois household cats, which will aid in COVID-19 control and prevention.

Article summary lineSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was assessed in Illinois domestic cats, in which a higher seropositivity rate was clustered in the northern, central, and southern Illinois regions with peak periods occurring between June and October 2022.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter.

MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults.

FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (&gt;70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [&amp;ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks.

InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The United States&#39; opioid crisis is worsening, but the nationwide burden has not been characterized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we calculate years of life lost to opioid overdose deaths by demographic group and examine trends from 2019 to 2021. Using the Multiple Cause of Death dataset from CDC WONDER, we extracted opioid overdose deaths stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and state, and estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates, years of life lost, and reduction in life expectancy at birth. Increasing annually, opioid overdose deaths reached 80,411 in 2021, leading to 3 million years of life lost, and reducing life expectancy by 0.65 years. From 2019 to 2021, opioid overdose death rates increased across all groups. American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American men now experience the highest burden, with 1,500 years of life lost per 100,000, life expectancies at birth reduced by almost 1 year, and 46 and 51 deaths per 100,000, respectively. This study highlights the continued growth of the opioid crisis, and the surge in years of life lost coinciding with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions, particularly in light of this epidemic&#39;s changing demographics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPublic reluctance to receive COVID-19 vaccination is due in large part to safety concerns. We compare the safety profile of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 booster vaccine to that of the seasonal influenza vaccine, which has been administered for decades with a solid safety record and a high level of public acceptance.

MethodsWe study a prospective cohort of 5,079 participants in Israel (the PerMed study) and a retrospective cohort of 250,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services. We examine reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccinations and to influenza vaccination. All prospective cohort participants wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and completed a daily questionnaire via smartphone. For the prospective cohort, we compare pre-vaccination (baseline) and post-vaccination smartwatch heart rate data and a stress measure based on heart rate variability, and we examine symptom severity from patient self-reports. For the retrospective cohort, we examine electronic health records (EHRs) for the existence of 28 potential adverse events during the 28-day period before and after each vaccination.

FindingsIn the prospective cohort, 1,905 participants received COVID-19 vaccination; 899 received influenza vaccination. Focusing on those who received both vaccines yielded a total of 689 participants in the prospective cohort and 31,297 members in the retrospective cohort. Questionnaire analysis: For the COVID-19 vaccine, 39{middle dot}7% [95% CI 36{middle dot}4%-42{middle dot}9%] of individuals reported no systemic reaction vs. 66{middle dot}9% [95% CI 63{middle dot}4%-70{middle dot}3%] for the influenza vaccine. Individuals reporting a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tended to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination (r=0{middle dot}185, p&lt;0{middle dot}001). Smartwatch analysis: A statistically significant increase in heart rate and stress measure occurred during the first 3 days after COVID-19 vaccination, peaking 22 hours after vaccination with a mean increase of 4{middle dot}48 (95% CI 3{middle dot}94-5{middle dot}01) beats per minute and 9{middle dot}34 (95% CI 8{middle dot}31-10{middle dot}37) units in the stress measure compared to baseline. For influenza vaccination, we observed no changes in heart rate or stress measures. In paired analysis, the increase in both heart rate and stress measure for each participant was higher (p-value &lt; 0{middle dot}001) for COVID-19 vaccination than for influenza vaccination in the first 2 days after vaccination. On the second day after vaccination, participants had 1{middle dot}5 (95% CI 0{middle dot}68-2{middle dot}20) more heartbeats per minute and 3{middle dot}8 (95% CI 2{middle dot}27-5{middle dot}22) units higher stress measure, compared to their baseline. These differences disappeared by the third day after vaccination. EHR analysis: We found no elevated risk of non-COVID-19 or - influenza hospitalization following either vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any of the adverse events examined. Influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of Bells palsy (1{middle dot}3 [95% CI 0{middle dot}3-2{middle dot}6] additional events per 10,000 people).

InterpretationThe more pronounced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination compared to influenza vaccination may explain the greater concern regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, our findings support the safety profile of both vaccines, as the reported side effects and physiological reactions measured by the smartwatches faded shortly after inoculation, and no substantial increase in adverse events was detected in the retrospective cohort.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Evidence before this studyThe unprecedented global impact of COVID-19 led to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines against the virus, including vaccines using novel mRNA technology. Despite the promising effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing severe outcomes of COVID-19, concerns have been raised regarding the safety profile of these new vaccines. These concerns led to a notable global public reluctance to become vaccinated. By contrast, the seasonal influenza vaccine has been administered for decades with a well-established safety record and a high level of public acceptance. We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and preprint services (including medRxiv, bioRrxiv, and SSRN) for studies comparing the safety profile of the two vaccines between March 1, 2023 (our studys launch) and May 30, 2023, with no language restrictions, using the terms &#34;safety of&#34; AND (&#34;COVID-19&#34; OR &#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34;) AND (&#34;vaccine&#34; OR &#34;BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA vaccine&#34;) AND &#34;compared to&#34; AND (&#34;Influenza&#34; OR &#34;seasonal influenza&#34; OR &#34;flu&#34;) AND &#34;vaccine&#34;. We found a study that compared the safety profile of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine among 18,755 recipients with 27,895 recipients of the seasonal influenza vaccine using the WHO international database. The authors found a different safety pattern between the two vaccines with more systematic reactions following inoculation of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular adverse events, while the influenza vaccine was associated with a higher risk of neurological adverse events. The remaining studies identified in our search compared the simultaneous administration of both vaccines to the administration of only COVID-19 vaccines. None of the studies conducted a paired analysis that compared reactions post-influenza vaccination and post-COVID-19 vaccination for the same individual; none examined the extent of physiological reaction (in terms of heart rate and heart rate variability) following the administration of COVID-19 or seasonal influenza vaccines; and none examined a cohort of individuals with data from before and after vaccination episodes or presented a comprehensive analysis to address concerns regarding the existence of potential rare adverse events following vaccination.

Added value of this studyWe studied a prospective cohort of 5,079 participants in Israel (the PerMed study) from October 31, 2020 to September 30, 2022 and a retrospective cohort of 250,000 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services from July 31, 2021 and March 1, 2023. We examined reactions to BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (third or fourth shot) and to influenza vaccination. We compared the extent of reactions at the individual level, among individuals who received both vaccines separately. While the self-reported data and the continuous physiological measures from smartwatches revealed a higher rate of reactions following COVID-19 vaccination, these reactions faded soon after inoculation. We found no increase in risk of rare adverse events for either vaccine. We found a weak, albeit significant, correlation in the severity of the symptoms for the two vaccines (r=0{middle dot}185, p&lt;0{middle dot}001): individuals who reported a more severe reaction after influenza vaccination tended to likewise report a more severe reaction after COVID-19 vaccination. We found no elevated risk of non-COVID-19 or - influenza hospitalization following the administration of either vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with increased risk of any of the adverse events examined. Influenza vaccination was associated with an increased risk of Bells palsy (1{middle dot}3 [95% CI 0{middle dot}3-2{middle dot}6] additional events per 10,000 people).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study demonstrates the importance of accounting for continuous and objective surveillance of vaccines in both the clinical trial phase and the post-marketing phase, as it can aid in evaluating the safety profile of clinical trials and reduce vaccine hesitancy. The more pronounced side effects after COVID-19 vaccination compared to influenza vaccination may explain the greater concern regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Nevertheless, our findings support the safety profile of both vaccines, as the reported side effects and physiological reactions measured by the smartwatches faded shortly after inoculation, and no substantial increase in adverse events was detected in the retrospective cohort.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterized by the repeated emergence of genetically distinct virus variants of increased transmissibility and immune evasion compared to pre-existing lineages. In many countries, their containment required the intervention of public health authorities and the imposition of control measures. While the primary role of testing is to identify infection, target treatment, and limit spread (through isolation and contact tracing), a secondary benefit is in terms of surveillance and the early detection of new variants. Here we study the spatial invasion and early spread of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) variants in England from September 2020 to February 2022 using the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) method, a statistical technique for the detection of aberrations in spatial point processes, applied to community PCR (polymerase-chain-reaction) test data where the TaqPath kit provides a proxy measure of the switch between variants. The application of RaNCover method could rapidly detect outbreaks of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and hence inform optimal spatial interventions.</p>
