H.\nScore: 258.7, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294204\nBackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors. MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex. ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [\u0026le;]60 years, [\u0026ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone. ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022. SettingCommunity Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received \u003e= 3 vaccine doses. Main outcome measuresPrevalence of Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression. Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p \u003c 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study. Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns \u003e=2 months after the acute illness. Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%). The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with \u003e=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare. The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.\nImproving estimates of epidemiological quantities by combining reported cases with wastewater data: a statistical framework with applications to COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand\nAuthors: Watson, L. M.; Plank, M. J.; Armstrong, B.; Chapman, J.; Hewitt, J.; Morris, H.; Orsi, A.; Bunce, M.; Donnelly, C. A.; Steyn, N.\nScore: 65.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294060\nBackgroundTimely and informed public health responses to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 necessitate reliable information about infection dynamics. The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by human behaviours. Here, we investigated how these two data sources can be combined to inform estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number, R, and track changes in the CAR over time. MethodsWe constructed a state-space model that we solved using sequential Monte Carlo methods. The observed data are the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence. The hidden states that we estimate are R and CAR. Model parameters are estimated using the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings algorithm. FindingsWe analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. Accounting for reduced CAR, we estimate that New Zealands second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022. The CAR in subsequent waves around November 2022 and April 2023 was estimated to be comparable to that in the second Omicron wave. InterpretationThis work on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to give insight into key epidemiological quantities. Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time, which may be increasingly useful as intensive pandemic surveillance programmes are wound down.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been a substantial increase in the number of publications focusing on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed for \"wastewater based epidemiology\" and found fewer than 10 papers per year prior to 2014 with a drastic increase to 463 in 2022. Approximately 52% of the WBE publications are related to COVID-19 (\"wastewater based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\")). Many studies have focused on detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems but only 10 have estimated the reproduction number (\"wastewater based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND \"reproduction number\"). No previous work has combined WBE with reported case data to estimate (relative) case ascertainment rate (\"waste-water based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND \"case ascertainment rate\"). Previous work has estimated the reproduction number from reported cases assuming constant under-ascertainment but the issue of time-varying case ascertainment has not yet been addressed, except to demonstrate the effect of a pre-determined change in case ascertainment. Added value of this studyWe present a model that, for the first time, enables reported case information to be combined with wastewater data to estimate epidemiology quantities. This work further demonstrates the utility of WBE; the reproduction number can be estimated in the absence of reported case information (although results are more reliable when case data are included), and wastewater data include information that, when combined with case data, can be used to estimate the time-varying relative case ascertainment rate. Implications of all the available evidenceIn order to make informed and timely public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. WBE provides a useful source of data that is not impacted by time-varying testing practices. Wastewater data can be quantitatively combined with case information to better understand the state of an epidemic. In order to determine the absolute case ascertainment rate (rather than the relative rate calculated in this work), there is a need for infection prevalence surveys to calibrate model results against.\nPost-COVID rebound of gonorrhoea in England\nAuthors: Fountain, H.; Migchelsen, S.; Charles, H.; Ram, T.; Fifer, H.; Mohammed, H.; Sinka, K.\nScore: 31.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294107\nWith the removal of all COVID-19 restrictions in July 2021, a marked increase in gonorrhoea diagnoses in England was observed. Investigations revealed increases have been widespread, particularly in young people aged 15-to-24 years. Testing numbers have not shown a corresponding increase and have remained below 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels. Ethical statementNo ethical approval was needed for this study as routine surveillance data was used. Funding statementNo funding was needed.

S.; Houston, D.; Alwan, N. A.; Martin, J.; Khunti, K.; Nafilyan, V.\nScore: 78.6, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.21.23287524\nBackgroundEvidence on the long-term employment consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking. We used data from a large, community-based sample in the UK to estimate associations between Long Covid and subsequent employment outcomes. MethodsThis was an observational, longitudinal study using a pre-post design. We included survey participants from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2022 when they were aged 16 to 64 years and not in full-time education. Using conditional logit modelling, we explored the time-varying relationship between Long Covid status [\u0026ge;]12 weeks after a first test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (reference: pre-infection) and labour market inactivity (neither working nor looking for work) or workplace absence lasting [\u0026ge;]4 weeks. ResultsOf 206,299 included participants (mean age 45 years, 54% female, 92% white), 15% were ever inactive in the labour market and 10% were ever long-term absent during follow-up. Compared with pre-infection, inactivity was higher in participants reporting Long Covid 30 to \u003c40 weeks (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.45; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.81) or 40 to \u003c52 weeks (1.34; 1.05 to 1.72) post-infection. Combining with official statistics on Long Covid prevalence, our estimates translate to 27,000 (95% CI: 6,000 to 47,000) working-age adults in the UK being inactive because of Long Covid in July 2022. ConclusionsLong Covid is likely to have contributed to reduced levels of participation in the UK labour market, though it is unlikely to be the sole driver. Further research is required to quantify the contribution of other factors, such as indirect health effects of the pandemic.\nSleep Regularity and Mortality: A Prospective Analysis in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Cribb, L.; Sha, R.; Yiallourou, S.; Grima, N. A.; Cavuoto, M.; Baril, A.-A.; Pase, M. P.\nScore: 58.3, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.14.23288550\nBackgroundIrregular sleep-wake timing may cause circadian disruption leading to several chronic age-related diseases. We examined the relationship between sleep regularity and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in 88,975 participants from the prospective UK Biobank cohort. MethodsThe sleep regularity index (SRI) was calculated as the probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep or awake) at any two time points 24 hours apart, averaged over 7-days of accelerometry (range 0-100, with 100 being perfectly regular). The SRI was related to the risk of mortality in time-to-event models. FindingsThe mean sample age was 62 years (SD, 8), 56% were women, and the median SRI was 60 (SD, 10). There were 3010 deaths during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years. Following adjustments for demographic and clinical variables, we identified a non-linear relationship between the SRI and all-cause mortality hazard (p [global test of spline term] \u003c 0{middle dot}001). Hazard Ratios, relative to the median SRI, were 1{middle dot}53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1{middle dot}41, 1{middle dot}66) for participants with SRI at the 5th percentile (SRI = 41) and 0{middle dot}90 (95% CI: 0{middle dot}81, 1{middle dot}00) for those with SRI at the 95th percentile (SRI = 75), respectively. Findings for CVD mortality and cancer mortality followed a similar pattern. ConclusionsIrregular sleep-wake patterns are associated with higher mortality risk.

To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections. MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups. ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic. ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes? FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections. MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.\nNon-linear mendelian randomization: evaluation of biases using negative controls with a focus on BMI and Vitamin D\nAuthors: Hamilton, F. W.; Hughes, D. A.; Spiller, W.; Tilling, K.; Davey Smith, G.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23293658\nMendelian randomisation (MR) is an established technique in epidemiological investigation, using the principle of random allocation of genetic variants at conception to generate predicted causal effects of an exposure on an outcome. Extensions to this technique include non-linear approaches, that allow for differential effects of the exposure on the outcome depending on the level of the exposure. One popular method is the residual approach, which allows for stratification of the exposure via the level of the exposure and generation of causal estimates within each stratum. These \"local\" causal estimates are then used to make inferences about non-linear associations. Recent work has identified that under certain situations this method can lead to estimates that are seriously biased, and a new method - the doubly-ranked method - has been introduced as a possibly more robust approach. In this paper, we perform an analysis using negative control outcomes using both methods and find biased estimates in certain situations. We suggest caution in use of these methods and, if used, the performance of a number of sanity checks such as negative control outcomes in their reporting.\nDrivers and impact of the early silent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha\nAuthors: Faucher, B.; Sabbatini, C. E.; Czuppon, P.; Kraemer, M. U. G.; Lemey, P.; Colizza, V.; Blanquart, F.; Boelle, P.-Y.; Poletto, C.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23293488\nSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) circulated cryptically before being identified as a threat, delaying interventions. Understanding the drivers of such silent spread and its epidemic impact is critical to inform future response planning. Here, we integrated spatio-temporal records of international mobility, local epidemic growth and genomic surveillance into a Bayesian framework to reconstruct the early dissemination of Alpha out of the UK in the first three months after emergence. We found that silent circulation lasted from days to months and was logarithmically associated with sequencing coverage. Social restrictions in certain countries likely slowed down the seeding of local transmission by weeks, mitigating the negative consequences of late detection.

The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear. MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type. FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19. InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea. Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population. Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained. No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia. Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable. We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection. Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors.

MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex.

ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [&amp;le;]60 years, [&amp;ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone.

ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo characterise Long COVID in a highly vaccinated population infected by Omicron.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022.

SettingCommunity

Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received &gt;= 3 vaccine doses.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence of  Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression.

Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p &lt; 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study.

Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns &gt;=2 months after the acute illness.

Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%).

The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with &gt;=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare.

The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTimely and informed public health responses to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 necessitate reliable information about infection dynamics. The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by human behaviours. Here, we investigated how these two data sources can be combined to inform estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number, R, and track changes in the CAR over time.

MethodsWe constructed a state-space model that we solved using sequential Monte Carlo methods. The observed data are the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence. The hidden states that we estimate are R and CAR. Model parameters are estimated using the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

FindingsWe analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. Accounting for reduced CAR, we estimate that New Zealands second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022. The CAR in subsequent waves around November 2022 and April 2023 was estimated to be comparable to that in the second Omicron wave.

InterpretationThis work on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to give insight into key epidemiological quantities. Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time, which may be increasingly useful as intensive pandemic surveillance programmes are wound down.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been a substantial increase in the number of publications focusing on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed for &#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; and found fewer than 10 papers per year prior to 2014 with a drastic increase to 463 in 2022. Approximately 52% of the WBE publications are related to COVID-19 (&#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;)). Many studies have focused on detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems but only 10 have estimated the reproduction number (&#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;) AND &#34;reproduction number&#34;). No previous work has combined WBE with reported case data to estimate (relative) case ascertainment rate (&#34;waste-water based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;) AND &#34;case ascertainment rate&#34;). Previous work has estimated the reproduction number from reported cases assuming constant under-ascertainment but the issue of time-varying case ascertainment has not yet been addressed, except to demonstrate the effect of a pre-determined change in case ascertainment.

Added value of this studyWe present a model that, for the first time, enables reported case information to be combined with wastewater data to estimate epidemiology quantities. This work further demonstrates the utility of WBE; the reproduction number can be estimated in the absence of reported case information (although results are more reliable when case data are included), and wastewater data include information that, when combined with case data, can be used to estimate the time-varying relative case ascertainment rate.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn order to make informed and timely public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. WBE provides a useful source of data that is not impacted by time-varying testing practices. Wastewater data can be quantitatively combined with case information to better understand the state of an epidemic. In order to determine the absolute case ascertainment rate (rather than the relative rate calculated in this work), there is a need for infection prevalence surveys to calibrate model results against.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEvidence on the long-term employment consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking. We used data from a large, community-based sample in the UK to estimate associations between Long Covid and subsequent employment outcomes.

MethodsThis was an observational, longitudinal study using a pre-post design. We included survey participants from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2022 when they were aged 16 to 64 years and not in full-time education. Using conditional logit modelling, we explored the time-varying relationship between Long Covid status [&amp;ge;]12 weeks after a first test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (reference: pre-infection) and labour market inactivity (neither working nor looking for work) or workplace absence lasting [&amp;ge;]4 weeks.

ResultsOf 206,299 included participants (mean age 45 years, 54% female, 92% white), 15% were ever inactive in the labour market and 10% were ever long-term absent during follow-up. Compared with pre-infection, inactivity was higher in participants reporting Long Covid 30 to &lt;40 weeks (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.45; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.81) or 40 to &lt;52 weeks (1.34; 1.05 to 1.72) post-infection. Combining with official statistics on Long Covid prevalence, our estimates translate to 27,000 (95% CI: 6,000 to 47,000) working-age adults in the UK being inactive because of Long Covid in July 2022.

ConclusionsLong Covid is likely to have contributed to reduced levels of participation in the UK labour market, though it is unlikely to be the sole driver. Further research is required to quantify the contribution of other factors, such as indirect health effects of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIrregular sleep-wake timing may cause circadian disruption leading to several chronic age-related diseases. We examined the relationship between sleep regularity and risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in 88,975 participants from the prospective UK Biobank cohort.

MethodsThe sleep regularity index (SRI) was calculated as the probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep or awake) at any two time points 24 hours apart, averaged over 7-days of accelerometry (range 0-100, with 100 being perfectly regular). The SRI was related to the risk of mortality in time-to-event models.

FindingsThe mean sample age was 62 years (SD, 8), 56% were women, and the median SRI was 60 (SD, 10). There were 3010 deaths during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years. Following adjustments for demographic and clinical variables, we identified a non-linear relationship between the SRI and all-cause mortality hazard (p [global test of spline term] &lt; 0{middle dot}001). Hazard Ratios, relative to the median SRI, were 1{middle dot}53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1{middle dot}41, 1{middle dot}66) for participants with SRI at the 5th percentile (SRI = 41) and 0{middle dot}90 (95% CI: 0{middle dot}81, 1{middle dot}00) for those with SRI at the 95th percentile (SRI = 75), respectively. Findings for CVD mortality and cancer mortality followed a similar pattern.

ConclusionsIrregular sleep-wake patterns are associated with higher mortality risk.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned from a pandemic to endemic disease, the majority of new infections have been among previously infected individuals. To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections.

MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups.

ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic.

ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes?

FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections.

MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an established technique in epidemiological investigation, using the principle of random allocation of genetic variants at conception to generate predicted causal effects of an exposure on an outcome. Extensions to this technique include non-linear approaches, that allow for differential effects of the exposure on the outcome depending on the level of the exposure. One popular method is the residual approach, which allows for stratification of the exposure via the level of the exposure and generation of causal estimates within each stratum. These &#34;local&#34; causal estimates are then used to make inferences about non-linear associations. Recent work has identified that under certain situations this method can lead to estimates that are seriously biased, and a new method - the doubly-ranked method - has been introduced as a possibly more robust approach. In this paper, we perform an analysis using negative control outcomes using both methods and find biased estimates in certain situations. We suggest caution in use of these methods and, if used, the performance of a number of sanity checks such as negative control outcomes in their reporting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) circulated cryptically before being identified as a threat, delaying interventions. Understanding the drivers of such silent spread and its epidemic impact is critical to inform future response planning. Here, we integrated spatio-temporal records of international mobility, local epidemic growth and genomic surveillance into a Bayesian framework to reconstruct the early dissemination of Alpha out of the UK in the first three months after emergence. We found that silent circulation lasted from days to months and was logarithmically associated with sequencing coverage. Social restrictions in certain countries likely slowed down the seeding of local transmission by weeks, mitigating the negative consequences of late detection. Revisiting the initial spread of Alpha supports local mitigation at the destination in case of emerging events.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence is increased after diagnosis of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear.

MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type.

FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19.

InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea.

Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population.

Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained.

No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia.

Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable.

We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.</p>
