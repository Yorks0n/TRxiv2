A.; Anderson, S. A.\nScore: 1098.5, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nAssociation between common adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands\nAuthors: Holwerda, M. R.; Hoeve, C. E.; Huiberts, A. J.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.; van den Hof, S.; Knol, M.\nScore: 171.1, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297194\nINTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations. METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination. RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (\u003c60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54). CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.\nAssessing the causal effect of air pollution on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Navaratnam, A. M. D.; Beale, S.; Boukari, Y.; Nguyen, V.; Fong, W. L. E.; Braithwaite, I.; Byrne, T. E.; Fragaszy, E.; Geismar, C.; Kovar, J.; Patel, P.; Shrotri, M.; Yavlinsky, A.; Hayward, A.; Khreis, H.; Aldridge, R. W.\nScore: 27.1, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297598\nIntroductionEmerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations. MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects. ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data. ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.\nA methylome-wide association study of major depression with out-of-sample case-control classification and trans-ancestry comparison\nAuthors: Shen, X.; Barbu, M.; Caramaschi, D.; Arathimos, R.; Czamara, D.; David, F.; Dearman, A.; Dilkes, E.; Herrera Rivero, M.; Huider, F.; Kühn, L.; Lu, K.-C.; Palviainen, T.; Schowe, A.

J.; Gadd, D. A.; Greimel, E.; Hannon, E.; Harris, S.; Homuth, G.; Howard, D.; Iurato, S.; Korhonen, T.; Lu, T.-P.; Martin, N.; Martins, J.; McDermott, E.; Meinert, S.; Navarro, P.; Ollikainen, M.; Pehl, V.; Piechaczek, C.; Scher\nScore: 17.7, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297630\nMajor Depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p \u003c 6.42e-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis (beta = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta (beta=-0.154, p=1.5e-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Wald's ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7e-3 to 4.58e-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.\nWastewater Tiling Amplicon Sequencing Reveals Longitudinal Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Prevalence in the Community\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Ni, G.; Tian, W.; Wang, H.; Li, J.; Thai, P.; Choi, P. M.; Jackson, G.; Hu, S.; Yang, B.; Guo, J.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297759\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, while the decline in clinical sequencing efforts hampers public health sectors to prepare for the menace of ongoing variant emergence and future COVID-19 surges. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed to provide complementary insights on the variants being transmitted in communities. However, limited research has been dedicated to the use sequencing methods for tracking disease prevalence and variant dynamics in wastewater, particularly on a large scale. Here, we employed tiling amplicon sequencing to track the dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from Queensland, Australia from 2020 to 2022. RNA concentrations in wastewater measured by ATOPlex showed a stronger correlation and greater consistency with the number of daily new cases than a PCR-based method. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater were largely in line with clinical reports. These findings support that WBE and sensitive sequencing methods can serve as a long-term approach for disease surveillance, thus aiding in disease outbreak prevention, control, and management.\nEstimated transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants from wastewater are robust to differential shedding\nAuthors: Dreifuss, D.; Huisman, J. S.; Rusch, J. C.; Caduff, L.; Ganesanandamoorthy, P.; Devaux, A. J.; Gan, C.; Stadler, T.; Kohn, T.; Ort, C.; Beerenwinkel, N.; Julian, T. R.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297539\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater samples can provide genomic information for detecting and assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in communities and for estimating important epidemiological parameters such as the growth advantage of the variant. However, despite demonstrated successes, epidemiological data derived from wastewater suffers from potential biases. Of particular concern are differential shedding profiles that different variants of concern exhibit, because they can shift the relationship between viral loads in wastewater and prevalence estimates derived from clinical cases. Using mathematical modeling, simulations, and Swiss surveillance data, we demonstrate that this bias does not affect estimation of the growth advantage of the variant and has only a limited and transient impact on estimates of the effective reproduction number. Thus, population-level epidemiological parameters derived from wastewater maintain their advantages over traditional clinical-derived estimates, even in the presence of differential shedding among variants.\nUnderstanding COVID-19 testing behaviour in England through a sociodemographic lens\nAuthors: Bajaj, S.; Chen, S.; Creswell, R.; Naidoo, R.; L.-H. Tsui, J.; Kolade, O.; Nicholson, G.; Lehmann, B.; A. Hay, J.; U.G. Kraemer, M.; Aguas, R.; A. Donnelly, C.; Fowler, T.; Hopkins, S.; Cantrell, L.; Dahal, P.; J. White, L.; Stepniewska, K.; Voysey, M.; Lambert, B.; EY-Oxford Health Analytics Consortium, Score: 6.2, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297608\nBackground Understanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour can help to protect the vulnerable and guide equity-driven interventions. Using COVID-19 testing data for England and data from community prevalence surveillance surveys (REACT-1 and ONS-CIS) from October 2020 to March 2022, we investigated the relationship between sociodemographic factors and testing behaviours in England. Methods We used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for 290 million tests performed and reported) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (data for 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public, provided by date, self-reported age and ethnicity at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level.Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. Using confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability by PCR by sociodemographic groups, We also estimated the daily incidence allowing us to determine the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme. Findings From March 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per-capita than those in the least deprived areas (Median ratio [Inter quartile range, IQR]: 0.50 [0.44, 0.54]). During October 2020 - June 2021, PCR testing patterns were in the opposite direction (Median ratio [IQR]: 1.8 [1.7, 1.9]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British communities were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the Alpha and Omicron BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England COVID-19 testing program detected 26% - 40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups. PCR testing biases were generally higher than for LFDs, which was in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. During the invasion phases of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern, the PCR testing bias in the most deprived populations was roughly double (ratio: 2.2 and 2.7 respectively) that in the least. We also determined that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that there was possibly a longer delay in reporting a positive LFD test in the Black populations. Interpretation Differences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups may be reflective of the relatively higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, digital literacy, and differing perception about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. Our work shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions at fine scale levels and by sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics.

No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p\u003c0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p\u003c0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p \u003c0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p \u003c0.001). Conclusion: The influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites\nDid long COVID increase road deaths in the U.S.?\nAuthors: Robertson, L. S.\nScore: 359.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296868\nObjectiveTo examine data on COVID-19 disease associated with a 10 percent increase in U.S. road deaths from 2020 to 2021 that raises the question of the potential effect of pandemic stress and neurological damage from COVID-19 disease. MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020. ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices. ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with \"long COVID\" to minimize road use. What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations. What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with \"long covid\" about road risk is warranted.\nAn algorithm to build synthetic temporal contact networks based on close-proximity interactions data\nAuthors: Duval, A.; Leclerc, Q. J.; Guillemot, D.; Temime, L.; Opatowski, L.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23296945\nSmall populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. The increased availability of empirical individual contact data provides unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity. However, these detailed data are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in health care settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recoding bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. The algorithm successfully reconstructed unobserved contacts, and was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The daily degree (10.8-14.7 vs 14.7-18.0), density (0.07-0.08 vs 0.08-0.10) and global efficiency (0.39-0.43; 0.46-0.49) were slightly overestimated. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other settings using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations.

METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination.

RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (&lt;60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54).

CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations.

MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects.

ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data.

ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Major Depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p &lt; 6.42e-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis (beta = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta (beta=-0.154, p=1.5e-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Wald&#39;s ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7e-3 to 4.58e-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, while the decline in clinical sequencing efforts hampers public health sectors to prepare for the menace of ongoing variant emergence and future COVID-19 surges. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed to provide complementary insights on the variants being transmitted in communities. However, limited research has been dedicated to the use sequencing methods for tracking disease prevalence and variant dynamics in wastewater, particularly on a large scale. Here, we employed tiling amplicon sequencing to track the dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from Queensland, Australia from 2020 to 2022. RNA concentrations in wastewater measured by ATOPlex showed a stronger correlation and greater consistency with the number of daily new cases than a PCR-based method. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater were largely in line with clinical reports. These findings support that WBE and sensitive sequencing methods can serve as a long-term approach for disease surveillance, thus aiding in disease outbreak prevention, control, and management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater samples can provide genomic information for detecting and assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in communities and for estimating important epidemiological parameters such as the growth advantage of the variant. However, despite demonstrated successes, epidemiological data derived from wastewater suffers from potential biases. Of particular concern are differential shedding profiles that different variants of concern exhibit, because they can shift the relationship between viral loads in wastewater and prevalence estimates derived from clinical cases. Using mathematical modeling, simulations, and Swiss surveillance data, we demonstrate that this bias does not affect estimation of the growth advantage of the variant and has only a limited and transient impact on estimates of the effective reproduction number. Thus, population-level epidemiological parameters derived from wastewater maintain their advantages over traditional clinical-derived estimates, even in the presence of differential shedding among variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Understanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour can help to protect the vulnerable and guide equity-driven interventions. Using COVID-19 testing data for England and data from community prevalence surveillance surveys (REACT-1 and ONS-CIS) from October 2020 to March 2022, we investigated the relationship between sociodemographic factors and testing behaviours in England. Methods We used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for 290 million tests performed and reported) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (data for 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public, provided by date, self-reported age and ethnicity at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level.Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. Using confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability by PCR by sociodemographic groups, We also estimated the daily incidence allowing us to determine the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme. Findings From March 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per-capita than those in the least deprived areas (Median ratio [Inter quartile range, IQR]: 0.50 [0.44, 0.54]). During October 2020 - June 2021, PCR testing patterns were in the opposite direction (Median ratio [IQR]: 1.8 [1.7, 1.9]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British communities were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the Alpha and Omicron BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England COVID-19 testing program detected 26% - 40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups. PCR testing biases were generally higher than for LFDs, which was in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. During the invasion phases of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern, the PCR testing bias in the most deprived populations was roughly double (ratio: 2.2 and 2.7 respectively) that in the least. We also determined that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that there was possibly a longer delay in reporting a positive LFD test in the Black populations. Interpretation Differences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups may be reflective of the relatively higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, digital literacy, and differing perception about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. Our work shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions at fine scale levels and by sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics. Funding UK Health Security Agency.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Some studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospital- ization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p&lt;0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p&lt;0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p &lt;0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p &lt;0.001). Conclusion: The influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine data on COVID-19 disease associated with a 10 percent increase in U.S. road deaths from 2020 to 2021 that raises the question of the potential effect of pandemic stress and neurological damage from COVID-19 disease.

MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020.

ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices.

ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with &#34;long COVID&#34; to minimize road use.

What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations.

What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with &#34;long covid&#34; about road risk is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. The increased availability of empirical individual contact data provides unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity. However, these detailed data are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in health care settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF).

Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recoding bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks.

The algorithm successfully reconstructed unobserved contacts, and was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The daily degree (10.8-14.7 vs 14.7-18.0), density (0.07-0.08 vs 0.08-0.10) and global efficiency (0.39-0.43; 0.46-0.49) were slightly overestimated.

To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other settings using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.</p>
