A.\nScore: 38.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299602\nBackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19. OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

D.; Butler-Cole, B. F.; Tazare, J.; Tomlinson, L. A.; Marks, M.; Jit, M.; Briggs, A.; Lin, L.-Y.; Carlile, O.; Bates, C.; Parry, J.; Bacon, S. C.; Dillingham, I.; Dennison, W. A.; Costello, R. E.; Wei, Y.; Walker, A. J.; Hulme, W.; Goldacre, B.; Mehrkar, A.; MacKenna, B.; Collaborative, T. O.; Herrett, E.; Eggo, R. M.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299364\nBackgroundLong COVID is the patient-coined term for the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 illness for weeks, months or years following the acute infection. There is a large burden of long COVID globally from self-reported data, but the epidemiology, causes and treatments remain poorly understood. Primary care is used to help identify and treat patients with long COVID and therefore Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of past COVID-19 patients could be used to help fill these knowledge gaps. We aimed to describe those with long COVID in primary care records in England. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England we used routine clinical data from over 19 million adults in England linked to SARS-COV-2 test result, hospitalisation and vaccination data to describe trends in the recording of 16 clinical codes related to long COVID between November 2020 and January 2023. We calculated rates per 100,000 person-years and plotted how these changed over time. We compared crude and minimally adjusted rates of recorded long COVID in patient records between different key demographic and vaccination characteristics using negative binomial models. FindingsWe identified a total of 55,465 people recorded to have long COVID over the study period, with incidence of new long COVID records increasing steadily over 2021, and declining over 2022. The overall rate per 100,000 person-years was 177.5 cases in women (95% CI: 175.5-179) and 100.5 men (99.5-102). In terms of vaccination against COVID-19, the lowest rates were observed in those with 3+ vaccine doses (103.5 [95% CI: 101.5-105]). Finally, the majority of those with a long COVID record did not have a recorded positive SARS-COV-2 test 12 weeks before the long COVID record. InterpretationEHR recorded long COVID remains very low compared and incident records of long COVID declined over 2022. We found the lowest rates of recorded long COVID in people with 3 or more vaccine doses. We summarised several sources of possible bias for researchers using EHRs to study long COVID.\nSpatial and Temporal Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in uMgungundlovu, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa\nAuthors: Gangat, R.; Ngah, V.; Blanford, J.; Tawonga, R.; Ncayiyana, J. R.; Nyasulu, P. S.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.23299736\nBackgroundInvestigating the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 at a local level and describing the pattern of disease occurrence can be used as the basis for efficient prevention and control measures. This research project aims to utilize geospatial analysis to understand the distribution patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with certain co-existing factors. MethodsSpatial characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated over the first four waves of transmission using ESRI ArcGISPro v2.0, including Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) with Morans \"I\" as the measure of spatial autocorrelation; and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). In implementing temporal analysis, time series analysis using the Python Seaborn library was used, with separate modelling carried out for each wave. ResultsStatistically significant SARS-CoV-2 incidences were noted across age groups with p-values consistently \u003c 0.001. The central region of the district experienced a higher level of clusters indicated by the LISA (Morans I: wave 1 - 0.22, wave 2 - 0.2, wave 3 - 0.11, wave 4 - 0.13) and the KDE (Highest density of cases: wave 1: 25.1-50, wave 2: 101-150, wave 3: 101-150, wave 4: 50.1-100). Temporal analysis showed more fluctuation at the beginning of each wave with less fluctuation in identified cases within the middle to end of each wave. ConclusionA Geospatial approach of analysing infectious disease transmission is proposed to guide control efforts (e.g., testing/tracing and vaccine rollout) for populations at higher vulnerability. Additionally, the nature and configuration of the social and built environment may be associated with increased transmission. However, locally specific empirical research is required to assess other relevant factors associated with increased transmission.\nA Data Science Pipeline Applied to Australia's 2022 COVID-19 Omicron Waves\nAuthors: Trauer, J. M.; Hughes, A. E.; Shipman, D. S.; Meehan, M. T.; Henderson, A. S.; McBryde, E. S.; Ragonnet, R.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299260\nThe field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed, with packages now available to support many stages of data science pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated this with several open-source libraries and applied this pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australias 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, but including the effect of 2022 vaccination programs on transmission did not. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30 to 60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online notebooks.\nSex differences in the secular change in waist circumference relative to body mass index in the Americas and England from 1997 to 2020\nAuthors: Sanchez-Romero, L. M.; Sagaceta-Mejia, J.; Mindell, J. S.; Passi-Solar, A.; Bernabe-Ortiz, A.; Tolentino-Mayo, L.; Moody, A.; Scholes, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.10.23299756\nObjective: To quantify changes over time in waist circumference (WC) relative to body mass index (BMI) by sex in the Americas (United States of America, Mexico, Chile, Peru) and England. Methods: Data from adults aged 25-64 years between 1997 and 2020 was analysed; US data was stratified by racial-ethnic groups. Sex-specific BMI and WC means, and obesity and abdominal obesity prevalence, were compared between the first and last surveys. Using data from all survey years, secular changes across the BMI and WC distributions were estimated applying quantile regression models. BMI was added as a predictor of WC to estimate secular changes in WC relative to BMI. Interaction terms were included in all models to evaluate differences by sex. Results: BMI and WC (except Peru) showed larger secular increases at the upper-tails of the distributions in both sexes. Increases at the 50th and 75th WC centiles relative to BMI were more pronounced in women than in men, with larger increases in US non-Hispanic whites and in England. In men, increases in WC independently of BMI were most evident in Mexico. Conclusions: Disease risk associated with visceral fat, is potentially underestimated by national surveillance efforts that quantify secular changes only in BMI.\nImmunity to non-dengue flaviviruses impacts dengue virus IgG ELISA specificity in Cambodia\nAuthors: Odio, C.; Yek, C.; Hasund, C.; Man, S.; Ly, P.; Nhek, S.; Chea, S.; Lon, C.; Voirin, C.; Huy, R.; Leang, R.; Huch, C.; Oliveira, F.; Manning, J.; Katzelnick, L.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298701\nSeroprevalence studies are the gold standard for disease surveillance, and serology was used to determine eligibility for the first licensed dengue vaccine. However, expanding flavivirus endemicity, co-circulation, and vaccination complicate serology results. Among 713 healthy Cambodian children, a commonly used indirect dengue virus IgG ELISA (PanBio) had a lower specificity than previously reported (94% vs. 100%). Of those with false positive PanBio results, 46% had detectable neutralizing antibodies against other flaviviruses, with the highest frequency against West Nile virus (WNV). Immunity to non-dengue flaviviruses can impact dengue surveillance and potentially pre-vaccine screening efforts.\n",

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a  pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and  vaccinated and  unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19.

OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19.

InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID is the patient-coined term for the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 illness for weeks, months or years following the acute infection. There is a large burden of long COVID globally from self-reported data, but the epidemiology, causes and treatments remain poorly understood. Primary care is used to help identify and treat patients with long COVID and therefore Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of past COVID-19 patients could be used to help fill these knowledge gaps. We aimed to describe those with long COVID in primary care records in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England we used routine clinical data from over 19 million adults in England linked to SARS-COV-2 test result, hospitalisation and vaccination data to describe trends in the recording of 16 clinical codes related to long COVID between November 2020 and January 2023. We calculated rates per 100,000 person-years and plotted how these changed over time. We compared crude and minimally adjusted rates of recorded long COVID in patient records between different key demographic and vaccination characteristics using negative binomial models.

FindingsWe identified a total of 55,465 people recorded to have long COVID over the study period, with incidence of new long COVID records increasing steadily over 2021, and declining over 2022. The overall rate per 100,000 person-years was 177.5 cases in women (95% CI: 175.5-179) and 100.5 men (99.5-102). In terms of vaccination against COVID-19, the lowest rates were observed in those with 3&#43; vaccine doses (103.5 [95% CI: 101.5-105]). Finally, the majority of those with a long COVID record did not have a recorded positive SARS-COV-2 test 12 weeks before the long COVID record.

InterpretationEHR recorded long COVID remains very low compared and incident records of long COVID declined over 2022. We found the lowest rates of recorded long COVID in people with 3 or more vaccine doses. We summarised several sources of possible bias for researchers using EHRs to study long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInvestigating the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2 at a local level and describing the pattern of disease occurrence can be used as the basis for efficient prevention and control measures. This research project aims to utilize geospatial analysis to understand the distribution patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with certain co-existing factors.

MethodsSpatial characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated over the first four waves of transmission using ESRI ArcGISPro v2.0, including Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) with Morans &#34;I&#34; as the measure of spatial autocorrelation; and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). In implementing temporal analysis, time series analysis using the Python Seaborn library was used, with separate modelling carried out for each wave.

ResultsStatistically significant SARS-CoV-2 incidences were noted across age groups with p-values consistently &lt; 0.001. The central region of the district experienced a higher level of clusters indicated by the LISA (Morans I: wave 1 - 0.22, wave 2 - 0.2, wave 3 - 0.11, wave 4 - 0.13) and the KDE (Highest density of cases: wave 1: 25.1-50, wave 2: 101-150, wave 3: 101-150, wave 4: 50.1-100). Temporal analysis showed more fluctuation at the beginning of each wave with less fluctuation in identified cases within the middle to end of each wave.

ConclusionA Geospatial approach of analysing infectious disease transmission is proposed to guide control efforts (e.g., testing/tracing and vaccine rollout) for populations at higher vulnerability. Additionally, the nature and configuration of the social and built environment may be associated with increased transmission. However, locally specific empirical research is required to assess other relevant factors associated with increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed, with packages now available to support many stages of data science pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated this with several open-source libraries and applied this pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australias 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, but including the effect of 2022 vaccination programs on transmission did not. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30 to 60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online notebooks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: To quantify changes over time in waist circumference (WC) relative to body mass index (BMI) by sex in the Americas (United States of America, Mexico, Chile, Peru) and England. Methods: Data from adults aged 25-64 years between 1997 and 2020 was analysed; US data was stratified by racial-ethnic groups. Sex-specific BMI and WC means, and obesity and abdominal obesity prevalence, were compared between the first and last surveys. Using data from all survey years, secular changes across the BMI and WC distributions were estimated applying quantile regression models. BMI was added as a predictor of WC to estimate secular changes in WC relative to BMI. Interaction terms were included in all models to evaluate differences by sex. Results: BMI and WC (except Peru) showed larger secular increases at the upper-tails of the distributions in both sexes. Increases at the 50th and 75th WC centiles relative to BMI were more pronounced in women than in men, with larger increases in US non-Hispanic whites and in England. In men, increases in WC independently of BMI were most evident in Mexico. Conclusions: Disease risk associated with visceral fat, is potentially underestimated by national surveillance efforts that quantify secular changes only in BMI.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Seroprevalence studies are the gold standard for disease surveillance, and serology was used to determine eligibility for the first licensed dengue vaccine. However, expanding flavivirus endemicity, co-circulation, and vaccination complicate serology results. Among 713 healthy Cambodian children, a commonly used indirect dengue virus IgG ELISA (PanBio) had a lower specificity than previously reported (94% vs. 100%). Of those with false positive PanBio results, 46% had detectable neutralizing antibodies against other flaviviruses, with the highest frequency against West Nile virus (WNV). Immunity to non-dengue flaviviruses can impact dengue surveillance and potentially pre-vaccine screening efforts.</p>
