The objective of this study was to analyze and report the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Tucuman, Argentina during the second and third surges of COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022. The study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, correlating it with clinically reported COVID-19 cases. Wastewater samples (n=72) were collected from 16 sampling points located in 3 cities of Tucuman (San Miguel de Tucuman, Yerba Buena and Banda del Rio Sali). Detection of viral nucleocapsid markers (N1 gene) was carried out using one-step RT-qPCR. Viral loads were determined for each positive sample using a standard curve. A positive correlation (p\u003c0.05) was observed between viral load (copies/mL) and the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during the sampling period in San Miguel de Tucuman. Our findings allowed us to monitor the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 infection during epidemic outbreaks. Wastewater monitoring is a valuable epidemiological indicator that enables the anticipation of increases in COVID-19 cases and tracking the progress of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based surveillance should be implemented as a routine practice to prepare for any future surge in infections.\nCombining genomic data and infection estimates to characterize the complex dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States\nAuthors: Lopes, R.; Pham, K.; Klaassen, F.; Chitwood, M. H.; Hahn, A.; Redmond, S.; Swartwood, N. A.; Salomon, J. A.; Menzies, N. A.; Cohen, T.; Grubaugh, N. D.\nScore: 185.3, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298178\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nTemporal contact patterns and the implications for predicting superspreaders and planning of targeted outbreak control\nAuthors: Pung, R.; Firth, J. A.; Russell, T.; Rogers, T.; Lee, V. J.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298919\nEpidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions. SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.\nNationwide SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Trends in the Netherlands in the Variant of Concern Era, 2021-2022: an Ongoing Prospective Cohort Study\nAuthors: Vos, E. R. A.; van Hagen, C. C. E.; Wong, D.; Smits, G.; Kuijer, M.; Wijmenga-Monsuur, A. J.; Kaczorowska, J.; van Binnendijk, R. S.; van der Klis, F. R. M.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298889\nBackgroundRepeated population-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance is key in complementing other surveillance tools. AimAssessing trends in infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity, including breakthrough infections, among (sub)groups and regions in the Dutch population during the Variant of Concern (VOC)-era whilst varying levels of stringency, to evaluate population immunity dynamics and inform future pandemic response planning. MethodsIn this prospective population-based cohort, randomly-selected participants (n=9,985) aged 1-92 years (recruited since early-2020) donated home-collected fingerstick blood samples at six timepoints in 2021-2022, covering waves dominated by Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). IgG antibody assessments against Spike-S1 and Nucleoprotein were combined with vaccination- and testing data to estimate infection-induced (inf) and total (infection- and vaccination-induced) seroprevalence. ResultsIn 2021, nationwide inf-seroprevalence rose modestly from 12% since Alpha to 26% amidst Delta, while total seroprevalence increased rapidly to nearly 90%, particularly fast in vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly and those with comorbidities). Highest infection rates were noticeable in adolescents and young adults, low/middle educated elderly, non-Western, contact professions (other than healthcare), and low-vaccination coverage regions. In 2022, following Omicron emergence, inf-seroprevalence elevated sharply to 62% and further to 86%, with frequent breakthrough infections and reduction of seroprevalence dissimilarities between most groups. Whereas \u003e90% of \u003c60-year-olds had been infected, 30% of vaccinated vulnerable individuals had not acquired hybrid immunity. ConclusionAlthough total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence had increased rapidly, infection rates were unequally distributed within the Dutch population. Ongoing tailored vaccination efforts and (sero-)monitoring of vulnerable groups remain important given their lowest rate of hybrid immunity and highest susceptibility to severe disease.\nMuscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities is associated with multimorbidity burden in older adults: the Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA)\nAuthors: Mau, T.; Blackwell, T. L.; Cawthon, P. M.; Molina, A. J. A.; Coen, P. M.; Distefano, G.; Kramer, P. A.; Ramos, S. V.; Forman, D. E.; Goodpaster, B. H.; Toledo, F. G. S.; Duchowny, K. A.; Sparks, L. M.; Newman, A. B.; Kritchevsky, S. B.; Cummings, S. R.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298175\nBackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity. MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3+ conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions. ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI+CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

Z.; Kunatharaju, S.; Golder, S.; Levine, L. D.; Figueiredo, J. C.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298696\nBackgroundPreterm birth, defined as birth at \u003c37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [\u0026ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36). ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21). ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.\nChatGPT for assessing risk of bias of randomized trials using the RoB 2.0 tool: A methods study\nAuthors: Pitre, T.; Jassal, T.; Talukdar, J. R.; Shahab, M.; Ling, M.; Zeraatkar, D.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.23298727\nBackgroundThe assessment of risk of bias is a critical component of systematic review methods. Assessing risk of bias, however, can be time- and resource-intensive. AI-based solutions may increase efficiency and reduce burden. ObjectiveTo evaluate the reliability of ChatGPT for performing risk of bias assessments of randomized trials. MethodsWe sampled recently published Cochrane systematic reviews of medical interventions (up to October 2023) that included randomized controlled trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane-endorsed revised risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). From each eligible review, we collected data on the risk of bias assessments for the first three reported outcomes. Using ChatGPT-4, we assessed the risk of bias for the same outcomes using three different prompts: a minimal prompt including limited instructions, a maximal prompt with extensive instructions, and an optimized prompt that was designed to yield the best risk of bias judgments. The agreement between ChatGPTs assessments and those of the systematic reviewers was quantified using weighted kappa statistics. ResultsWe included 34 systematic reviews with 157 unique trials. We found the agreement between ChatGPT and systematic review authors for assessment of overall risk of bias to be 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.3) for the maximal ChatGPT prompt, 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32) for the optimized prompt, and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.27) for the minimal prompt. For the optimized prompt, agreement ranged between 0.11 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.33) to 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.44) across risk of bias domains, with the lowest agreement for the deviations from the intended intervention domain and the highest agreement for the missing outcome data domain. ConclusionOur results suggest that ChatGPT and systematic reviewers only have \"slight\" to \"fair\" agreement in risk of bias judgments for randomized trials. ChatGPT is currently unable to reliably assess risk of bias of randomized trials. We recommend systematic reviewers avoid using ChatGPT to perform risk of bias assessments.\nCharacterizing US spatial connectivity: implications for geographical disease dynamics and metapopulation modeling\nAuthors: Pullano, G.; Alvarez-Zuzek, L. G.; Colizza, V.; Bansal, S.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298916\nBackgroundHuman mobility is expected to be a critical factor in the geographic diffusion of infectious diseases, and this assumption led to the implementation of social distancing policies during the early fight against the COVID-19 emergency in the United States. Yet, because of substantial data gaps in the past, what still eludes our understanding are the following questions: 1) How does mobility contribute to the spread of infection within the United States at local, regional, and national scales? 2) How do seasonality and shifts in behavior affect mobility over time? 3) At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States? Addressing these questions is critical to developing accurate transmission models, predicting the spatial propagation of disease across scales, and understanding the optimal geographical and temporal scale for the implementation of control policies. MethodsWe address this problem using high-resolution human mobility data measured via mobile app usage. We compute the daily coupling network between US counties, and we integrate our mobility data into a spatially explicit transmission model to reproduce the national invasion of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the US. FindingsTemporally, we observe that intercounty connectivity is largely seasonal and was unperturbed by mobility restrictions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially, we identify 104 geographic clusters of US counties that are highly connected by mobility within the cluster and more sparsely connected to counties outside the cluster. These clusters are stable across time and highly overlap with US state boundaries. Together, these results suggest that intercounty connectivity in the US is relatively static across time and is homogeneous at the sub-state level. We also find that while having access to county-level, daily mobility data best captures the spatial invasion of disease, static mobility data aggregated to the scale of our mobility data-based clusters also performs well in capturing spatial diffusion of infection. InterpretationOur work demonstrates that intercounty mobility was negligibly affected outside the lockdown period of Spring 2020, explaining the broad spatial distribution of COVID-19 outbreaks in the US during the early phase of the pandemic. Such geographically dispersed outbreaks place a significant strain on national public health resources and necessitate complex metapopulation modeling approaches for predicting disease dynamics and control design. We thus inform the design of such metapopulation models to balance high disease predictability with low data requirements.\nASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: RESULTS FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT\nAuthors: Sekendiz, Z.; Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Carr, M. A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1184.4, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nAssessing the Impact of Mask Mandates on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission: A Case Study of Utah\nAuthors: Horn, A. C.; Shoemaker, H. E.; Keegan, L. T.\nScore: 141.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298464\nBackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1. MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology provides temporal and spatial information about the health status of a population. The objective of this study was to analyze and report the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Tucuman, Argentina during the second and third surges of COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022. The study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, correlating it with clinically reported COVID-19 cases. Wastewater samples (n=72) were collected from 16 sampling points located in 3 cities of Tucuman (San Miguel de Tucuman, Yerba Buena and Banda del Rio Sali). Detection of viral nucleocapsid markers (N1 gene) was carried out using one-step RT-qPCR. Viral loads were determined for each positive sample using a standard curve. A positive correlation (p&lt;0.05) was observed between viral load (copies/mL) and the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during the sampling period in San Miguel de Tucuman. Our findings allowed us to monitor the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 infection during epidemic outbreaks. Wastewater monitoring is a valuable epidemiological indicator that enables the anticipation of increases in COVID-19 cases and tracking the progress of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based surveillance should be implemented as a routine practice to prepare for any future surge in infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

        <p class="abstract">Epidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions.

SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual  superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRepeated population-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance is key in complementing other surveillance tools.

AimAssessing trends in infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity, including breakthrough infections, among (sub)groups and regions in the Dutch population during the Variant of Concern (VOC)-era whilst varying levels of stringency, to evaluate population immunity dynamics and inform future pandemic response planning.

MethodsIn this prospective population-based cohort, randomly-selected participants (n=9,985) aged 1-92 years (recruited since early-2020) donated home-collected fingerstick blood samples at six timepoints in 2021-2022, covering waves dominated by Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). IgG antibody assessments against Spike-S1 and Nucleoprotein were combined with vaccination- and testing data to estimate infection-induced (inf) and total (infection- and vaccination-induced) seroprevalence.

ResultsIn 2021, nationwide inf-seroprevalence rose modestly from 12% since Alpha to 26% amidst Delta, while total seroprevalence increased rapidly to nearly 90%, particularly fast in vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly and those with comorbidities). Highest infection rates were noticeable in adolescents and young adults, low/middle educated elderly, non-Western, contact professions (other than healthcare), and low-vaccination coverage regions. In 2022, following Omicron emergence, inf-seroprevalence elevated sharply to 62% and further to 86%, with frequent breakthrough infections and reduction of seroprevalence dissimilarities between most groups. Whereas &gt;90% of &lt;60-year-olds had been infected, 30% of vaccinated vulnerable individuals had not acquired hybrid immunity.

ConclusionAlthough total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence had increased rapidly, infection rates were unequally distributed within the Dutch population. Ongoing tailored vaccination efforts and (sero-)monitoring of vulnerable groups remain important given their lowest rate of hybrid immunity and highest susceptibility to severe disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity.

MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3&#43; conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions.

ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI&#43;CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPreterm birth, defined as birth at &lt;37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&amp;ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).

ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21).

ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe assessment of risk of bias is a critical component of systematic review methods. Assessing risk of bias, however, can be time- and resource-intensive. AI-based solutions may increase efficiency and reduce burden.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the reliability of ChatGPT for performing risk of bias assessments of randomized trials.

MethodsWe sampled recently published Cochrane systematic reviews of medical interventions (up to October 2023) that included randomized controlled trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane-endorsed revised risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). From each eligible review, we collected data on the risk of bias assessments for the first three reported outcomes. Using ChatGPT-4, we assessed the risk of bias for the same outcomes using three different prompts: a minimal prompt including limited instructions, a maximal prompt with extensive instructions, and an optimized prompt that was designed to yield the best risk of bias judgments. The agreement between ChatGPTs assessments and those of the systematic reviewers was quantified using weighted kappa statistics.

ResultsWe included 34 systematic reviews with 157 unique trials. We found the agreement between ChatGPT and systematic review authors for assessment of overall risk of bias to be 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.3) for the maximal ChatGPT prompt, 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32) for the optimized prompt, and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.27) for the minimal prompt. For the optimized prompt, agreement ranged between 0.11 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.33) to 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.44) across risk of bias domains, with the lowest agreement for the deviations from the intended intervention domain and the highest agreement for the missing outcome data domain.

ConclusionOur results suggest that ChatGPT and systematic reviewers only have &#34;slight&#34; to &#34;fair&#34; agreement in risk of bias judgments for randomized trials. ChatGPT is currently unable to reliably assess risk of bias of randomized trials. We recommend systematic reviewers avoid using ChatGPT to perform risk of bias assessments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHuman mobility is expected to be a critical factor in the geographic diffusion of infectious diseases, and this assumption led to the implementation of social distancing policies during the early fight against the COVID-19 emergency in the United States. Yet, because of substantial data gaps in the past, what still eludes our understanding are the following questions: 1) How does mobility contribute to the spread of infection within the United States at local, regional, and national scales? 2) How do seasonality and shifts in behavior affect mobility over time? 3) At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States? Addressing these questions is critical to developing accurate transmission models, predicting the spatial propagation of disease across scales, and understanding the optimal geographical and temporal scale for the implementation of control policies.

MethodsWe address this problem using high-resolution human mobility data measured via mobile app usage. We compute the daily coupling network between US counties, and we integrate our mobility data into a spatially explicit transmission model to reproduce the national invasion of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.

FindingsTemporally, we observe that intercounty connectivity is largely seasonal and was unperturbed by mobility restrictions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially, we identify 104 geographic clusters of US counties that are highly connected by mobility within the cluster and more sparsely connected to counties outside the cluster. These clusters are stable across time and highly overlap with US state boundaries. Together, these results suggest that intercounty connectivity in the US is relatively static across time and is homogeneous at the sub-state level. We also find that while having access to county-level, daily mobility data best captures the spatial invasion of disease, static mobility data aggregated to the scale of our mobility data-based clusters also performs well in capturing spatial diffusion of infection.

InterpretationOur work demonstrates that intercounty mobility was negligibly affected outside the lockdown period of Spring 2020, explaining the broad spatial distribution of COVID-19 outbreaks in the US during the early phase of the pandemic. Such geographically dispersed outbreaks place a significant strain on national public health resources and necessitate complex metapopulation modeling approaches for predicting disease dynamics and control design. We thus inform the design of such metapopulation models to balance high disease predictability with low data requirements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1.

MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.

ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.

ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.</p>
