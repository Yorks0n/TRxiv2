T.; Doohan, P.; Nash, R. K.; Hicks, J. T.; Charniga, K.; Geismar, C.; Lambert, B.; Nikitin, D.; Skarp, J. E.; Wardle, J.; Pathogen Epidemiology Review Group, ; Kont, M.; Bhatia, S.; Imai, N.; van Elsland, S. L.; Cori, A.; Morgenstern, C.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292424\nBackgroundRecent Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania highlighted the importance of better understanding this highly lethal infectious pathogen. Past epidemics of Ebola, COVID-19, and other pathogens have re-emphasised the usefulness of mathematical models in guiding public health responses during outbreaks. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023393345) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed papers reporting historical out-breaks, modelling studies and epidemiological parameters focused on MVD, including contextual information. We searched PubMed and Web of Science until 31st March 2023. Two reviewers evaluated all titles and abstracts, with consensus-based decision-making. To ensure agreement, 31% (13/42) of studies were double-extracted and a custom-designed quality assessment questionnaire was used to assess the risk of bias. FindingsWe present detailed outbreak, model and parameter information on 970 reported cases and 818 deaths from MVD until 31 March 2023. Analysis of historical outbreaks and sero-prevalence estimates suggests the possibility of undetected MVD outbreaks, asymptomatic transmission and/or cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates. InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available. FundingMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown. C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary. C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

M.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292588\nWe propose TetraHer, a method for estimating the liability heritability of binary phenotypes. TetraHer has five key features. Firstly, it can be applied to data from complex pedigrees, that contain multiple types of relationships. Secondly, it can correct for ascertainment of cases or controls. Thirdly, it can accommodate covariates. Fourthly, it can model the contribution of common environment. Fifthly, it produces a likelihood, that can be used for significance testing. We first demonstrate the validity of TetraHer on simulated data. We then use TetraHer to estimate liability heritability for 229 codes from the tenth International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We identify 118 codes with significant heritability (P\u003c0.05/229), which can be used in future analyses for investigating the genetic architecture of human diseases.\nSimultaneous detection and quantification of multiple enteric pathogen targets in wastewater\nAuthors: Rao, G.; Capone, D.; Zhu, K.; Knoble, A.; Linden, Y.; Clark, R.; Lai, A.; Kim, J.; Huang, C.-H.; Bivins, A.; Brown, J.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291792\nWastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a critical tool for public health surveillance, building on decades of environmental surveillance work for pathogens such as poliovirus. Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.\nComparative Reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in three African countries using a mathematical model integrating immunity data.\nAuthors: neffeti, b.; kebir, a.; ben aribi, w.; Diarra, M.; schoenhals, m.; vigan-womas, i.; dellagi, k.; ben miled, s.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292215\nObjectivesAfrica has experienced fewer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths than other regions, with a contrasting epidemiological situation between countries, raising questions regarding the determinants of disease spread in Africa. MethodWe built a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model including COVID-19 mortality data where recovery class is structured by specific immunization and modeled by a partial differential equation considering the opposed effects of immunity decline and immunization. This model was applied to Tunisia, Senegal, and Madagascar. FindingSenegal and Tunisia experienced two epidemic phases. Initially, infections emerged in naive individuals and were limited by social distancing. Variants of concern (VOCs) were also introduced. The second phase was characterized by successive epidemic waves driven by new VOCs that escaped host immunity. Meanwhile, Madagascar demonstrated a different profile, characterized by longer intervals between epidemic waves, increasing the pool of susceptible individuals who had lost their protective immunity. The impact of vaccination in Tunisia and Senegal on model parameters was evaluated. InterpretationLoss of immunity and vaccination-induced immunity have played crucial role in controlling the African pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become endemic now and will continue to circulate in African populations. However, previous infections provide significant protection against severe diseases, thus providing a basis for future vaccination strategies.\nAssociation of Domains of Sedentary Behavior with Cardiovascular Disease Events in The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis\nAuthors: Mayo, N. L.; Lopez, D. A.; Block, R. C.; Shi, H.; Bertoni, A. G.; Diaz, K. M.; Ding, J.; Post, W. S.; Liu, Y.; Li, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291977\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. Little is known about this relationship in an ethnically diverse population. The objective of our study is to assess the effects of leisure time and occupational sedentary behavior on multiple cardiovascular outcomes in a multi-ethnic cohort. MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) includes 2619 Caucasian, 1495 Hispanic, 1891 Black, and 804 Chinese-American adults aged 45-84 years and free of clinical CVD at enrollment, Sedentary behavior was self-reported at baseline. Participants were followed for an average of 13.6 years, and 14 types of cardiovascular outcomes were ascertained. Hazards of each cardiovascular outcome were modeled with adjustment for potential confounders, including physical activity. ResultsEvery one hour per day increase in leisure time sedentary behavior predicts a 6% increase in the adjusted hazards for CVD death (P \u003c 0.05). Every one hour increase in occupational sedentary time predicts a 21% and 20% decrease in the hazard for PVD and other revascularization, respectively (P \u003c 0.05). ConclusionsLeisure time sedentary behavior was associated with increased hazards for CVD death, but occupational sedentary time appears to be protective of peripheral vascular disease and other revascularization. Condensed AbstractSedentary behavior has been consistently associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) consists of a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of adults age 45-84, free from CVD at baseline. Greater levels of leisure time sedentary behavior predicted increased hazards for PVD and CVD death after an average follow up of 13.6 years whereas occupational sedentary behaviors predicted reduced PVD. These results underscore the importance of reducing time spent sitting in addition to advocating for meeting physical activity targets across ethnicities.\n",

Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates.

InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available.

Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study
We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown.
C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study
We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary.
C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence
Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

        <p class="abstract">We propose TetraHer, a method for estimating the liability heritability of binary phenotypes. TetraHer has five key features. Firstly, it can be applied to data from complex pedigrees, that contain multiple types of relationships. Secondly, it can correct for ascertainment of cases or controls. Thirdly, it can accommodate covariates. Fourthly, it can model the contribution of common environment. Fifthly, it produces a likelihood, that can be used for significance testing. We first demonstrate the validity of TetraHer on simulated data. We then use TetraHer to estimate liability heritability for 229 codes from the tenth International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We identify 118 codes with significant heritability (P&lt;0.05/229), which can be used in future analyses for investigating the genetic architecture of human diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a critical tool for public health surveillance, building on decades of environmental surveillance work for pathogens such as poliovirus. Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesAfrica has experienced fewer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths than other regions, with a contrasting epidemiological situation between countries, raising questions regarding the determinants of disease spread in Africa.

MethodWe built a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model including COVID-19 mortality data where recovery class is structured by specific immunization and modeled by a partial differential equation considering the opposed effects of immunity decline and immunization. This model was applied to Tunisia, Senegal, and Madagascar.

FindingSenegal and Tunisia experienced two epidemic phases. Initially, infections emerged in naive individuals and were limited by social distancing. Variants of concern (VOCs) were also introduced. The second phase was characterized by successive epidemic waves driven by new VOCs that escaped host immunity. Meanwhile, Madagascar demonstrated a different profile, characterized by longer intervals between epidemic waves, increasing the pool of susceptible individuals who had lost their protective immunity. The impact of vaccination in Tunisia and Senegal on model parameters was evaluated.

InterpretationLoss of immunity and vaccination-induced immunity have played crucial role in controlling the African pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become endemic now and will continue to circulate in African populations. However, previous infections provide significant protection against severe diseases, thus providing a basis for future vaccination strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. Little is known about this relationship in an ethnically diverse population. The objective of our study is to assess the effects of leisure time and occupational sedentary behavior on multiple cardiovascular outcomes in a multi-ethnic cohort.

MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) includes 2619 Caucasian, 1495 Hispanic, 1891 Black, and 804 Chinese-American adults aged 45-84 years and free of clinical CVD at enrollment, Sedentary behavior was self-reported at baseline. Participants were followed for an average of 13.6 years, and 14 types of cardiovascular outcomes were ascertained. Hazards of each cardiovascular outcome were modeled with adjustment for potential confounders, including physical activity.

ResultsEvery one hour per day increase in leisure time sedentary behavior predicts a 6% increase in the adjusted hazards for CVD death (P &lt; 0.05). Every one hour increase in occupational sedentary time predicts a 21% and 20% decrease in the hazard for PVD and other revascularization, respectively (P &lt; 0.05).

ConclusionsLeisure time sedentary behavior was associated with increased hazards for CVD death, but occupational sedentary time appears to be protective of peripheral vascular disease and other revascularization.

Condensed AbstractSedentary behavior has been consistently associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) consists of a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of adults age 45-84, free from CVD at baseline. Greater levels of leisure time sedentary behavior predicted increased hazards for PVD and CVD death after an average follow up of 13.6 years whereas occupational sedentary behaviors predicted reduced PVD. These results underscore the importance of reducing time spent sitting in addition to advocating for meeting physical activity targets across ethnicities.</p>
