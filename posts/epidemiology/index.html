Whether measuring thousands of proteins offers predictive information across a wide range of diseases is unknown. MethodsIn 41,931 individuals from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), we integrated [~]3000 plasma proteins with clinical information to derive sparse prediction models for the 10-year incidence of 218 common and rare diseases (81 - 6038 cases). We compared prediction models based on proteins with a) basic clinical information alone, b) basic clinical information + 37 clinical biomarkers, and c) genome-wide polygenic risk scores. ResultsFor 67 pathologically diverse diseases, a model including as few as 5 to 20 proteins was superior to clinical models (median delta C-index = 0.07; range = 0.02 - 0.31) and to clinical models with biomarkers for 52 diseases. In multiple myeloma, for example, a set of 5 proteins significantly improved prediction over basic clinical information (delta C-index = 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.20 - 0.29)). At a 5% false positive rate (FPR), proteomic prediction (5 proteins) identified individuals at high risk of multiple myeloma (detection rate (DR) = 50%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DR = 55%) and motor neuron disease (DR = 29%). At a 20% FPR, proteomic prediction identified individuals at high-risk for pulmonary fibrosis (DR= 80%) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DR = 75%). ConclusionsSparse plasma protein signatures offer novel, clinically useful prediction of common and rare diseases, through disease-specific proteins and protein predictors shared across multiple diseases.

G.; Abdul Aziz, N.; Hope, R.; Lopez Bernal, J.; Gallagher, E.; Dabrera, G.; Thelwall, S.\nScore: 152.7, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292656\nSince the emergence of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2021, a number of sub-lineages have arisen and circulated internationally. Little is known about the relative severity of Omicron sub-lineages BA.2.75, BA.4.6 and BQ.1. We undertook a case-control analysis to determine the clinical severity of these lineages relative to BA.5, using whole genome sequenced, PCR-confirmed infections, between 1 August 2022 to 27 November 2022, among those who presented to emergency care in England 14 days after and up to one day prior to the positive specimen. A total of 10,375 episodes were included in the analysis, of which 5,207 (50.2%) were admitted to hospital or died. Multivariable conditional regression analyses found no evidence for greater odds of hospital admission or death among those with BA.2.75 (OR= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.09), and BA.4.6 (OR= 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.17) or BQ.1 (OR= 1.03, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 1.13) compared to BA.5. Future lineages may not follow the same trend and there remains a need for continued surveillance of COVID-19 variants and their clinical outcomes to inform the public health response.\nInterpretation of wide confidence intervals in meta-analytic estimates: Is the 'Absence of Evidence' 'Evidence of Absence'?\nAuthors: Miller, S. L.; Tuia, J.; Prasad, V.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.23292513\nIntroductionRecently, a Cochrane review by Jefferson et al. on physical interventions to slow the spread of respiratory viruses concluded that, \"Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 compared to not wearing masks\", though this finding had a wide confidence interval. Cochrane issued a rare clarifying statement, fueling controversy. We sought to contextualize the findings of the review by Jefferson et al. MethodsWe searched for consecutive reviews by Cochrane published on or before March 9th, 2023. We included studies where a central finding showed an intervention offered no statistically significant benefit, and ascertained the language used by reviewers to describe that result. We compare this to the report by Jefferson et al., and deemed it consistent or inconsistent with the language of their report. ResultsWe found between November 21st, 2022, and March 9th, 2023, there were 20 Cochrane reviews that met the inclusion criteria. We found that 95% (n = 19) of the reviews used language that was consistent with Jeffersons findings, while 5% (n = 1) used language inconsistent with Jeffersons conclusion, describing the effect of the intervention on the outcome as \"unclear\". DiscussionMost reviews performed by Cochrane conclude that interventions which fail to show statistically significant benefits make \"no difference\" have \"no effect\" or do not \"increase or decrease\" the outcome, and this occurs despite wide confidence intervals. The conclusions by Jefferson et al. are consistent with Cochrane reporting guidelines and clarification from the organization was unjustified.\nCOVID-19 mitigation behaviors and policies limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States from September 2020 through November 2021\nAuthors: Lopez, V. K.; Kada, S.; Prasad, P. V.; Chin, T.; Cadwell, B. L.; Healy, J. M.; Slayton, R. B.; Biggerstaff, M.; Johansson, M. A.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292882\nUnited States jurisdictions implemented varied policies to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Understanding patterns of these policies alongside individuals behaviors can inform effective outbreak response. To do so, we estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt), a weekly measure of real-time transmission using US COVID-19 cases from September 2020-November 2021. We then assessed the association between Rt and policies, personal COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, variants, immunity, and social vulnerability indicators using two multi-level regression models. First, we fit a model with state-level policy stringency according to the Oxford Stringency Index, a composite indicator reflecting the strictness of COVID-19 policies and strength of pandemic-related communication. Our second model included a subset of specific policies. We found that personal mitigation behaviors and vaccination were more strongly associated with decreased transmission than policies. Importantly, transmission was reduced not by a single measure, but by various layered measures. These results underscore the need for policy, behavior change, and risk communication integration to reduce virus transmission during epidemics.\nGenomic Analysis and Surveillance of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Using Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE)\nAuthors: Allen, D. M.; Reyne, M. I.; Allingham, P.; Levickas, A.; Bell, S. H.; Lock, J.; Coey, J. D.; Carson, S.; Lee, A. J.; McSparron, C.; Nejad, B. F.; McKenna, J.; Shannon, M.; Li, K.; Curran, T.; Broadbent, L. J.; Downey, D. G.; Power, U. F.; Groves, H. E.; McKinley, J. M.; McGrath, J. W.; Bamford, C. G. G.; Gilpin, D. F.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23293016\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe infections in infants, immunocompromised or elderly individuals resulting in annual epidemics of respiratory disease. Currently, limited clinical RSV surveillance and the lack of predictable RSV seasonal dynamics and limits the public health response. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has the capacity to determine levels of health-associated biomarkers and has recently been used globally as a key metric in determining prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. However, the application of genomic WBE for the surveillance of other respiratory viruses is limited. In this study, we present an integrated genomic WBE approach, using RT-qPCR and partial sequencing of the G gene to monitor RSV levels and variants in the community across 2 years encompassing two periods of high RSV clinical positivity in Northern Ireland. We report increasing detection of RSV in wastewater concomitant with increasing numbers of RSV positive clinical cases. Furthermore, analysis of wastewater-derived RSV sequences permitted subtyping, genotyping, and identification of distinct circulating lineages within and between seasons. Altogether, our genomic WBE platform has the potential to complement ongoing global surveillance efforts and aid the management of RSV by informing the timely deployment of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.\nRobust use of phenotypic heterogeneity at drug target genes for mechanistic insights: application of cis-multivariable Mendelian randomization to GLP1R gene region\nAuthors: Patel, A.; Gill, D.; Shungin, D.; Mantzoros, C. S.; Knudsen, L. B.; Bowden, J.; Burgess, S.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292958\nPhenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.\nThe Impact of the UK COVID-19 Lockdown on the Screening, Diagnostics and Incidence of Breast, Colorectal, Lung and Prostate Cancer in the UK: a Population-Based Cohort Study\nAuthors: Barclay, N. L.; Pineda-Moncusi, M. L.; Jodicke, A. M.; Prieto-Alhambra, D.; Raventos, B.; Newby, D.; Delmestri, A.; Man, W. Y.; Chen, X.; Catala, M.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292937\nObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the screening and diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. The study also investigated whether the rates returned to pre-pandemic levels by December 2021. DesignCohort study. SettingElectronic health records from UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database. ParticipantsThe study included individuals registered with CPRD GOLD between January 2017 and December 2021, with at least 365 days of prior observation. Main outcome measuresThe study focused on screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses of first-ever breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Incidence rates (IR) were stratified by age, sex and region, and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated to compare rates during and after lockdown with the reference period before lockdown. Forecasted rates were estimated using negative binomial regression models. ResultsAmong 5,191,650 eligible participants, the initial lockdown resulted in reduced screening and diagnostic tests for all cancers, which remained dramatically reduced across the whole observation period for almost all tests investigated. For cancer incidence rates, there were significant IRR reductions in breast (0.69), colorectal (0.74), and prostate (0.71) cancers. However, the reduction in lung cancer incidence (0.92) was non-significant. Extrapolating to the entire UK population, an estimated 18,000 breast, 13,000 colorectal, 10,000 lung, and 21,000 prostate cancer diagnoses were missed from March 2020 to December 2021. ConclusionThe national COVID-19 lockdown in the UK had a substantial impact on cancer screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses. Although incidence rates started to recover after the lockdown, they remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels for breast and prostate cancers and associated tests. Delays in diagnosis are likely to have adverse consequences on cancer stage, treatment initiation, mortality rates, and years of life lost. Urgent strategies are needed to identify undiagnosed cases and address the long-term implications of delayed diagnoses. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIBreast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer are the most common causes of cancer death in the UK. C_LIO_LIThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of cancer screening programs and reductions in diagnostic tests, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation, impacting prognosis and mortality rates. C_LIO_LIComprehensive data on the impact of changing social restrictions and post-lockdown periods is lacking in the UK, along with an assessment of specific screening pathways and patient experiences within the healthcare system. C_LI WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe first UK national COVID-19 lockdown resulted in reductions in screening, diagnostic tests, and referrals, particularly for mammograms, colonoscopies, and visits to breast surgeons, leading to underdiagnosis of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Despite some increase in rates after the lockdown, they remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels by December 2021, particularly for prostate cancer. C_LIO_LIMost affected populations were women aged 60-79 years for breast and colorectal cancer; men aged 60-79 years for lung cancer; and men aged 40-59 years for prostate cancer. C_LIO_LIDelays in diagnosis are likely to have consequences on cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment initiation, mortality rates, and total years of life lost. Strategies such as public awareness campaigns, targeted screening programs, and improved coordination between primary care and hospitals are needed to address the backlog and identify the potential [~]62,000 missed cancer cases in the UK.

H.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292713\nThe health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure 1-3. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys 4 to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2{degrees}C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to[~] 3{degrees}C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa,per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.\nPatient-Related Metadata Reported in Sequencing Studies of SARS-CoV-2: Protocol for a Scoping Review and Bibliometric Analysis\nAuthors: OConnor, K.; Weissenbacher, D.; Elyaderani, A.; Scotch, M.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292681\nBackgroundSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented effort in genomic epidemiology to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 virus and examine its molecular evolution. This has been facilitated by the availability of publicly accessible databases, GISAID and GenBank, which collectively hold millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequence records. However, genomic epidemiology seeks to go beyond phylogenetic analysis by linking genetic information to patient demographics and disease outcomes, enabling a comprehensive understanding of transmission dynamics and disease impact. While these repositories include some patient-related information, such as the location of the infected host, the granularity of this data and the inclusion of demographic and clinical details are inconsistent. Additionally, the extent to which patient-related metadata is reported in published sequencing studies remains largely unexplored. Therefore, it is essential to assess the extent and quality of patient-related metadata reported in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. Moreover, there is limited linkage between published articles and sequence repositories, hindering the identification of relevant studies. Traditional search strategies based on keywords may miss relevant articles. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the use of an automated classifier to identify relevant articles. ObjectiveThis study aims to conduct a systematic and comprehensive scoping review, along with a bibliometric analysis, to assess the reporting of patient-related metadata in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. MethodsThe NIHs LitCovid collection will be used for the machine learning classification, while an independent search will be conducted in PubMed. Data extraction will be conducted using Covidence, and the extracted data will be synthesized and summarized to quantify the availability of patient metadata in the published literature of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. For the bibliometric analysis, relevant data points, such as author affiliations, journal information, and citation metrics, will be extracted. ResultsThe study will report findings on the extent and types of patient-related metadata reported in genomic viral sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2. The scoping review will identify gaps in the reporting of patient metadata and make recommendations for improving the quality and consistency of reporting in this area. The bibliometric analysis will uncover trends and patterns in the reporting of patient-related metadata, such as differences in reporting based on study types or geographic regions. Co-occurrence networks of author keywords will also be presented to highlight frequent themes and their associations with patient metadata reporting. ConclusionThis study will contribute to advancing knowledge in the field of genomic epidemiology by providing a comprehensive overview of the reporting of patient-related metadata in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. The insights gained from this study may help improve the quality and consistency of reporting patient metadata, enhancing the utility of sequence metadata and facilitating future research on infectious diseases. The findings may also inform the development of machine learning methods to automatically extract patient-related information from sequencing studies.\nEpidemiological and health economic implications of symptom propagation in respiratory pathogens: A mathematical modelling investigation\nAuthors: Asplin, P.; Keeling, M. J.; Mancy, R.; Hill, E. M.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292544\nBackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied. Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB). In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation. ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFor many diseases there are delays in diagnosis due to a lack of objective biomarkers for disease onset. Whether measuring thousands of proteins offers predictive information across a wide range of diseases is unknown.

MethodsIn 41,931 individuals from the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), we integrated [~]3000 plasma proteins with clinical information to derive sparse prediction models for the 10-year incidence of 218 common and rare diseases (81 - 6038 cases). We compared prediction models based on proteins with a) basic clinical information alone, b) basic clinical information &#43; 37 clinical biomarkers, and c) genome-wide polygenic risk scores.

ResultsFor 67 pathologically diverse diseases, a model including as few as 5 to 20 proteins was superior to clinical models (median delta C-index = 0.07; range = 0.02 - 0.31) and to clinical models with biomarkers for 52 diseases. In multiple myeloma, for example, a set of 5 proteins significantly improved prediction over basic clinical information (delta C-index = 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.20 - 0.29)). At a 5% false positive rate (FPR), proteomic prediction (5 proteins) identified individuals at high risk of multiple myeloma (detection rate (DR) = 50%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DR = 55%) and motor neuron disease (DR = 29%). At a 20% FPR, proteomic prediction identified individuals at high-risk for pulmonary fibrosis (DR= 80%) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DR = 75%).

ConclusionsSparse plasma protein signatures offer novel, clinically useful prediction of common and rare diseases, through disease-specific proteins and protein predictors shared across multiple diseases.

        <p class="abstract">Since the emergence of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2021, a number of sub-lineages have arisen and circulated internationally. Little is known about the relative severity of Omicron sub-lineages BA.2.75, BA.4.6 and BQ.1. We undertook a case-control analysis to determine the clinical severity of these lineages relative to BA.5, using whole genome sequenced, PCR-confirmed infections, between 1 August 2022 to 27 November 2022, among those who presented to emergency care in England 14 days after and up to one day prior to the positive specimen. A total of 10,375 episodes were included in the analysis, of which 5,207 (50.2%) were admitted to hospital or died. Multivariable conditional regression analyses found no evidence for greater odds of hospital admission or death among those with BA.2.75 (OR= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.09), and BA.4.6 (OR= 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.17) or BQ.1 (OR= 1.03, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 1.13) compared to BA.5. Future lineages may not follow the same trend and there remains a need for continued surveillance of COVID-19 variants and their clinical outcomes to inform the public health response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRecently, a Cochrane review by Jefferson et al. on physical interventions to slow the spread of respiratory viruses concluded that, &#34;Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 compared to not wearing masks&#34;, though this finding had a wide confidence interval. Cochrane issued a rare clarifying statement, fueling controversy. We sought to contextualize the findings of the review by Jefferson et al.

MethodsWe searched for consecutive reviews by Cochrane published on or before March 9th, 2023. We included studies where a central finding showed an intervention offered no statistically significant benefit, and ascertained the language used by reviewers to describe that result. We compare this to the report by Jefferson et al., and deemed it consistent or inconsistent with the language of their report.

ResultsWe found between November 21st, 2022, and March 9th, 2023, there were 20 Cochrane reviews that met the inclusion criteria. We found that 95% (n = 19) of the reviews used language that was consistent with Jeffersons findings, while 5% (n = 1) used language inconsistent with Jeffersons conclusion, describing the effect of the intervention on the outcome as &#34;unclear&#34;.

DiscussionMost reviews performed by Cochrane conclude that interventions which fail to show statistically significant benefits make &#34;no difference&#34; have &#34;no effect&#34; or do not &#34;increase or decrease&#34; the outcome, and this occurs despite wide confidence intervals. The conclusions by Jefferson et al. are consistent with Cochrane reporting guidelines and clarification from the organization was unjustified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">United States jurisdictions implemented varied policies to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Understanding patterns of these policies alongside individuals behaviors can inform effective outbreak response. To do so, we estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt), a weekly measure of real-time transmission using US COVID-19 cases from September 2020-November 2021. We then assessed the association between Rt and policies, personal COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, variants, immunity, and social vulnerability indicators using two multi-level regression models. First, we fit a model with state-level policy stringency according to the Oxford Stringency Index, a composite indicator reflecting the strictness of COVID-19 policies and strength of pandemic-related communication. Our second model included a subset of specific policies. We found that personal mitigation behaviors and vaccination were more strongly associated with decreased transmission than policies. Importantly, transmission was reduced not by a single measure, but by various layered measures. These results underscore the need for policy, behavior change, and risk communication integration to reduce virus transmission during epidemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe infections in infants, immunocompromised or elderly individuals resulting in annual epidemics of respiratory disease. Currently, limited clinical RSV surveillance and the lack of predictable RSV seasonal dynamics and limits the public health response. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has the capacity to determine levels of health-associated biomarkers and has recently been used globally as a key metric in determining prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. However, the application of genomic WBE for the surveillance of other respiratory viruses is limited.

In this study, we present an integrated genomic WBE approach, using RT-qPCR and partial sequencing of the G gene to monitor RSV levels and variants in the community across 2 years encompassing two periods of high RSV clinical positivity in Northern Ireland.

We report increasing detection of RSV in wastewater concomitant with increasing numbers of RSV positive clinical cases. Furthermore, analysis of wastewater-derived RSV sequences permitted subtyping, genotyping, and identification of distinct circulating lineages within and between seasons.

Altogether, our genomic WBE platform has the potential to complement ongoing global surveillance efforts and aid the management of RSV by informing the timely deployment of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phenotypic heterogeneity at genomic loci encoding drug targets can be exploited by multivariable Mendelian randomization to provide insight on the pathways by which pharmacological interventions may affect disease risk. However, statistical inference in such investigations may be poor if overdispersion heterogeneity in measured genetic associations is unaccounted for. In this work, we first develop conditional F-statistics for dimension-reduced genetic associations that enable more accurate measurement of phenotypic heterogeneity. We then develop a novel extension for two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization that accounts for overdispersion heterogeneity in dimension-reduced genetic associations. Our empirical focus is to use genetic variants in the GLP1R gene region to understand the mechanism by which GLP1R agonism affects coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Colocalization analyses indicate that distinct variants in the GLP1R gene region are associated with body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses that were corrected for overdispersion heterogeneity suggest that bodyweight lowering rather than type 2 diabetes liability lowering effects of GLP1R agonism are more likely contributing to reduced CAD risk. Tissue-specific analyses prioritised brain tissue as the most likely to be relevant for CAD risk, of the tissues considered. We hope the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach illustrated here is widely applicable to better understand mechanisms linking drug targets to diseases outcomes, and hence to guide drug development efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the screening and diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. The study also investigated whether the rates returned to pre-pandemic levels by December 2021.

DesignCohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database.

ParticipantsThe study included individuals registered with CPRD GOLD between January 2017 and December 2021, with at least 365 days of prior observation.

Main outcome measuresThe study focused on screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses of first-ever breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Incidence rates (IR) were stratified by age, sex and region, and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated to compare rates during and after lockdown with the reference period before lockdown. Forecasted rates were estimated using negative binomial regression models.

ResultsAmong 5,191,650 eligible participants, the initial lockdown resulted in reduced screening and diagnostic tests for all cancers, which remained dramatically reduced across the whole observation period for almost all tests investigated. For cancer incidence rates, there were significant IRR reductions in breast (0.69), colorectal (0.74), and prostate (0.71) cancers. However, the reduction in lung cancer incidence (0.92) was non-significant. Extrapolating to the entire UK population, an estimated 18,000 breast, 13,000 colorectal, 10,000 lung, and 21,000 prostate cancer diagnoses were missed from March 2020 to December 2021.

ConclusionThe national COVID-19 lockdown in the UK had a substantial impact on cancer screening, diagnostic tests, referrals and diagnoses. Although incidence rates started to recover after the lockdown, they remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels for breast and prostate cancers and associated tests. Delays in diagnosis are likely to have adverse consequences on cancer stage, treatment initiation, mortality rates, and years of life lost. Urgent strategies are needed to identify undiagnosed cases and address the long-term implications of delayed diagnoses.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe first UK national COVID-19 lockdown resulted in reductions in screening, diagnostic tests, and referrals, particularly for mammograms, colonoscopies, and visits to breast surgeons, leading to underdiagnosis of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Despite some increase in rates after the lockdown, they remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels by December 2021, particularly for prostate cancer.
C_LIO_LIMost affected populations were women aged 60-79 years for breast and colorectal cancer; men aged 60-79 years for lung cancer; and men aged 40-59 years for prostate cancer.
C_LIO_LIDelays in diagnosis are likely to have consequences on cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment initiation, mortality rates, and total years of life lost. Strategies such as public awareness campaigns, targeted screening programs, and improved coordination between primary care and hospitals are needed to address the backlog and identify the potential [~]62,000 missed cancer cases in the UK.

        <p class="abstract">The health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure 1-3. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys 4 to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2{degrees}C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to[~] 3{degrees}C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa,per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented effort in genomic epidemiology to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 virus and examine its molecular evolution. This has been facilitated by the availability of publicly accessible databases, GISAID and GenBank, which collectively hold millions of SARS-CoV-2 sequence records. However, genomic epidemiology seeks to go beyond phylogenetic analysis by linking genetic information to patient demographics and disease outcomes, enabling a comprehensive understanding of transmission dynamics and disease impact.

While these repositories include some patient-related information, such as the location of the infected host, the granularity of this data and the inclusion of demographic and clinical details are inconsistent. Additionally, the extent to which patient-related metadata is reported in published sequencing studies remains largely unexplored. Therefore, it is essential to assess the extent and quality of patient-related metadata reported in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies.

Moreover, there is limited linkage between published articles and sequence repositories, hindering the identification of relevant studies. Traditional search strategies based on keywords may miss relevant articles. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the use of an automated classifier to identify relevant articles.

ObjectiveThis study aims to conduct a systematic and comprehensive scoping review, along with a bibliometric analysis, to assess the reporting of patient-related metadata in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies.

MethodsThe NIHs LitCovid collection will be used for the machine learning classification, while an independent search will be conducted in PubMed. Data extraction will be conducted using Covidence, and the extracted data will be synthesized and summarized to quantify the availability of patient metadata in the published literature of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. For the bibliometric analysis, relevant data points, such as author affiliations, journal information, and citation metrics, will be extracted.

ResultsThe study will report findings on the extent and types of patient-related metadata reported in genomic viral sequencing studies of SARS-CoV-2. The scoping review will identify gaps in the reporting of patient metadata and make recommendations for improving the quality and consistency of reporting in this area. The bibliometric analysis will uncover trends and patterns in the reporting of patient-related metadata, such as differences in reporting based on study types or geographic regions. Co-occurrence networks of author keywords will also be presented to highlight frequent themes and their associations with patient metadata reporting.

ConclusionThis study will contribute to advancing knowledge in the field of genomic epidemiology by providing a comprehensive overview of the reporting of patient-related metadata in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing studies. The insights gained from this study may help improve the quality and consistency of reporting patient metadata, enhancing the utility of sequence metadata and facilitating future research on infectious diseases. The findings may also inform the development of machine learning methods to automatically extract patient-related information from sequencing studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.

Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying  tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB).

In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.

ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>
