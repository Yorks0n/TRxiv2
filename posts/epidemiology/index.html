R.\nScore: 45.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.19.23290239\nIntroductionDramatic increases in U.S. drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, beginning around 2014 have driven a marked progression in overall drug overdose deaths in the U.S., sharply rising after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in drug overdose deaths by educational attainment (EA) during the fentanyl era of the drug overdose epidemic and its intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic have not been widely scrutinized. MethodsUtilizing restricted-use mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the American Community Survey, we estimated annual national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) from drug overdoses jointly stratified by EA and sex for adults aged 25-64 from 2015 to 2021. State-level AAMRs in 2015 and 2021 were also estimated to examine the geographic variation in the cumulative evolution of EA-related disparities over the course of the analysis period. ResultsNationally, AAMRs rose fastest among persons with at most a high school-level education, whereas little to no change was observed for bachelors degree holders, widening pre-existing disparities. During the analysis period, the difference in national AAMRs between persons with at most a high school-level education and bachelors degree holders increased from less than 8-fold (2015) to approximately 13-fold (2021). The national widening of EA-related disparities accelerated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and they widened in nearly every state. Among non-bachelors degree holders, national AAMRs increased markedly faster for males. ConclusionsThe widening disparities in drug overdose deaths by EA are a likely indicator of a rapidly increasing socioeconomic divide in drug overdose mortality more broadly. Policy strategies should address upstream socioeconomic drivers of drug use and overdose, particularly among males.\nProtection of second booster vaccinations and prior infection against SARS-CoV-2 in the UK SIREN healthcare worker cohort\nAuthors: Kirwan, P. D.; Hall, V. J.; Foulkes, S.; Otter, A.; Munro, K.; Sparkes, D.; Howells, A.; Platt, N.; Broad, J.; Crossman, D.; Norman, C.; Corrigan, D.; Jackson, C. H.; Cole, M.; Brown, C. S.; Atti, A.; Islam, J.; SIREN Study Group, ; Presanis, A.; Charlett, A.; De Angelis, D.; Hopkins, S.\nScore: 27.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296330\nBackground The protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers. Methods Participants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated. Results 1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI -11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection \u003e2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection. Conclusions Despite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern.

In this work, we aimed to explore challenges related to self-report errors for biobank-scale research. We derived a reporting error score (RESUM) for n=73,129 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants, capturing inconsistent self-reporting in time-invariant phenotypes across multiple measurement occasions. We then performed genome-wide association scans on RESUM, applied downstream analyses (LD Score Regression and Mendelian Randomization, MR), and compared its properties to a previously studied participation behaviour (UKBB participation propensity). The results were then used in extended analyses (simulations, inverse probability and variance weighting) to explore patterns and propose possible corrections for biases induced by reporting error and/or selective participation. Finally, to assess the impact of reporting error on SNP effects and trait heritability, we improved phenotype resolution for 15 self-report measures and inspected the changes in genomic findings. Reporting error was present in the UKBB across all 33 assessed, time-invariant, measures, with repeatability levels as low as 11% (e.g., inconsistent recall of childhood sunburns). We found that reporting error was not independent from UKBB participation, evidenced by their negative genetic correlation (rg = -0.90), their shared causes (e.g., education, income, intelligence; assessed in MR) and the loss in self-report accuracy following participation bias correction. Depending on where reporting error occurred in the analytical pipeline, its impact ranged from reduced power (e.g., for gene-discovery) to biased effect estimates (e.g., if present in the exposure variable) and attenuation of genome-wide quantities (e.g., 20% relative h2-attenuation for self-reported childhood height). Our findings highlight that both self-report accuracy and selective participation are competing biases and sources of poor reproducibility for biobank-scale research. Implementation of approaches that aim to enhance phenotype resolution while ensuring sample representativeness are therefore essential when working with biobank data.\nSocio-demographic and genetic risk factors for drug adherence and persistence: a retrospective nation-wide and biobank study across 5 medication classes and 1 814 521 individuals\nAuthors: Cordioli, M.; Corbetta, A.; Kariis, H. M.; Jukarainen, S.; Vartiainen, P.; Kiiskinen, T.; Ferro, M.; FinnGen, ; Estonian Biobank research team, ; Lehto, K.; Niemi, M.; Ripatti, S.; Milani, L.; Ganna, A.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296740\nLow drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data). Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.\nCovid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, a nested case-control study in births from April 2021 to March 2022, England\nAuthors: Mensah, A. A.; Stowe, J.; Jardine, J. E.; Kirsebom, F. C.; Clare, T.; Kall, M.; Campbell, H.; Lopez-Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296737\nIntroduction: Vaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. Method: A matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participant's age and estimated week of conception. Results: 514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021- 31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.\nModelling the impact of population mobility, post-infection immunity and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Dominican Republic\nAuthors: Finch, E.; Nilles, E. J.; Then Paulino, C.; Skewes-Ramm, R.; Lau, C.; Lowe, R.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296586\nCOVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations. We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios. We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.\nDistrict Level Variation in Hypertension Epidemiology in India and Influence of Social Determinants: National Family Health Survey-5\nAuthors: Gupta, R.; Gaur, K.; Sharma, S. C.; Khedar, R. S.; Dhamija, R. K.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296421\nBACKGROUNDEnumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants. METHODSWe used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report. RESULTSAge-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (\u003c30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p\u003c0.05). CONCLUSIONSThe study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women. SUMMARY TABLE What is known about the topicO_LISignificant state-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India has been reported but district-level variation is not known. C_LIO_LISocial determinants are important in hypertension but not well studied, especially in women. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThe study shows a significant district-level variation with greater hypertension prevalence in southern and western India. C_LIO_LIHypertension among the young, \u003c30 years, is more in less developed districts.

M.; Masel, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296661\nIn this paper, we present a simple model that shows how to optimally target interventions based on the estimated risk of infectiousness of individuals. Our model can help policymakers decide when to use different types of interventions during a pandemic, depending on their precision, which is the fraction of positive predictions that are true positives. We show that targeted interventions, even with very low precision, can impose a much smaller overall burden on the population than non-targeted alternatives, such as lockdowns or mass testing. To illustrate this, we use data from the NHS contact tracing system in the UK to construct a risk function based on second degree contact tracing, which is similar to the strategy used by Vietnam in 2020. We find that with moderate precision (greater than 1/1000) and sufficient sensitivity (greater than 1-1/R0), countries can cope with a large number of imported cases without resorting to social distancing measures, while keeping the per-person probabilities of both infection and quarantine very low. We also show that targeted strategies are often orders of magnitude better than default strategies, making them robustly beneficial even under significant uncertainty about most parameters.\nUnited States Marijuana Legalization and Opioid Mortality Trends Before and During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Bleyer, A.; Barnes, B.; Finn, K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296502\nTo determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.\nThe role of socio-economic disparities in the relative success of SARS-CoV-2 variants in New York City in early 2021\nAuthors: Vasylyeva, T. I.; Havens, J. L.; Wang, J. C.; Luoma, E.; Hassler, G. W.; Amin, H.; Di Lonardo, S.; Taki, F.; Omoregie, E.; Hughes, S.; Wertheim, J. O.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296367\nBackgroundSocio-economic disparities were associated with disproportionate viral incidence between neighborhoods of New York City (NYC) during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how these disparities affected the co-circulation SARS-CoV-2 variants during the second wave in NYC. MethodsWe tested for correlation between the prevalence, in late 2020/early 2021, of Alpha, Iota, Iota with E484K mutation (Iota-E484K), and B.1-like genomes and pre-existing immunity (seropositivity) in NYC neighborhoods. In the context of varying seroprevalence we described socio-economic profiles of neighborhoods and performed migration and lineage persistence analyses using a Bayesian phylogeographical framework. FindingsSeropositivity was greater in areas with high poverty and a larger proportion of Black and Hispanic or Latino residents. Seropositivity was positively correlated with the proportion of Iota-E484K and Iota genomes, and negatively correlated with the proportion of Alpha and B.1-like genomes. The proportion of persisting Alpha lineages declined over time in locations with high seroprevalence, whereas the proportion of persisting Iota-E484K lineages remained the same in high seroprevalence areas. InterpretationDuring the second wave, the geographic variation of standing immunity, due to disproportionate disease burden during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in NYC, allowed for the immune evasive Iota-E484K variant, but not the more transmissible Alpha variant, to circulate in locations with high pre-existing immunity.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionDramatic increases in U.S. drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, beginning around 2014 have driven a marked progression in overall drug overdose deaths in the U.S., sharply rising after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in drug overdose deaths by educational attainment (EA) during the fentanyl era of the drug overdose epidemic and its intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic have not been widely scrutinized.

MethodsUtilizing restricted-use mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the American Community Survey, we estimated annual national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) from drug overdoses jointly stratified by EA and sex for adults aged 25-64 from 2015 to 2021. State-level AAMRs in 2015 and 2021 were also estimated to examine the geographic variation in the cumulative evolution of EA-related disparities over the course of the analysis period.

ResultsNationally, AAMRs rose fastest among persons with at most a high school-level education, whereas little to no change was observed for bachelors degree holders, widening pre-existing disparities. During the analysis period, the difference in national AAMRs between persons with at most a high school-level education and bachelors degree holders increased from less than 8-fold (2015) to approximately 13-fold (2021). The national widening of EA-related disparities accelerated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and they widened in nearly every state. Among non-bachelors degree holders, national AAMRs increased markedly faster for males.

ConclusionsThe widening disparities in drug overdose deaths by EA are a likely indicator of a rapidly increasing socioeconomic divide in drug overdose mortality more broadly. Policy strategies should address upstream socioeconomic drivers of drug use and overdose, particularly among males.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background &lt;br /&gt; The protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers. &lt;br /&gt; Methods &lt;br /&gt; Participants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated. &lt;br /&gt; Results &lt;br /&gt; 1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI -11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection &gt;2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection. &lt;br /&gt; Conclusions &lt;br /&gt; Despite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern. &lt;br /&gt; Funding &lt;br /&gt; UK Health Security Agency, Medical Research Council, NIHR HPRU Oxford, and others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While the use of short self-report measures is common practice in biobank initiatives, such phenotyping strategy is inherently prone to reporting errors. In this work, we aimed to explore challenges related to self-report errors for biobank-scale research. We derived a reporting error score (RESUM) for n=73,129 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants, capturing inconsistent self-reporting in time-invariant phenotypes across multiple measurement occasions. We then performed genome-wide association scans on RESUM, applied downstream analyses (LD Score Regression and Mendelian Randomization, MR), and compared its properties to a previously studied participation behaviour (UKBB participation propensity). The results were then used in extended analyses (simulations, inverse probability and variance weighting) to explore patterns and propose possible corrections for biases induced by reporting error and/or selective participation. Finally, to assess the impact of reporting error on SNP effects and trait heritability, we improved phenotype resolution for 15 self-report measures and inspected the changes in genomic findings. Reporting error was present in the UKBB across all 33 assessed, time-invariant, measures, with repeatability levels as low as 11% (e.g., inconsistent recall of childhood sunburns). We found that reporting error was not independent from UKBB participation, evidenced by their negative genetic correlation (rg = -0.90), their shared causes (e.g., education, income, intelligence; assessed in MR) and the loss in self-report accuracy following participation bias correction. Depending on where reporting error occurred in the analytical pipeline, its impact ranged from reduced power (e.g., for gene-discovery) to biased effect estimates (e.g., if present in the exposure variable) and attenuation of genome-wide quantities (e.g., 20% relative h2-attenuation for self-reported childhood height). Our findings highlight that both self-report accuracy and selective participation are competing biases and sources of poor reproducibility for biobank-scale research. Implementation of approaches that aim to enhance phenotype resolution while ensuring sample representativeness are therefore essential when working with biobank data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data). Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Vaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. Method: A matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participant&#39;s age and estimated week of conception. Results: 514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021- 31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations.

We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios.

We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to  buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDEnumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants.

METHODSWe used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report.

RESULTSAge-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (&lt;30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p&lt;0.05).

CONCLUSIONSThe study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women.

        <p class="abstract">In this paper, we present a simple model that shows how to optimally target interventions based on the estimated risk of infectiousness of individuals. Our model can help policymakers decide when to use different types of interventions during a pandemic, depending on their precision, which is the fraction of positive predictions that are true positives. We show that targeted interventions, even with very low precision, can impose a much smaller overall burden on the population than non-targeted alternatives, such as lockdowns or mass testing. To illustrate this, we use data from the NHS contact tracing system in the UK to construct a risk function based on second degree contact tracing, which is similar to the strategy used by Vietnam in 2020. We find that with moderate precision (greater than 1/1000) and sufficient sensitivity (greater than 1-1/R0), countries can cope with a large number of imported cases without resorting to social distancing measures, while keeping the per-person probabilities of both infection and quarantine very low. We also show that targeted strategies are often orders of magnitude better than default strategies, making them robustly beneficial even under significant uncertainty about most parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSocio-economic disparities were associated with disproportionate viral incidence between neighborhoods of New York City (NYC) during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how these disparities affected the co-circulation SARS-CoV-2 variants during the second wave in NYC.

MethodsWe tested for correlation between the prevalence, in late 2020/early 2021, of Alpha, Iota, Iota with E484K mutation (Iota-E484K), and B.1-like genomes and pre-existing immunity (seropositivity) in NYC neighborhoods. In the context of varying seroprevalence we described socio-economic profiles of neighborhoods and performed migration and lineage persistence analyses using a Bayesian phylogeographical framework.

FindingsSeropositivity was greater in areas with high poverty and a larger proportion of Black and Hispanic or Latino residents. Seropositivity was positively correlated with the proportion of Iota-E484K and Iota genomes, and negatively correlated with the proportion of Alpha and B.1-like genomes. The proportion of persisting Alpha lineages declined over time in locations with high seroprevalence, whereas the proportion of persisting Iota-E484K lineages remained the same in high seroprevalence areas.

InterpretationDuring the second wave, the geographic variation of standing immunity, due to disproportionate disease burden during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in NYC, allowed for the immune evasive Iota-E484K variant, but not the more transmissible Alpha variant, to circulate in locations with high pre-existing immunity.
