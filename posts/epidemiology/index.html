A.\nScore: 1135.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: RESULTS FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT\nAuthors: Sekendiz, Z.; Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Carr, M. A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 48.4, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackground: Cognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. Objective: To determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. Results: The mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04 (SD=6.6) years, while that of the control group was 58.1 (SD=7.3) years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput ((B=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: COVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nEffects of childhood and adult height on later life cardiovascular disease risk estimated through Mendelian randomization\nAuthors: Richardson, T. G.; Urquijo, H.; Howe, L. J.; Hawkes, G.; Frayling, T. M.; Davey Smith, G.\nScore: 40.0, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296922\nBackgroundTaller individuals are at elevated and protected risk of various cardiovascular disease endpoints. Whether this is due to a direct consequence of their height during childhood, a long-term effect of remaining tall throughout the lifecourse, or confounding by other factors, is unknown. MethodsWe sought to address this by harnessing human genetic data to separate the independent effects of childhood and adulthood height using an approach known as lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR). We analysed 5 cardiovascular disease endpoints (coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)) using findings from large-scale genome-wide consortia (n=184,305 to 1,030,836). ResultsProtective effects of taller childhood height on risk of later life CAD (OR=0.78 per change in height category, 95% CI=0.70 to 0.86, P=4x10 -10) and stroke (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.86 to 1.00, P=0.03) were found using a univariable model, although evidence of these effects attenuated in a multivariable setting upon accounting for adulthood height. In contrast, direct effects of taller childhood height on increased risk of later life AF (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.42 to 1.79, P=5x10 -7) and TAA (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.95, P=0.03) were found even after accounting for adulthood height in the multivariable model. ConclusionsThe protective effect of childhood height on risk of CAD and stroke is largely attributed to the causal pathway involving adulthood height, w hich may therefore be explained by taller children typically becoming taller individuals in later life. Conversely, the independent effect of childhood height on increased risk of AF and TAA may point towards developmental mechanisms in early life which confer a lifelong risk on these disease outcomes.\nInfluenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Lee, Y.-C.; Liu, L.; Yuan, L.; Risk, M.; Heinrich, K.; Witteveen-Lane, M.; Hayek, S.; Malosh, R.; Pop-Busui, R.; Jiang, B.; Shen, C.; Chesla, D.; Kennedy, R.; Shi, X.; Sims, M.; Homayouni, R.; Zhao, L.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297682\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p\u003c0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p\u003c0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p \u003c0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p \u003c0.001). ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.\nBody mass index and all-cause mortality in HUNT and UK Biobank studies: revised non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses\nAuthors: Burgess, S.; Sun, Y.-Q.; Zhou, A.; Buck, C.; Mason, A. M.; Mai, X.-M.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297612\nObjectivesTo estimate the shape of the causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality risk in a Mendelian randomization framework. DesignMendelian randomization analyses of two prospective population-based cohorts. SettingIndividuals of European ancestries living in Norway or the United Kingdom. Participants56,150 participants from the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway and 366,385 participants from UK Biobank recruited by postal invitation. OutcomesAll-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, non-cardiovascular non-cancer). ResultsA previously published non-linear Mendelian randomization analysis of these data using the residual stratification method suggested a J-shaped association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality outcomes with the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of around 25 kg/m2. However, the \"constant genetic effect\" assumption required by this method is violated. The re-analysis of these data using the more reliable doubly-ranked stratification method still indicated a J-shaped relationship, but with less precision in estimates at the lower end of the BMI distribution. Evidence for a harmful effect of reducing BMI at low BMI levels was only present in some analyses, and where present, only below 20 kg/m2. A harmful effect of increasing BMI for all-cause mortality was evident above 25 kg/m2, for cardiovascular mortality above 24 kg/m2, for non-cardiovascular non-cancer mortality above 26 kg/m2, and for cancer mortality above 30 kg/m2. In UK Biobank, the association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality at high BMI levels was stronger in women than in men. ConclusionThis research challenges findings from previous conventional observational epidemiology and Mendelian randomization investigations that the lowest level of mortality risk is at a BMI level of around 25 kg/m2. Our results provide evidence that reductions in BMI will only increase mortality risk for a small proportion of the population, and increases in BMI will increase mortality risk for those with BMI above 25 kg/m2. Strengths and limitations of the studyO_LIMendelian randomization design minimizes bias due to confounding and reverse causation C_LIO_LILarge sample sizes enable powerful analyses even in low BMI individuals C_LIO_LIValidity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables cannot be verified C_LIO_LIBias due to selection could be non-negligible and could vary across strata C_LIO_LIAll estimates are averaged across a stratum of the population; individual effects of raising or lowering BMI may vary between individuals C_LI\nUrinary Metal Levels and Coronary Artery Calcification: Longitudinal Evidence in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)\nAuthors: McGraw, K. E.; Schilling, K.; Glabonjat, R. A.; Galvez-Fernandez, M.; Domingo-Relloso, A.; Martinez-Morata, I.; Jones, M. R.; Post, W. S.; Kaufman, J. D.; Tellez-Plaza, M.; Valeri, L.; Brown, E.; Kronmal, R.; Barr, R. G.; Shea, S.; Navas-Acien, A.; Sanchez, T. R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297878\nObjectiveGrowing evidence indicates that exposure to metals are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that higher urinary levels of metals with prior evidence of an association with CVD, including non-essential (cadmium, tungsten, and uranium) and essential (cobalt, copper, and zinc) metals are associated with baseline and rate of change of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, a subclinical marker of atherosclerotic CVD. MethodsWe analyzed data from 6,418 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with spot urinary metal levels at baseline (2000-2002) and 1-4 repeated measures of spatially weighted coronary calcium score (SWCS) over a ten-year period. SWCS is a unitless measure of CAC highly correlated to the Agatston score but with numerical values assigned to individuals with Agatston score=0. We used linear mixed effect models to assess the association of baseline urinary metal levels with baseline SWCS, annual change in SWCS, and SWCS over ten years of follow-up. Urinary metals (adjusted to {micro}g/g creatinine) and SWCS were log transformed. Models were progressively adjusted for baseline sociodemographic factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate, lifestyle factors, and clinical factors. ResultsAt baseline, the median and interquartile range (25th, 75th) of SWCS was 6.3 (0.7, 58.2). For urinary cadmium, the fully adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR) (95%Cl) of SWCS comparing the highest to the lowest quartile was 1.51 (1.32, 1.74) at baseline and 1.75 (1.47, 2.07) at ten years of follow-up. For urinary tungsten, uranium, and cobalt the corresponding GMRs at ten years of follow-up were 1.45 (1.23, 1.71), 1.39 (1.17, 1.64), and 1.47 (1.25, 1.74), respectively. For copper and zinc, the association was attenuated with adjustment for clinical risk factors; GMRs at ten years of follow-up before and after adjustment for clinical risk factors were 1.55 (1.30, 1.84) and 1.33 (1.12, 1.58), respectively, for copper and 1.85 (1.56, 2.19) and 1.57 (1.33, 1.85) for zinc. ConclusionHigher levels of cadmium, tungsten, uranium, cobalt, copper, and zinc, as measured in urine, were associated with subclinical CVD at baseline and at follow-up. These findings support the hypothesis that metals are pro-atherogenic factors. CLINICAL PERSPECTIVEWhat is new? O_LIUrinary levels of non-essential (cadmium, tungsten, uranium) and essential metals (cobalt, copper, zinc) are associated with coronary artery calcification at baseline and at ten years of follow up in a diverse US sample. C_LI What are the clinical implications? O_LIReductions in environmental metal exposure may improve cardiovascular health. C_LIO_LIDietary and chelation interventions to reduce metals in the body may improve CVD outcomes.

However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p \u003c 6.42x10-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis ({beta} = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta ({beta}=-0.154, p=1.5x10-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Walds ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7x10-3 to 4.58x10-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.\nFrom Genomics Data to Causality: An Integrated Pipeline for Mendelian Randomization\nAuthors: Sharma, J.; Jangale, V.; Swain, A. K.; Yadav, P.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.23298053\nBackgroundMendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a valuable tool for causal inference in genetic epidemiology. Existing MR methods have issues related to pleiotropy and offer limited comprehensiveness. Here, we introduce an integrated MR analysis pipeline designed for GWAS summary statistics data. Our pipeline integrates feature selection, harmonization, and checkpoint mechanisms to improve the accuracy and reliability of MR analysis. MethodsIn classical GWAS, the p-value threshold usually does not guarantee to identify causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In such cases, t-statistics can be considered as imperative and robust criteria for identifying causal SNPs. Therefore, in this study, we computed the t-statistic for all independent SNPs remained after linkage disequilibrium pruning. Next, prior to harmonization, we removed SNPs having a t-statistic below the average t-statistic value. Furthermore, our pipeline incorporates sensitivity analysis tests at each step to reduce the chances of directional pleiotropy. Result and ConclusionWe applied our pipeline to single-sample and two-sample MR study designs, encompassing diverse populations and a wide range of diseases. Our results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing MR methods. In conclusion, our research presents an integrated MR analysis pipeline that significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of MR studies. By outperforming existing methods and providing comprehensive validation, this pipeline represents a valuable tool for researchers in genetics and epidemiology.\nSerological markers and Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC): A rapid review of the evidence\nAuthors: Collins, E.; Philippe, E.; Gravel, C.; Hawken, S.; Langlois, M.-A.; Little, J.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297455\nBackgroundPost COVID-19 Condition (PCC) is highly heterogeneous, often debilitating, and may last for years after infection. The etiology of PCC remains uncertain. Examination of potential serological markers of PCC, accounting for clinical covariates, may yield emergent pathophysiological insights. MethodsIn adherence to PRISMA guidelines, we carried out a rapid review of the literature. We searched Medline and Embase for primary observational studies that compared IgG response in individuals who experienced COVID-19 symptoms persisting [\u0026ge;]12 weeks post-infection with those who did not. We examined relationships between serological markers and PCC status and investigated sources of inter-study variability, such as severity of acute illness, PCC symptoms assessed, and target antigen(s). ResultsOf 8,018 unique records, we identified 29 as being eligible for inclusion in synthesis. Definitions of PCC varied. In studies that reported anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG (n=10 studies; n=989 participants in aggregate), full or partial anti-Spike IgG (i.e., the whole trimer, S1 or S2 subgroups, or receptor binding domain, n=19 studies; n=2606 participants), or neutralizing response (n=7 studies; n=1123 participants), we did not find strong evidence to support any difference in serological markers between groups with and without persisting symptoms. However, most studies did not account for severity or level of care required during acute illness, and other potential confounders. ConclusionsPooling of studies would enable more robust exploration of clinical and serological predictors among diverse populations. However, substantial inter-study variations hamper comparability. Standardized reporting practices would improve the quality, consistency, and comprehension of study findings.\nAssessing the causal effect of air pollution on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Navaratnam, A. M. D.; Beale, S.; Boukari, Y.; Nguyen, V.; Fong, W. L. E.; Braithwaite, I.; Byrne, T. E.; Fragaszy, E.; Geismar, C.; Kovar, J.; Patel, P.; Shrotri, M.; Yavlinsky, A.; Hayward, A.; Khreis, H.; Aldridge, R. W.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297598\nIntroductionEmerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations. MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects. ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data. ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Cognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. Objective: To determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. Results: The mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04 (SD=6.6) years, while that of the control group was 58.1 (SD=7.3) years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput ((B=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: COVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTaller individuals are at elevated and protected risk of various cardiovascular disease endpoints. Whether this is due to a direct consequence of their height during childhood, a long-term effect of remaining tall throughout the lifecourse, or confounding by other factors, is unknown.

MethodsWe sought to address this by harnessing human genetic data to separate the independent effects of childhood and adulthood height using an approach known as lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR). We analysed 5 cardiovascular disease endpoints (coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)) using findings from large-scale genome-wide consortia (n=184,305 to 1,030,836).

ResultsProtective effects of taller childhood height on risk of later life CAD (OR=0.78 per change in height category, 95% CI=0.70 to 0.86, P=4x10 -10) and stroke (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.86 to 1.00, P=0.03) were found using a univariable model, although evidence of these effects attenuated in a multivariable setting upon accounting for adulthood height. In contrast, direct effects of taller childhood height on increased risk of later life AF (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.42 to 1.79, P=5x10 -7) and TAA (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.95, P=0.03) were found even after accounting for adulthood height in the multivariable model.

ConclusionsThe protective effect of childhood height on risk of CAD and stroke is largely attributed to the causal pathway involving adulthood height, w hich may therefore be explained by taller children typically becoming taller individuals in later life. Conversely, the independent effect of childhood height on increased risk of AF and TAA may point towards developmental mechanisms in early life which confer a lifelong risk on these disease outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022).

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p&lt;0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p&lt;0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p &lt;0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p &lt;0.001).

ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo estimate the shape of the causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality risk in a Mendelian randomization framework.

DesignMendelian randomization analyses of two prospective population-based cohorts.

SettingIndividuals of European ancestries living in Norway or the United Kingdom.

Participants56,150 participants from the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway and 366,385 participants from UK Biobank recruited by postal invitation.

OutcomesAll-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, non-cardiovascular non-cancer).

ResultsA previously published non-linear Mendelian randomization analysis of these data using the residual stratification method suggested a J-shaped association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality outcomes with the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of around 25 kg/m2. However, the &#34;constant genetic effect&#34; assumption required by this method is violated. The re-analysis of these data using the more reliable doubly-ranked stratification method still indicated a J-shaped relationship, but with less precision in estimates at the lower end of the BMI distribution. Evidence for a harmful effect of reducing BMI at low BMI levels was only present in some analyses, and where present, only below 20 kg/m2. A harmful effect of increasing BMI for all-cause mortality was evident above 25 kg/m2, for cardiovascular mortality above 24 kg/m2, for non-cardiovascular non-cancer mortality above 26 kg/m2, and for cancer mortality above 30 kg/m2. In UK Biobank, the association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality at high BMI levels was stronger in women than in men.

ConclusionThis research challenges findings from previous conventional observational epidemiology and Mendelian randomization investigations that the lowest level of mortality risk is at a BMI level of around 25 kg/m2. Our results provide evidence that reductions in BMI will only increase mortality risk for a small proportion of the population, and increases in BMI will increase mortality risk for those with BMI above 25 kg/m2.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveGrowing evidence indicates that exposure to metals are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that higher urinary levels of metals with prior evidence of an association with CVD, including non-essential (cadmium, tungsten, and uranium) and essential (cobalt, copper, and zinc) metals are associated with baseline and rate of change of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, a subclinical marker of atherosclerotic CVD.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 6,418 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with spot urinary metal levels at baseline (2000-2002) and 1-4 repeated measures of spatially weighted coronary calcium score (SWCS) over a ten-year period. SWCS is a unitless measure of CAC highly correlated to the Agatston score but with numerical values assigned to individuals with Agatston score=0. We used linear mixed effect models to assess the association of baseline urinary metal levels with baseline SWCS, annual change in SWCS, and SWCS over ten years of follow-up. Urinary metals (adjusted to {micro}g/g creatinine) and SWCS were log transformed. Models were progressively adjusted for baseline sociodemographic factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate, lifestyle factors, and clinical factors.

ResultsAt baseline, the median and interquartile range (25th, 75th) of SWCS was 6.3 (0.7, 58.2). For urinary cadmium, the fully adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR) (95%Cl) of SWCS comparing the highest to the lowest quartile was 1.51 (1.32, 1.74) at baseline and 1.75 (1.47, 2.07) at ten years of follow-up. For urinary tungsten, uranium, and cobalt the corresponding GMRs at ten years of follow-up were 1.45 (1.23, 1.71), 1.39 (1.17, 1.64), and 1.47 (1.25, 1.74), respectively. For copper and zinc, the association was attenuated with adjustment for clinical risk factors; GMRs at ten years of follow-up before and after adjustment for clinical risk factors were 1.55 (1.30, 1.84) and 1.33 (1.12, 1.58), respectively, for copper and 1.85 (1.56, 2.19) and 1.57 (1.33, 1.85) for zinc.

ConclusionHigher levels of cadmium, tungsten, uranium, cobalt, copper, and zinc, as measured in urine, were associated with subclinical CVD at baseline and at follow-up. These findings support the hypothesis that metals are pro-atherogenic factors.

        <p class="abstract">Major Depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p &lt; 6.42x10-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis ({beta} = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta ({beta}=-0.154, p=1.5x10-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Walds ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7x10-3 to 4.58x10-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a valuable tool for causal inference in genetic epidemiology. Existing MR methods have issues related to pleiotropy and offer limited comprehensiveness. Here, we introduce an integrated MR analysis pipeline designed for GWAS summary statistics data. Our pipeline integrates feature selection, harmonization, and checkpoint mechanisms to improve the accuracy and reliability of MR analysis.

MethodsIn classical GWAS, the p-value threshold usually does not guarantee to identify causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In such cases, t-statistics can be considered as imperative and robust criteria for identifying causal SNPs. Therefore, in this study, we computed the t-statistic for all independent SNPs remained after linkage disequilibrium pruning. Next, prior to harmonization, we removed SNPs having a t-statistic below the average t-statistic value. Furthermore, our pipeline incorporates sensitivity analysis tests at each step to reduce the chances of directional pleiotropy.

Result and ConclusionWe applied our pipeline to single-sample and two-sample MR study designs, encompassing diverse populations and a wide range of diseases. Our results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing MR methods. In conclusion, our research presents an integrated MR analysis pipeline that significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of MR studies. By outperforming existing methods and providing comprehensive validation, this pipeline represents a valuable tool for researchers in genetics and epidemiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost COVID-19 Condition (PCC) is highly heterogeneous, often debilitating, and may last for years after infection. The etiology of PCC remains uncertain. Examination of potential serological markers of PCC, accounting for clinical covariates, may yield emergent pathophysiological insights.

MethodsIn adherence to PRISMA guidelines, we carried out a rapid review of the literature. We searched Medline and Embase for primary observational studies that compared IgG response in individuals who experienced COVID-19 symptoms persisting [&amp;ge;]12 weeks post-infection with those who did not. We examined relationships between serological markers and PCC status and investigated sources of inter-study variability, such as severity of acute illness, PCC symptoms assessed, and target antigen(s).

ResultsOf 8,018 unique records, we identified 29 as being eligible for inclusion in synthesis. Definitions of PCC varied. In studies that reported anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG (n=10 studies; n=989 participants in aggregate), full or partial anti-Spike IgG (i.e., the whole trimer, S1 or S2 subgroups, or receptor binding domain, n=19 studies; n=2606 participants), or neutralizing response (n=7 studies; n=1123 participants), we did not find strong evidence to support any difference in serological markers between groups with and without persisting symptoms. However, most studies did not account for severity or level of care required during acute illness, and other potential confounders.

ConclusionsPooling of studies would enable more robust exploration of clinical and serological predictors among diverse populations. However, substantial inter-study variations hamper comparability. Standardized reporting practices would improve the quality, consistency, and comprehension of study findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations.

MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects.

ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data.

ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.</p>
