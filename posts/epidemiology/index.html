DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022. SettingCommunity Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received \u003e= 3 vaccine doses. Main outcome measuresPrevalence of Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression. Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p \u003c 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study. Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns \u003e=2 months after the acute illness. Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%). The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with \u003e=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare. The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.\nDiabetes following SARS-CoV-2 infection: Incidence, persistence, and implications of COVID-19 vaccination. A cohort study of fifteen million people.\nAuthors: Taylor, K.; Eastwood, S.; Walker, V.; Cezard, G.; Knight, R.; Al Arab, M.; Wei, Y.; Horne, E. M.

C.; Denholm, R.; CONVALESCENCE Long-COVID study, ; Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing and Data and Connectivity UK COVID-19 National Core Studies, ; OpenSAFELY collaborative, Score: 875.6, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.23293778\nBackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence is increased after diagnosis of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear. MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type. FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19. InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea. Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population. Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained. No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia. Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable. We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection. Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.\nLimited impact of lifting universal masks on SARS-COV-2 transmission in schools: The crucial role of outcome measurements\nAuthors: Li, M.; Yang, B.; Cowling, B. J.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294658\nAs the pandemics dynamics changed, many municipalities lifted face wearing requirement in school which was initially implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission within Massachusetts school districts. We first replicated previous research by Cowger et al. (2022) utilizing a Difference-in-Difference (DID) model. Then, we back project the case infection and calculate the Rt value to redo the DID analysis. However, when shifting the outcome measurement to the reproductive number (Rt), our findings suggest that lifting mask mandates can only significantly influence the Rt first two weeks post-intervention. This implies that while mask mandate plays a role in mitigation, its lifting does not drastically influence COVID-19 transmissibility in the long term.\nHigh proportions of post-exertional malaise and orthostatic intolerance in people living with post-COVID-19 condition: the PRIME post-COVID study\nAuthors: Pagen, D. M.; Van Herck, M.; van Bilsen, C. J.; Brinkhues, S.; Konings, K.; den Heijer, C. D.; Spruit, M. A.; Hoebe, C. J.; Dukers-Muijrers, N. H.\nScore: 298.8, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294204\nBackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors. MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex. ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [\u0026le;]60 years, [\u0026ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone. ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

G.; Richmond, R. C.; Sieh, W.; Rothstein, J. H.; Habel, L. A.; Alexeeff, S. E.; Lloyd-Lewis, B.; Sanderson, E.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294765\nObservational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR). We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD. Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA. In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.\nGenetic Insights into the Microevolutionary Dynamics and Early Introductions of Human Monkeypox Virus in Mexico\nAuthors: Gomez-Sanchez, I.; Castelan-Sanchez, H. G.; Martinez-Castilla, L. P.; Hurtado-Ramirez, J. M.; Lopez-Leal, G.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294674\nThe recent global outbreak of Monkeypox, caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPVX) emerged in Europe in 2022 and rapidly spread to over 40 countries. The Americas are currently facing the highest impact, reporting over 50,000 cases by early 2023. Here, we analyze 880 MPXV isolates worldwide to gain insights into the evolutionary patterns and initial introduction events of the virus in Mexico. We found that MPXV entered Mexico on multiple occasions, from the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Canada, and subsequently spread locally in different regions of Mexico. Additionally, we show that MPXV has an open pangenome, highlighting the role of gene turnover in shaping its genomic diversity, rather than SNPs variations, which do not contribute significantly to genome diversity. Although the genome presents multiple SNP sites in coding regions, these remain under purifying selection, suggesting their evolutionary conservation. One notable exception is the amino acid site 63 of the protein encoded by the Cop-A4L gene, intricately related to viral maturity, for which we picked up a strong signal of positive selection. Ancestral state reconstruction deduced that the ancestral state at site 63 corresponds to the amino acid valine, present only in isolates of clade I. However, the isolates of the current outbreak evolved for threonine at site 63. Finally, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the evolutionary processes of the Monkeypox virus.\nMEX-PD: A National Network for the Epidemiological \u0026 Genetic Research of Parkinson's Disease\nAuthors: Lazaro-Figueroa, A.; Reyes-Perez, P.; Morelos-Figaredo, E.; Guerra-Galicia, C. M.; Estrada-Bellmann, I.; Salinas-Barboza, K.; Matuk, Y.; Gandarilla-Martinez, N.

F.; Alcauter, S.; Renteria, M. E.; Medina-Rivera, A.; Ruiz-Contreras, A. E.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294700\nBackgroundParkinsons Disease (PD) has a complex etiology, involving genetic and environmental factors. Most of our current understanding of the disease comes from studies in populations with mostly European ancestry, representing challenges in generalizing findings to other populations with different genetic, social, and environmental contexts. There are scarce studies focused in Latin American populations. The Mexican population is genetically diverse because its admixture from Native American, European, and African ancestries, coupled with the unique environmental conditions, stressing the relevance of establishing genetic studies in this population. Thus, we have established the Mexican Parkinsons Research Network (MEX-PD), a consortium to research the clinical, genetical, environmental, and neurophysiological bases of the phenotypic diversity in Mexican PD patients. ObjectivesDescribing how MEX-PD was established, the methods and instruments and presenting the first results. MethodsPatients and controls were recruited from medical centers in 20 states of Mexico. Initial recruitment included neurological evaluation, cognitive assessment, and DNA collection. ResultsMEX-PD has registered 302 controls and 262 PD patients with a mean age of diagnosis of 61 years (SD=10.86). There were 19.8% PD patients identified with early onset. Levodopa was the most common pharmacological treatment. ConclusionsMEX-PD contributes to understand PD nationally. The information gathered here will allow us to understand the prevalence of mental health, neurological symptoms, and cognitive function in the PD Mexican population and how genetical and environmental factors contributes to those outcomes. These will advocate for personalized treatments and improving quality of life in the Mexican population.\nEstimating seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection after highly contagious Omicron outbreak: A cross sectional study in a university setting\nAuthors: Hou, C.-W.; Williams, S.; Trivino-Soto, G.; Boyle, V.; Rainford, D.; Vicino, S.; Magee, M.; Chung, Y.; Labaer, J.; Murugan, V.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23293775\nObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among individuals aged 18 years and older DesignProspective cohort study. SettingsPopulation-based study was conducted within the Arizona State University (ASU) community. ParticipantsThe study recruited 1,397 adult participants that volunteered over a period of three days (March 1-March 3 of 2022). Primary outcome measuresSeroprevalence was conducted in the community to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies resulting from previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or vaccination. ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies was found to be 96.3% using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay and 98% using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. For anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies, the seroprevalence was 39.1% by an ELISA assay and 41.4% by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Individuals that experienced breakthrough infections exhibited the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies. Additionally, saliva samples showed promise as a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels, as they exhibited a strong correlation with the data obtained from serum samples. ConclusionAccurate estimation of population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV- 2 will monitor the trend of infection in the community and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during and after outbreaks is crucial for informing the development of effective risk mitigation protocols within the community. Protocols may include measures such as encouraging booster shots, extending mask mandates, or transitioning to online classes. Serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in communities and prompt response to future outbreaks. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe simultaneously investigated active infection and seroprevalence for the university population. C_LIO_LIOur study was strengthened by having the participants self-report data independently validated with diagnostic tests. C_LIO_LISaliva samples could be a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels. C_LIO_LIOur study was performed within the university setting therefore it only reflects the COVID-19 situation within that community. C_LIO_LIThe number of breakthrough infections and the longitudinal samples were small, thus requiring confirmation.

Although endemic in humans and birds, novel IAV strains can emerge, jump species, and cause epidemics, like the latest variant of H5N1. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has very recently been shown to detect human IAV but whether it can detect avian-origin IAV, and if whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to discriminate circulating strains of IAV in wastewater remains unknown. MethodsUsing a pan-IAV RT-qPCR assay, six wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) across Northern Ireland (NI), were screened from August to December 2022. A WGS approach using Oxford Nanopore technology was employed to sequence positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences relative to currently circulating human and avian IAVs was performed. FindingsWe detected a dynamic IAV signal in wastewater from September 2022 onwards across NI. \"Meta\" whole genome sequences were generated displaying homology to both human and avian IAV strains. The relative proportion of human versus avian-origin IAV reads differed across time and sample site. A diversity in subtypes and lineages was detected (e.g. H1N1, H3N2, and several avian). Avian segment 8 related to those found in recent H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was identified. InterpretationWBE affords a means to monitor circulating human and avian IAV strains and provide crucial genetic information. As such WBE can provide rapid, cost-effective, year-round \"one-health\" IAV surveillance to help control epidemic and pandemic threats.

C_LI Author SummaryInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a major pathogen of humans and other animals and causes regular epidemics and devastating pandemics. Recently, a novel variant of highly-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has emerged spreading across the world killing millions of birds and infecting mammals, enhancing its pandemic potential. Strengthening global surveillance systems for human and animal IAV is thus a major priority. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been applied to track SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in humans but whether this approach could work for avian IAV is not known. Here, we develop a \"one-health\" method to survey pan-IAV levels and genetically characterise the viruses. Through this we highlight co-detection of human and avian IAVs in wastewater, with homology to recent H5N1 isolates. Our work demonstrates the potential for WBE to help defend against not only human infections but emerging, zoonotic IAVs of pandemic potential.

A vaccination strategy with fractional doses is a dose-saving strategy to address current vaccine shortages. Herein, we aimed to review the literature on administering fractional vaccine doses in Africa. MethodsA methodical search of PubMed was conducted to identify articles published up till March 31, 2023. Peer-reviewed studies were selected for inclusion if they focused on studies that described the use of fractional doses of vaccines and were conducted in any of the 54 African countries. ResultsFindings from eleven eligible studies were analyzed. Studies were from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. They covered five vaccines including the yellow fever vaccine (n=3; 27.3%), inactivated poliovirus vaccine (n=3; 27.3%), meningococcal A/C/Y/W135 vaccine (n=2; 18.2%), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (n=2; 18.2%), and malaria vaccine (n=1; 9.1%). Fractionated doses used most often consist of one-fifth of the standard dose (n=8; 72.7%). Regarding immunogenicity/efficacity, eight of ten studies that addressed immunogenicity suggest that immune responses to the fractional dose vaccines were comparable to that of the standard dose vaccines and resulted in higher antibody titers. Regarding safety, all of the eight studies that addressed the safety of fractional doses in Africa, suggest that safety and tolerability data of fractional dosing were favorable compared to full dose regimen. ConclusionFractional dosing may be considered to address the availability and acceptability of certain vaccines while maintaining protection. This strategy also has the potential advantage of reducing the cost of vaccination programs, vaccine antigen overload, and vaccine side effects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo characterise Long COVID in a highly vaccinated population infected by Omicron.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022.

SettingCommunity

Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received &gt;= 3 vaccine doses.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence of  Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression.

Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p &lt; 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study.

Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns &gt;=2 months after the acute illness.

Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%).

The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with &gt;=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare.

The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence is increased after diagnosis of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear.

MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type.

FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19.

InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea.

Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population.

Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained.

No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia.

Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable.

We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the pandemics dynamics changed, many municipalities lifted face wearing requirement in school which was initially implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission within Massachusetts school districts. We first replicated previous research by Cowger et al. (2022) utilizing a Difference-in-Difference (DID) model. Then, we back project the case infection and calculate the Rt value to redo the DID analysis. However, when shifting the outcome measurement to the reproductive number (Rt), our findings suggest that lifting mask mandates can only significantly influence the Rt first two weeks post-intervention. This implies that while mask mandate plays a role in mitigation, its lifting does not drastically influence COVID-19 transmissibility in the long term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors.

MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex.

ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [&amp;le;]60 years, [&amp;ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone.

ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

        <p class="abstract">Observational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR). We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD. Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA. In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recent global outbreak of Monkeypox, caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPVX) emerged in Europe in 2022 and rapidly spread to over 40 countries. The Americas are currently facing the highest impact, reporting over 50,000 cases by early 2023. Here, we analyze 880 MPXV isolates worldwide to gain insights into the evolutionary patterns and initial introduction events of the virus in Mexico. We found that MPXV entered Mexico on multiple occasions, from the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Canada, and subsequently spread locally in different regions of Mexico. Additionally, we show that MPXV has an open pangenome, highlighting the role of gene turnover in shaping its genomic diversity, rather than SNPs variations, which do not contribute significantly to genome diversity. Although the genome presents multiple SNP sites in coding regions, these remain under purifying selection, suggesting their evolutionary conservation. One notable exception is the amino acid site 63 of the protein encoded by the Cop-A4L gene, intricately related to viral maturity, for which we picked up a strong signal of positive selection. Ancestral state reconstruction deduced that the ancestral state at site 63 corresponds to the amino acid valine, present only in isolates of clade I. However, the isolates of the current outbreak evolved for threonine at site 63. Finally, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the evolutionary processes of the Monkeypox virus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundParkinsons Disease (PD) has a complex etiology, involving genetic and environmental factors. Most of our current understanding of the disease comes from studies in populations with mostly European ancestry, representing challenges in generalizing findings to other populations with different genetic, social, and environmental contexts. There are scarce studies focused in Latin American populations. The Mexican population is genetically diverse because its admixture from Native American, European, and African ancestries, coupled with the unique environmental conditions, stressing the relevance of establishing genetic studies in this population. Thus, we have established the Mexican Parkinsons Research Network (MEX-PD), a consortium to research the clinical, genetical, environmental, and neurophysiological bases of the phenotypic diversity in Mexican PD patients.

ObjectivesDescribing how MEX-PD was established, the methods and instruments and presenting the first results.

MethodsPatients and controls were recruited from medical centers in 20 states of Mexico. Initial recruitment included neurological evaluation, cognitive assessment, and DNA collection.

ResultsMEX-PD has registered 302 controls and 262 PD patients with a mean age of diagnosis of 61 years (SD=10.86). There were 19.8% PD patients identified with early onset. Levodopa was the most common pharmacological treatment.

ConclusionsMEX-PD contributes to understand PD nationally. The information gathered here will allow us to understand the prevalence of mental health, neurological symptoms, and cognitive function in the PD Mexican population and how genetical and environmental factors contributes to those outcomes. These will advocate for personalized treatments and improving quality of life in the Mexican population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among individuals aged 18 years and older

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingsPopulation-based study was conducted within the Arizona State University (ASU) community.

ParticipantsThe study recruited 1,397 adult participants that volunteered over a period of three days (March 1-March 3 of 2022).

Primary outcome measuresSeroprevalence was conducted in the community to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies resulting from previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or vaccination.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies was found to be 96.3% using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay and 98% using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. For anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies, the seroprevalence was 39.1% by an ELISA assay and 41.4% by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Individuals that experienced breakthrough infections exhibited the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies. Additionally, saliva samples showed promise as a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels, as they exhibited a strong correlation with the data obtained from serum samples.

ConclusionAccurate estimation of population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV- 2 will monitor the trend of infection in the community and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during and after outbreaks is crucial for informing the development of effective risk mitigation protocols within the community. Protocols may include measures such as encouraging booster shots, extending mask mandates, or transitioning to online classes. Serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in communities and prompt response to future outbreaks.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe simultaneously investigated active infection and seroprevalence for the university population.
C_LIO_LIOur study was strengthened by having the participants self-report data independently validated with diagnostic tests.
C_LIO_LISaliva samples could be a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels.
C_LIO_LIOur study was performed within the university setting therefore it only reflects the COVID-19 situation within that community.
C_LIO_LIThe number of breakthrough infections and the longitudinal samples were small, thus requiring confirmation.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInfluenza A viruses (IAV) are significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Although endemic in humans and birds, novel IAV strains can emerge, jump species, and cause epidemics, like the latest variant of H5N1. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has very recently been shown to detect human IAV but whether it can detect avian-origin IAV, and if whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be used to discriminate circulating strains of IAV in wastewater remains unknown.

MethodsUsing a pan-IAV RT-qPCR assay, six wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) across Northern Ireland (NI), were screened from August to December 2022. A WGS approach using Oxford Nanopore technology was employed to sequence positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences relative to currently circulating human and avian IAVs was performed.

FindingsWe detected a dynamic IAV signal in wastewater from September 2022 onwards across NI. &#34;Meta&#34; whole genome sequences were generated displaying homology to both human and avian IAV strains. The relative proportion of human versus avian-origin IAV reads differed across time and sample site. A diversity in subtypes and lineages was detected (e.g. H1N1, H3N2, and several avian). Avian segment 8 related to those found in recent H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was identified.

InterpretationWBE affords a means to monitor circulating human and avian IAV strains and provide crucial genetic information. As such WBE can provide rapid, cost-effective, year-round &#34;one-health&#34; IAV surveillance to help control epidemic and pandemic threats.

FundingThis study was funded by the Department of Health for Northern Ireland as part of the Northern Ireland Wastewater Surveillance Programme.

Author SummaryInfluenza A virus (IAV) is a major pathogen of humans and other animals and causes regular epidemics and devastating pandemics. Recently, a novel variant of highly-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has emerged spreading across the world killing millions of birds and infecting mammals, enhancing its pandemic potential. Strengthening global surveillance systems for human and animal IAV is thus a major priority. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been applied to track SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in humans but whether this approach could work for avian IAV is not known. Here, we develop a &#34;one-health&#34; method to survey pan-IAV levels and genetically characterise the viruses. Through this we highlight co-detection of human and avian IAVs in wastewater, with homology to recent H5N1 isolates. Our work demonstrates the potential for WBE to help defend against not only human infections but emerging, zoonotic IAVs of pandemic potential.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe major challenges of vaccination programs are notably coverage in the target population, vaccine hesitancy, and cost-effectiveness. A vaccination strategy with fractional doses is a dose-saving strategy to address current vaccine shortages. Herein, we aimed to review the literature on administering fractional vaccine doses in Africa.

MethodsA methodical search of PubMed was conducted to identify articles published up till March 31, 2023. Peer-reviewed studies were selected for inclusion if they focused on studies that described the use of fractional doses of vaccines and were conducted in any of the 54 African countries.

ResultsFindings from eleven eligible studies were analyzed. Studies were from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. They covered five vaccines including the yellow fever vaccine (n=3; 27.3%), inactivated poliovirus vaccine (n=3; 27.3%), meningococcal A/C/Y/W135 vaccine (n=2; 18.2%), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (n=2; 18.2%), and malaria vaccine (n=1; 9.1%). Fractionated doses used most often consist of one-fifth of the standard dose (n=8; 72.7%). Regarding immunogenicity/efficacity, eight of ten studies that addressed immunogenicity suggest that immune responses to the fractional dose vaccines were comparable to that of the standard dose vaccines and resulted in higher antibody titers. Regarding safety, all of the eight studies that addressed the safety of fractional doses in Africa, suggest that safety and tolerability data of fractional dosing were favorable compared to full dose regimen.

ConclusionFractional dosing may be considered to address the availability and acceptability of certain vaccines while maintaining protection. This strategy also has the potential advantage of reducing the cost of vaccination programs, vaccine antigen overload, and vaccine side effects.</p>
