Little is known about the relative severity of Omicron sub-lineages BA.2.75, BA.4.6 and BQ.1. We undertook a case-control analysis to determine the clinical severity of these lineages relative to BA.5, using whole genome sequenced, PCR-confirmed infections, between 1 August 2022 to 27 November 2022, among those who presented to emergency care in England 14 days after and up to one day prior to the positive specimen. A total of 10,375 episodes were included in the analysis, of which 5,207 (50.2%) were admitted to hospital or died. Multivariable conditional regression analyses found no evidence for greater odds of hospital admission or death among those with BA.2.75 (OR= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.09), and BA.4.6 (OR= 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.17) or BQ.1 (OR= 1.03, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 1.13) compared to BA.5. Future lineages may not follow the same trend and there remains a need for continued surveillance of COVID-19 variants and their clinical outcomes to inform the public health response.\nCommon infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia in three UK cohort studies\nAuthors: Green, R. E.; Sudre, C. H.; Warren-Gash, C.; Butt, J.; Waterboer, T.; The Insight 46 study team, ; Hughes, A. D.; Schott, J. M.; Richards, M.; Chaturvedi, N.; Williams, D. M.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292538\nIntroductionWe aimed to investigate associations between common infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia risk (brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter lesions) across three population-based studies. MethodsWe tested associations between serology measures (pathogen serostatus, cumulative burden, continuous antibody responses) and outcomes using linear regression, including adjustments for total intracranial volume and scanner/clinic information (basic model), age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position, alcohol, BMI, and smoking (fully adjusted model). Interactions between serology measures and APOE genotype were tested. Findings were meta-analysed across cohorts (Nmain=2632; NAPOE-interaction=1810). ResultsSeropositivity to JC virus associated with smaller brain volumes in basic models ({beta}=-3.89ml[-5.81,-1.97],padjusted\u003c0.05); these were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models ({beta}=-1.59ml[-3.55,0.36], p=0.11). No other relationships were robust to multiple testing correction and sensitivity analyses, but several suggestive associations were observed. DiscussionWe did not find clear evidence for relationships between common infections and markers of dementia risk. Some suggestive findings warrant testing for replication.\nImmune boosting bridges leaky and polarized vaccination models\nAuthors: Park, S. W.; Li, M.; Metcalf, J.; Grenfell, B.; Dushoff, J.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292670\nTwo different epidemiological models of vaccination are commonly used in dynamical modeling studies. The leaky vaccination model assumes that all vaccinated individuals experience a reduced force of infection by the same amount. The polarized vaccination model assumes that some fraction of vaccinated individuals are completely protected, while the remaining fraction remains completely susceptible; this seemingly extreme assumption causes the polarized model to always predict lower final epidemic size than the leaky model under the same vaccine efficacy. However, the leaky model also makes an implicit, unrealistic assumption: vaccinated individuals who are exposed to infection but not infected remain just as susceptible as they were prior to exposures (i.e., independent of previous exposures). To resolve the independence assumption, we introduce an immune boosting mechanism, through which vaccinated, yet susceptible, individuals can gain protection without developing a transmissible infection. The boosting model further predicts identical epidemic dynamics as the polarized vaccination model, thereby bridging the differences between two models. We further develop a generalized vaccination model to explore how the assumptions of immunity affect epidemic dynamics and estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Significance statementDifferent assumptions about the long- and medium-term effects of protective vaccination can predict sharply different epidemiological dynamics. However, there has been limited discussion about which assumptions are more realistic and therefore more appropriate for making public health decisions. Here, we show that the differences between the two most common assumptions (the \"leaky\" and \"polarized\" vaccination models) are bridged by immune boosting, a mechanism by which individuals who resist infectious challenge due to partial immunity have their immunity increased. We demonstrate that this mechanism has important implications for measuring vaccine effectiveness. Our study challenges fundamental assumptions about commonly used vaccination models and provides a novel framework for understanding the epidemiological impact of vaccination.\nThe historical fingerprint and future impact of climate change on childhood malaria in Africa\nAuthors: Carlson, C. J.; Carleton, T. A.; Odoulami, R.; Trisos, C. H.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292713\nThe health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure 1-3. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys 4 to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2{degrees}C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to[~] 3{degrees}C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa,per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.\nEvaluation of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admission related to common infections\nAuthors: Fahmi, A.; Palin, V.; Zhong, X.; Yang, Y.-T.; Watts, S.; Ashcroft, D. M.; Goldacre, B.; Mackenna, B.; Fisher, L.; Massey, J.; Mehrkar, A.; Bacon, S.; the OpenSAFELY collaborative, ; Hand, K.; van Staa, T.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292723\nBackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a multifaceted global challenge, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted antibiotic prescribing for common bacterial infections. This highlights the need to examine risk of hospital admissions related to common infections, excluding COVID-19 infections during the pandemic. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we accessed electronic health records from The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) through OpenSAFELY platform. We included patients with primary care diagnosis of common infections, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and lower urinary tract infection (UTI), from January 2019 to August 2022. We excluded patients with a COVID-19 record 90 days before to 30 days after the infection diagnosis. Using Cox proportional-hazard regression models, we predicted risk of infection-related hospital admission in 30 days follow-up period after the diagnosis. ResultsWe found 12,745,165 infection diagnoses from January 2019 to August 2022. Of them, 80,395 (2.05%) cases were admitted to hospital in the follow-up period. Counts of hospital admission for infections dropped during COVID-19, e.g., LRTI from 3,950 in December 2019 to 520 in April 2020. Comparing those prescribed an antibiotic to those without, reduction in risk of hospital admission were largest with LRTI (adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.35; 95% CI, 0.35-0.36) and UTI (adjusted OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.44-0.46), compared to URTI (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06). ConclusionLarge effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing complications related to LRTI and UTI can support better targeting of antibiotics to patients with higher complication risks. Key messages- The main drivers of infection-related hospital admission are age, Charlson comorbidity index, and history of prior antibiotics. - Antibiotics are more effective in preventing hospital admission related to infections such as lower respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, rather than upper respiratory tract infection. - Common antibiotic types are associated with more reduction in the risk of infection-related hospital admission.\nInterpretation of wide confidence intervals in meta-analytic estimates: Is the 'Absence of Evidence' 'Evidence of Absence'?\nAuthors: Miller, S. L.; Tuia, J.; Prasad, V.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.23292513\nIntroductionRecently, a Cochrane review by Jefferson et al. on physical interventions to slow the spread of respiratory viruses concluded that, \"Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 compared to not wearing masks\", though this finding had a wide confidence interval. Cochrane issued a rare clarifying statement, fueling controversy. We sought to contextualize the findings of the review by Jefferson et al. MethodsWe searched for consecutive reviews by Cochrane published on or before March 9th, 2023. We included studies where a central finding showed an intervention offered no statistically significant benefit, and ascertained the language used by reviewers to describe that result. We compare this to the report by Jefferson et al., and deemed it consistent or inconsistent with the language of their report. ResultsWe found between November 21st, 2022, and March 9th, 2023, there were 20 Cochrane reviews that met the inclusion criteria. We found that 95% (n = 19) of the reviews used language that was consistent with Jeffersons findings, while 5% (n = 1) used language inconsistent with Jeffersons conclusion, describing the effect of the intervention on the outcome as \"unclear\". DiscussionMost reviews performed by Cochrane conclude that interventions which fail to show statistically significant benefits make \"no difference\" have \"no effect\" or do not \"increase or decrease\" the outcome, and this occurs despite wide confidence intervals. The conclusions by Jefferson et al. are consistent with Cochrane reporting guidelines and clarification from the organization was unjustified.\nCausal association of COVID-19 with brain structure changes: Findings from a non-overlapping 2-sample Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Ding, P.; Xu, R.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292735\nRecent cohort studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in brain structure. However, the potential causal relationship remains unclear. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to determine whether genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical areas of the brain. This 2-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) study is an instrumental variable analysis of data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) meta-analyses round 5 excluding UK Biobank participants (COVID-19 infection, N=1,348,701; COVID-19 severity, N=1,557,411), the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) Global and regional cortical measures, N=33,709; combined hemispheric subcortical volumes, N=38,851), and UK Biobank (left/right subcortical volumes, N=19,629). A replication analysis was performed on summary statistics from different COVID-19 GWAS study (COVID-19 infection, N=80,932; COVID-19 severity, N=72,733). We found that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 was not significantly associated with changes in brain structures, including cortical and subcortical brain structure. Similar results were observed for different (1) MR estimates, (2) COVID-19 GWAS summary statistics, and (3) definitions of COVID-19 infection and severity. This study suggests that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is not causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical brain structure.\nEpidemiological and health economic implications of symptom propagation in respiratory pathogens: A mathematical modelling investigation\nAuthors: Asplin, P.; Keeling, M. J.; Mancy, R.; Hill, E. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292544\nBackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied. Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB). In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation. ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.\nMarburg Virus Disease outbreaks, mathematical models, and disease parameters: a Systematic Review\nAuthors: Cuomo-Dannenburg, G.; McCain, K.; McCabe, R.; Unwin, H. J. T.; Doohan, P.; Nash, R. K.; Hicks, J. T.; Charniga, K.; Geismar, C.; Lambert, B.; Nikitin, D.; Skarp, J. E.; Wardle, J.; Pathogen Epidemiology Review Group, ; Kont, M.; Bhatia, S.; Imai, N.; van Elsland, S. L.; Cori, A.; Morgenstern, C.\nScore: 17.2, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292424\nBackgroundRecent Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania highlighted the importance of better understanding this highly lethal infectious pathogen. Past epidemics of Ebola, COVID-19, and other pathogens have re-emphasised the usefulness of mathematical models in guiding public health responses during outbreaks. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023393345) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed papers reporting historical out-breaks, modelling studies and epidemiological parameters focused on MVD, including contextual information. We searched PubMed and Web of Science until 31st March 2023. Two reviewers evaluated all titles and abstracts, with consensus-based decision-making. To ensure agreement, 31% (13/42) of studies were double-extracted and a custom-designed quality assessment questionnaire was used to assess the risk of bias. FindingsWe present detailed outbreak, model and parameter information on 970 reported cases and 818 deaths from MVD until 31 March 2023. Analysis of historical outbreaks and sero-prevalence estimates suggests the possibility of undetected MVD outbreaks, asymptomatic transmission and/or cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates. InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available. FundingMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown. C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary. C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

Monitoring the fine-scale heterogeneity of the malaria burden enables more targeted control efforts. Although malaria indicator surveys (MIS) have been crucial in evaluating the progress of malaria control interventions, they are only designed to provide a cross-sectional national and regional malaria disease burden. Recent advances in geostatistical methods allow us to interpolate national survey data to describe subnational disease burden that is crucial in informing targeted control. A binomial geostatistical model employing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation methods is used to understand the spatial drivers of malaria risk in Kenya and to predict malaria risk at a fine-scale resolution, including identifying hotspots. A total of 11,549 children aged six months to 14 years from 207 clusters were sampled in this survey and used in the present analysis. The national malaria prevalence based on the data was 8.4%, with the highest in the lake endemic zone (18.1 %) and the lowest in the low-risk zone (\u003c1 %). The analysis shows that elevation, proportion of ITN distributed, rainfall, temperature and urbanization covariates are all significant predictors of malaria transmission. The 5x5 Km resolution maps show that malaria is heterogeneous in Kenya, with hotspot areas in the lake endemic area, the coastal areas, and some parts of the shores of Lake Turkana and Kajiado. The high-resolution malaria prevalence maps produced as part of the analysis have shown that Kenya has additional malaria hotspots, especially in areas least expected. These findings call for a rethinking of malaria burden classification in some regions for effective planning, implementation, resource mobilization, monitoring, and evaluation of malaria interventions in the country.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Since the emergence of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2021, a number of sub-lineages have arisen and circulated internationally. Little is known about the relative severity of Omicron sub-lineages BA.2.75, BA.4.6 and BQ.1. We undertook a case-control analysis to determine the clinical severity of these lineages relative to BA.5, using whole genome sequenced, PCR-confirmed infections, between 1 August 2022 to 27 November 2022, among those who presented to emergency care in England 14 days after and up to one day prior to the positive specimen. A total of 10,375 episodes were included in the analysis, of which 5,207 (50.2%) were admitted to hospital or died. Multivariable conditional regression analyses found no evidence for greater odds of hospital admission or death among those with BA.2.75 (OR= 0.96, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.09), and BA.4.6 (OR= 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.17) or BQ.1 (OR= 1.03, 95 % CI: 0.94 to 1.13) compared to BA.5. Future lineages may not follow the same trend and there remains a need for continued surveillance of COVID-19 variants and their clinical outcomes to inform the public health response.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWe aimed to investigate associations between common infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia risk (brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter lesions) across three population-based studies.

MethodsWe tested associations between serology measures (pathogen serostatus, cumulative burden, continuous antibody responses) and outcomes using linear regression, including adjustments for total intracranial volume and scanner/clinic information (basic model), age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position, alcohol, BMI, and smoking (fully adjusted model). Interactions between serology measures and APOE genotype were tested. Findings were meta-analysed across cohorts (Nmain=2632; NAPOE-interaction=1810).

ResultsSeropositivity to JC virus associated with smaller brain volumes in basic models ({beta}=-3.89ml[-5.81,-1.97],padjusted&lt;0.05); these were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models ({beta}=-1.59ml[-3.55,0.36], p=0.11). No other relationships were robust to multiple testing correction and sensitivity analyses, but several suggestive associations were observed.

DiscussionWe did not find clear evidence for relationships between common infections and markers of dementia risk. Some suggestive findings warrant testing for replication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Two different epidemiological models of vaccination are commonly used in dynamical modeling studies. The leaky vaccination model assumes that all vaccinated individuals experience a reduced force of infection by the same amount. The polarized vaccination model assumes that some fraction of vaccinated individuals are completely protected, while the remaining fraction remains completely susceptible; this seemingly extreme assumption causes the polarized model to always predict lower final epidemic size than the leaky model under the same vaccine efficacy. However, the leaky model also makes an implicit, unrealistic assumption: vaccinated individuals who are exposed to infection but not infected remain just as susceptible as they were prior to exposures (i.e., independent of previous exposures). To resolve the independence assumption, we introduce an immune boosting mechanism, through which vaccinated, yet susceptible, individuals can gain protection without developing a transmissible infection. The boosting model further predicts identical epidemic dynamics as the polarized vaccination model, thereby bridging the differences between two models. We further develop a generalized vaccination model to explore how the assumptions of immunity affect epidemic dynamics and estimates of vaccine effectiveness.

Significance statementDifferent assumptions about the long- and medium-term effects of protective vaccination can predict sharply different epidemiological dynamics. However, there has been limited discussion about which assumptions are more realistic and therefore more appropriate for making public health decisions. Here, we show that the differences between the two most common assumptions (the &#34;leaky&#34; and &#34;polarized&#34; vaccination models) are bridged by immune boosting, a mechanism by which individuals who resist infectious challenge due to partial immunity have their immunity increased. We demonstrate that this mechanism has important implications for measuring vaccine effectiveness. Our study challenges fundamental assumptions about commonly used vaccination models and provides a novel framework for understanding the epidemiological impact of vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure 1-3. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys 4 to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2{degrees}C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to[~] 3{degrees}C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa,per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a multifaceted global challenge, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted antibiotic prescribing for common bacterial infections. This highlights the need to examine risk of hospital admissions related to common infections, excluding COVID-19 infections during the pandemic.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we accessed electronic health records from The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) through OpenSAFELY platform. We included patients with primary care diagnosis of common infections, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and lower urinary tract infection (UTI), from January 2019 to August 2022. We excluded patients with a COVID-19 record 90 days before to 30 days after the infection diagnosis. Using Cox proportional-hazard regression models, we predicted risk of infection-related hospital admission in 30 days follow-up period after the diagnosis.

ResultsWe found 12,745,165 infection diagnoses from January 2019 to August 2022. Of them, 80,395 (2.05%) cases were admitted to hospital in the follow-up period. Counts of hospital admission for infections dropped during COVID-19, e.g., LRTI from 3,950 in December 2019 to 520 in April 2020. Comparing those prescribed an antibiotic to those without, reduction in risk of hospital admission were largest with LRTI (adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.35; 95% CI, 0.35-0.36) and UTI (adjusted OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.44-0.46), compared to URTI (adjusted OR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06).

ConclusionLarge effectiveness of antibiotics in preventing complications related to LRTI and UTI can support better targeting of antibiotics to patients with higher complication risks.

Key messages- The main drivers of infection-related hospital admission are age, Charlson comorbidity index, and history of prior antibiotics.
- Antibiotics are more effective in preventing hospital admission related to infections such as lower respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, rather than upper respiratory tract infection.
- Common antibiotic types are associated with more reduction in the risk of infection-related hospital admission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRecently, a Cochrane review by Jefferson et al. on physical interventions to slow the spread of respiratory viruses concluded that, &#34;Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2 compared to not wearing masks&#34;, though this finding had a wide confidence interval. Cochrane issued a rare clarifying statement, fueling controversy. We sought to contextualize the findings of the review by Jefferson et al.

MethodsWe searched for consecutive reviews by Cochrane published on or before March 9th, 2023. We included studies where a central finding showed an intervention offered no statistically significant benefit, and ascertained the language used by reviewers to describe that result. We compare this to the report by Jefferson et al., and deemed it consistent or inconsistent with the language of their report.

ResultsWe found between November 21st, 2022, and March 9th, 2023, there were 20 Cochrane reviews that met the inclusion criteria. We found that 95% (n = 19) of the reviews used language that was consistent with Jeffersons findings, while 5% (n = 1) used language inconsistent with Jeffersons conclusion, describing the effect of the intervention on the outcome as &#34;unclear&#34;.

DiscussionMost reviews performed by Cochrane conclude that interventions which fail to show statistically significant benefits make &#34;no difference&#34; have &#34;no effect&#34; or do not &#34;increase or decrease&#34; the outcome, and this occurs despite wide confidence intervals. The conclusions by Jefferson et al. are consistent with Cochrane reporting guidelines and clarification from the organization was unjustified.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent cohort studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in brain structure. However, the potential causal relationship remains unclear. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to determine whether genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical areas of the brain. This 2-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) study is an instrumental variable analysis of data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) meta-analyses round 5 excluding UK Biobank participants (COVID-19 infection, N=1,348,701; COVID-19 severity, N=1,557,411), the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) Global and regional cortical measures, N=33,709; combined hemispheric subcortical volumes, N=38,851), and UK Biobank (left/right subcortical volumes, N=19,629). A replication analysis was performed on summary statistics from different COVID-19 GWAS study (COVID-19 infection, N=80,932; COVID-19 severity, N=72,733). We found that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 was not significantly associated with changes in brain structures, including cortical and subcortical brain structure. Similar results were observed for different (1) MR estimates, (2) COVID-19 GWAS summary statistics, and (3) definitions of COVID-19 infection and severity. This study suggests that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is not causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical brain structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.

Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying  tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB).

In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.

ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRecent Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania highlighted the importance of better understanding this highly lethal infectious pathogen. Past epidemics of Ebola, COVID-19, and other pathogens have re-emphasised the usefulness of mathematical models in guiding public health responses during outbreaks.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023393345) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed papers reporting historical out-breaks, modelling studies and epidemiological parameters focused on MVD, including contextual information. We searched PubMed and Web of Science until 31st March 2023. Two reviewers evaluated all titles and abstracts, with consensus-based decision-making. To ensure agreement, 31% (13/42) of studies were double-extracted and a custom-designed quality assessment questionnaire was used to assess the risk of bias.

FindingsWe present detailed outbreak, model and parameter information on 970 reported cases and 818 deaths from MVD until 31 March 2023. Analysis of historical outbreaks and sero-prevalence estimates suggests the possibility of undetected MVD outbreaks, asymptomatic transmission and/or cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates.

InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available.

Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study
We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown.
C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study
We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary.
C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence
Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

        <p class="abstract">Malaria remains a public health concern. Monitoring the fine-scale heterogeneity of the malaria burden enables more targeted control efforts. Although malaria indicator surveys (MIS) have been crucial in evaluating the progress of malaria control interventions, they are only designed to provide a cross-sectional national and regional malaria disease burden. Recent advances in geostatistical methods allow us to interpolate national survey data to describe subnational disease burden that is crucial in informing targeted control.

A binomial geostatistical model employing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation methods is used to understand the spatial drivers of malaria risk in Kenya and to predict malaria risk at a fine-scale resolution, including identifying hotspots.

A total of 11,549 children aged six months to 14 years from 207 clusters were sampled in this survey and used in the present analysis. The national malaria prevalence based on the data was 8.4%, with the highest in the lake endemic zone (18.1 %) and the lowest in the low-risk zone (&lt;1 %). The analysis shows that elevation, proportion of ITN distributed, rainfall, temperature and urbanization covariates are all significant predictors of malaria transmission. The 5x5 Km resolution maps show that malaria is heterogeneous in Kenya, with hotspot areas in the lake endemic area, the coastal areas, and some parts of the shores of Lake Turkana and Kajiado.

The high-resolution malaria prevalence maps produced as part of the analysis have shown that Kenya has additional malaria hotspots, especially in areas least expected. These findings call for a rethinking of malaria burden classification in some regions for effective planning, implementation, resource mobilization, monitoring, and evaluation of malaria interventions in the country.</p>
