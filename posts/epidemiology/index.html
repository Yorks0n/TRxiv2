E.; Wardle, J.; Pathogen Epidemiology Review Group, ; Kont, M.; Bhatia, S.; Imai, N.; van Elsland, S. L.; Cori, A.; Morgenstern, C.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292424\nBackgroundRecent Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania highlighted the importance of better understanding this highly lethal infectious pathogen. Past epidemics of Ebola, COVID-19, and other pathogens have re-emphasised the usefulness of mathematical models in guiding public health responses during outbreaks. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023393345) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed papers reporting historical out-breaks, modelling studies and epidemiological parameters focused on MVD, including contextual information. We searched PubMed and Web of Science until 31st March 2023. Two reviewers evaluated all titles and abstracts, with consensus-based decision-making. To ensure agreement, 31% (13/42) of studies were double-extracted and a custom-designed quality assessment questionnaire was used to assess the risk of bias. FindingsWe present detailed outbreak, model and parameter information on 970 reported cases and 818 deaths from MVD until 31 March 2023. Analysis of historical outbreaks and sero-prevalence estimates suggests the possibility of undetected MVD outbreaks, asymptomatic transmission and/or cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates. InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available. FundingMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown. C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary. C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

H.; Warren-Gash, C.; Butt, J.; Waterboer, T.; The Insight 46 study team, ; Hughes, A. D.; Schott, J. M.; Richards, M.; Chaturvedi, N.; Williams, D. M.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292538\nIntroductionWe aimed to investigate associations between common infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia risk (brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter lesions) across three population-based studies. MethodsWe tested associations between serology measures (pathogen serostatus, cumulative burden, continuous antibody responses) and outcomes using linear regression, including adjustments for total intracranial volume and scanner/clinic information (basic model), age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position, alcohol, BMI, and smoking (fully adjusted model). Interactions between serology measures and APOE genotype were tested. Findings were meta-analysed across cohorts (Nmain=2632; NAPOE-interaction=1810). ResultsSeropositivity to JC virus associated with smaller brain volumes in basic models ({beta}=-3.89ml[-5.81,-1.97],padjusted\u003c0.05); these were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models ({beta}=-1.59ml[-3.55,0.36], p=0.11). No other relationships were robust to multiple testing correction and sensitivity analyses, but several suggestive associations were observed. DiscussionWe did not find clear evidence for relationships between common infections and markers of dementia risk. Some suggestive findings warrant testing for replication.\nThe historical fingerprint and future impact of climate change on childhood malaria in Africa\nAuthors: Carlson, C. J.; Carleton, T. A.; Odoulami, R.; Trisos, C. H.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292713\nThe health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2 degrees C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to ~3 degrees C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa, per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.\nEstimating disease heritability from complex pedigrees allowing for ascertainment and covariates\nAuthors: Speed, D.; Evans, D. M.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.23292588\nWe propose TetraHer, a method for estimating the liability heritability of binary phenotypes. TetraHer has five key features. Firstly, it can be applied to data from complex pedigrees, that contain multiple types of relationships. Secondly, it can correct for ascertainment of cases or controls. Thirdly, it can accommodate covariates. Fourthly, it can model the contribution of common environment. Fifthly, it produces a likelihood, that can be used for significance testing. We first demonstrate the validity of TetraHer on simulated data. We then use TetraHer to estimate liability heritability for 229 codes from the tenth International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We identify 118 codes with significant heritability (P\u003c0.05/229), which can be used in future analyses for investigating the genetic architecture of human diseases.\nComparative Reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in three African countries using a mathematical model integrating immunity data.\nAuthors: neffeti, b.; kebir, a.; ben aribi, w.; Diarra, M.; schoenhals, m.; vigan-womas, i.; dellagi, k.; ben miled, s.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292215\nObjectivesAfrica has experienced fewer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths than other regions, with a contrasting epidemiological situation between countries, raising questions regarding the determinants of disease spread in Africa. MethodWe built a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model including COVID-19 mortality data where recovery class is structured by specific immunization and modeled by a partial differential equation considering the opposed effects of immunity decline and immunization. This model was applied to Tunisia, Senegal, and Madagascar. FindingSenegal and Tunisia experienced two epidemic phases. Initially, infections emerged in naive individuals and were limited by social distancing. Variants of concern (VOCs) were also introduced. The second phase was characterized by successive epidemic waves driven by new VOCs that escaped host immunity. Meanwhile, Madagascar demonstrated a different profile, characterized by longer intervals between epidemic waves, increasing the pool of susceptible individuals who had lost their protective immunity. The impact of vaccination in Tunisia and Senegal on model parameters was evaluated. InterpretationLoss of immunity and vaccination-induced immunity have played crucial role in controlling the African pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become endemic now and will continue to circulate in African populations. However, previous infections provide significant protection against severe diseases, thus providing a basis for future vaccination strategies.\nCausal association of COVID-19 with brain structure changes: Findings from a non-overlapping 2-sample Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Ding, P.; Xu, R.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.23292735\nRecent cohort studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in brain structure. However, the potential causal relationship remains unclear. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to determine whether genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical areas of the brain. This 2-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) study is an instrumental variable analysis of data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) meta-analyses round 5 excluding UK Biobank participants (COVID-19 infection, N=1,348,701; COVID-19 severity, N=1,557,411), the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) Global and regional cortical measures, N=33,709; combined hemispheric subcortical volumes, N=38,851), and UK Biobank (left/right subcortical volumes, N=19,629). A replication analysis was performed on summary statistics from different COVID-19 GWAS study (COVID-19 infection, N=80,932; COVID-19 severity, N=72,733). We found that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 was not significantly associated with changes in brain structures, including cortical and subcortical brain structure. Similar results were observed for different (1) MR estimates, (2) COVID-19 GWAS summary statistics, and (3) definitions of COVID-19 infection and severity. This study suggests that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is not causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical brain structure.\nEpidemiological and health economic implications of symptom propagation in respiratory pathogens: A mathematical modelling investigation\nAuthors: Asplin, P.; Keeling, M. J.; Mancy, R.; Hill, E. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.12.23292544\nBackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied. Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB). In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation. ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.\nAssociation of Domains of Sedentary Behavior with Cardiovascular Disease Events in The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis\nAuthors: Mayo, N. L.; Lopez, D. A.; Block, R. C.; Shi, H.; Bertoni, A. G.; Diaz, K. M.; Ding, J.; Post, W. S.; Liu, Y.; Li, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291977\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. Little is known about this relationship in an ethnically diverse population. The objective of our study is to assess the effects of leisure time and occupational sedentary behavior on multiple cardiovascular outcomes in a multi-ethnic cohort. MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) includes 2619 Caucasian, 1495 Hispanic, 1891 Black, and 804 Chinese-American adults aged 45-84 years and free of clinical CVD at enrollment, Sedentary behavior was self-reported at baseline. Participants were followed for an average of 13.6 years, and 14 types of cardiovascular outcomes were ascertained. Hazards of each cardiovascular outcome were modeled with adjustment for potential confounders, including physical activity. ResultsEvery one hour per day increase in leisure time sedentary behavior predicts a 6% increase in the adjusted hazards for CVD death (P \u003c 0.05). Every one hour increase in occupational sedentary time predicts a 21% and 20% decrease in the hazard for PVD and other revascularization, respectively (P \u003c 0.05). ConclusionsLeisure time sedentary behavior was associated with increased hazards for CVD death, but occupational sedentary time appears to be protective of peripheral vascular disease and other revascularization. Condensed AbstractSedentary behavior has been consistently associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) consists of a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of adults age 45-84, free from CVD at baseline. Greater levels of leisure time sedentary behavior predicted increased hazards for PVD and CVD death after an average follow up of 13.6 years whereas occupational sedentary behaviors predicted reduced PVD. These results underscore the importance of reducing time spent sitting in addition to advocating for meeting physical activity targets across ethnicities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRecent Marburg virus disease (MVD) outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania highlighted the importance of better understanding this highly lethal infectious pathogen. Past epidemics of Ebola, COVID-19, and other pathogens have re-emphasised the usefulness of mathematical models in guiding public health responses during outbreaks.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023393345) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, of peer-reviewed papers reporting historical out-breaks, modelling studies and epidemiological parameters focused on MVD, including contextual information. We searched PubMed and Web of Science until 31st March 2023. Two reviewers evaluated all titles and abstracts, with consensus-based decision-making. To ensure agreement, 31% (13/42) of studies were double-extracted and a custom-designed quality assessment questionnaire was used to assess the risk of bias.

FindingsWe present detailed outbreak, model and parameter information on 970 reported cases and 818 deaths from MVD until 31 March 2023. Analysis of historical outbreaks and sero-prevalence estimates suggests the possibility of undetected MVD outbreaks, asymptomatic transmission and/or cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Only one study presented a mathematical model of MVD transmission. We estimate an unadjusted, pooled total random effect case fatality ratio for MVD of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We identify key epidemiological parameters relating to transmission and natural history for which there are few estimates.

InterpretationThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology of MVD, identifying key knowledge gaps about this pathogen. The extensive collection of knowledge gathered here will be crucial in developing mathematical models for use in the early stages of future outbreaks of MVD. All data are published alongside this article with functionality to easily update the database as new data become available.

Research in ContextO_LIEvidence before this study
We searched Web of Science and PubMed up to 31 March 2023 using the search terms Marburg virus, epidemiology, outbreaks, models, transmissibility, severity, delays, risk factors, mutation rates and seroprevalence. We found five systematic reviews, all of which considered MVD alongside Ebola virus disease (EVD). One modelling study of Marburg virus disease (MVD) focused on animals, and not on computational models to understand past or project future disease transmission. One systematic review collated risk factors for transmission based on four MVD studies, but did not report attack rates due to missing underlying MVD estimates; another systematic review pooled estimates of MVD case fatality ratios (CFR): 53.8% (95% CI: 26.5-80.0%) and seroprevalence: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.0%). No systematic review covered transmission models of MVD, and the impact of public health and social measures is unknown.
C_LIO_LIAdded value of this study
We provide a comprehensive summary of the available, peer-reviewed literature of historical outbreaks, transmission models and parameters for MVD. Meta-analysis of existing estimates of CFRs, and our original estimates based on historical outbreak information, illustrate the severity of MVD with our pooled random effect estimated CFR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.8-80.6%, I2=93%). We demonstrate the sparsity of evidence on MVD transmission and disease dynamics, particularly on transmissibility and natural history, which are key input parameters for computational models supporting outbreak response. Our work highlights key areas where further disease characterization is necessary.
C_LIO_LIImplications of all the available evidence
Previous outbreaks of infectious pathogens emphasized the usefulness of computational modelling in assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of mitigation strategies. Our study provides necessary information for using mathematical models in future outbreaks of MVD, identifies uncertainties and knowledge gaps in MVD transmission and natural history, and highlights the severity of MVD.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWe aimed to investigate associations between common infections and neuroimaging markers of dementia risk (brain volume, hippocampal volume, white matter lesions) across three population-based studies.

MethodsWe tested associations between serology measures (pathogen serostatus, cumulative burden, continuous antibody responses) and outcomes using linear regression, including adjustments for total intracranial volume and scanner/clinic information (basic model), age, sex, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position, alcohol, BMI, and smoking (fully adjusted model). Interactions between serology measures and APOE genotype were tested. Findings were meta-analysed across cohorts (Nmain=2632; NAPOE-interaction=1810).

ResultsSeropositivity to JC virus associated with smaller brain volumes in basic models ({beta}=-3.89ml[-5.81,-1.97],padjusted&lt;0.05); these were largely attenuated in fully adjusted models ({beta}=-1.59ml[-3.55,0.36], p=0.11). No other relationships were robust to multiple testing correction and sensitivity analyses, but several suggestive associations were observed.

DiscussionWe did not find clear evidence for relationships between common infections and markers of dementia risk. Some suggestive findings warrant testing for replication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2 degrees C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to ~3 degrees C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa, per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We propose TetraHer, a method for estimating the liability heritability of binary phenotypes. TetraHer has five key features. Firstly, it can be applied to data from complex pedigrees, that contain multiple types of relationships. Secondly, it can correct for ascertainment of cases or controls. Thirdly, it can accommodate covariates. Fourthly, it can model the contribution of common environment. Fifthly, it produces a likelihood, that can be used for significance testing. We first demonstrate the validity of TetraHer on simulated data. We then use TetraHer to estimate liability heritability for 229 codes from the tenth International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). We identify 118 codes with significant heritability (P&lt;0.05/229), which can be used in future analyses for investigating the genetic architecture of human diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesAfrica has experienced fewer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths than other regions, with a contrasting epidemiological situation between countries, raising questions regarding the determinants of disease spread in Africa.

MethodWe built a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model including COVID-19 mortality data where recovery class is structured by specific immunization and modeled by a partial differential equation considering the opposed effects of immunity decline and immunization. This model was applied to Tunisia, Senegal, and Madagascar.

FindingSenegal and Tunisia experienced two epidemic phases. Initially, infections emerged in naive individuals and were limited by social distancing. Variants of concern (VOCs) were also introduced. The second phase was characterized by successive epidemic waves driven by new VOCs that escaped host immunity. Meanwhile, Madagascar demonstrated a different profile, characterized by longer intervals between epidemic waves, increasing the pool of susceptible individuals who had lost their protective immunity. The impact of vaccination in Tunisia and Senegal on model parameters was evaluated.

InterpretationLoss of immunity and vaccination-induced immunity have played crucial role in controlling the African pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become endemic now and will continue to circulate in African populations. However, previous infections provide significant protection against severe diseases, thus providing a basis for future vaccination strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent cohort studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with changes in brain structure. However, the potential causal relationship remains unclear. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to determine whether genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical areas of the brain. This 2-sample MR (Mendelian Randomization) study is an instrumental variable analysis of data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) meta-analyses round 5 excluding UK Biobank participants (COVID-19 infection, N=1,348,701; COVID-19 severity, N=1,557,411), the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) Global and regional cortical measures, N=33,709; combined hemispheric subcortical volumes, N=38,851), and UK Biobank (left/right subcortical volumes, N=19,629). A replication analysis was performed on summary statistics from different COVID-19 GWAS study (COVID-19 infection, N=80,932; COVID-19 severity, N=72,733). We found that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 was not significantly associated with changes in brain structures, including cortical and subcortical brain structure. Similar results were observed for different (1) MR estimates, (2) COVID-19 GWAS summary statistics, and (3) definitions of COVID-19 infection and severity. This study suggests that the genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 is not causally associated with changes in cortical and subcortical brain structure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRespiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.

Methods and FindingsWe propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, . Varying  tunes the model from having no symptom propagation ( = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate ( = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens -- seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 -- we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB MB).

In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all levels of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.

ConclusionsOverall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. Little is known about this relationship in an ethnically diverse population. The objective of our study is to assess the effects of leisure time and occupational sedentary behavior on multiple cardiovascular outcomes in a multi-ethnic cohort.

MethodsThe Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) includes 2619 Caucasian, 1495 Hispanic, 1891 Black, and 804 Chinese-American adults aged 45-84 years and free of clinical CVD at enrollment, Sedentary behavior was self-reported at baseline. Participants were followed for an average of 13.6 years, and 14 types of cardiovascular outcomes were ascertained. Hazards of each cardiovascular outcome were modeled with adjustment for potential confounders, including physical activity.

ResultsEvery one hour per day increase in leisure time sedentary behavior predicts a 6% increase in the adjusted hazards for CVD death (P &lt; 0.05). Every one hour increase in occupational sedentary time predicts a 21% and 20% decrease in the hazard for PVD and other revascularization, respectively (P &lt; 0.05).

ConclusionsLeisure time sedentary behavior was associated with increased hazards for CVD death, but occupational sedentary time appears to be protective of peripheral vascular disease and other revascularization.

Condensed AbstractSedentary behavior has been consistently associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of physical activity status. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) consists of a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of adults age 45-84, free from CVD at baseline. Greater levels of leisure time sedentary behavior predicted increased hazards for PVD and CVD death after an average follow up of 13.6 years whereas occupational sedentary behaviors predicted reduced PVD. These results underscore the importance of reducing time spent sitting in addition to advocating for meeting physical activity targets across ethnicities.</p>
