M.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299364\nBackgroundLong COVID is the patient-coined term for the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 illness for weeks, months or years following the acute infection. There is a large burden of long COVID globally from self-reported data, but the epidemiology, causes and treatments remain poorly understood. Primary care is used to help identify and treat patients with long COVID and therefore Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of past COVID-19 patients could be used to help fill these knowledge gaps. We aimed to describe those with long COVID in primary care records in England. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England we used routine clinical data from over 19 million adults in England linked to SARS-COV-2 test result, hospitalisation and vaccination data to describe trends in the recording of 16 clinical codes related to long COVID between November 2020 and January 2023. We calculated rates per 100,000 person-years and plotted how these changed over time. We compared crude and minimally adjusted rates of recorded long COVID in patient records between different key demographic and vaccination characteristics using negative binomial models. FindingsWe identified a total of 55,465 people recorded to have long COVID over the study period, with incidence of new long COVID records increasing steadily over 2021, and declining over 2022. The overall rate per 100,000 person-years was 177.5 cases in women (95% CI: 175.5-179) and 100.5 men (99.5-102). In terms of vaccination against COVID-19, the lowest rates were observed in those with 3+ vaccine doses (103.5 [95% CI: 101.5-105]). Finally, the majority of those with a long COVID record did not have a recorded positive SARS-COV-2 test 12 weeks before the long COVID record. InterpretationEHR recorded long COVID remains very low compared and incident records of long COVID declined over 2022. We found the lowest rates of recorded long COVID in people with 3 or more vaccine doses. We summarised several sources of possible bias for researchers using EHRs to study long COVID.\nImpact of COVID-19 on mental illness in vaccinated and unvaccinated people: a population-based cohort study in OpenSAFELY\nAuthors: Walker, V.; Patalay, P.; Cuitin Coronado, J.

A.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299602\nBackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19. OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

F.; Schmidt, R. J.; Volk, H. E.; Nitta, M. M.; Feinberg, J. I.; Newschaffer, C. J.; Croen, L. A.; Hertz-Picciotto, I.; Fallin, M. D.; Bakulski, K. M.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298827\nBackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Risk is attributed to genetic and prenatal environmental factors, though the environmental agents are incompletely characterized. MethodsIn Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two pregnancy cohorts of siblings of children with ASD, maternal urinary metals concentrations at two time points during pregnancy were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At age three, clinicians assessed ASD with DSM-5 criteria. Using multivariable log binomial regression, we examined each metal for association with ASD status, adjusting for gestational age at urine sampling, child sex, maternal age, and maternal education, and meta-analyzed across the two cohorts. ResultsIn EARLI (n=170) 17.6% of children were diagnosed with ASD, and an additional 43.5% were classified as having other non-neurotypical development (Non-TD). In MARBLES (n=156), 22.7% were diagnosed with ASD, while an additional 11.5% had Non-TD. In earlier pregnancy metals measures, having cadmium concentration over the level of detection was associated with 1.78 (1.19, 2.67) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.43 (1.06, 1.92) times higher risk of Non-TD. A doubling of early pregnancy cesium concentration was marginally associated with 1.81 (0.95, 3.42) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.58 (0.95, 2.63) times higher risk of Non-TD. ConclusionExposure in utero to elevated levels of cadmium and cesium, as measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy, was associated with increased risk of developing ASD.\nA Data Science Pipeline Applied to Australia's 2022 COVID-19 Omicron Waves\nAuthors: Trauer, J. M.; Hughes, A. E.; Shipman, D. S.; Meehan, M. T.; Henderson, A. S.; McBryde, E. S.; Ragonnet, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299260\nThe field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed, with packages now available to support many stages of data science pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated this with several open-source libraries and applied this pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australias 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, but including the effect of 2022 vaccination programs on transmission did not. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30 to 60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online notebooks.\nTemporal contact patterns and the implications for predicting superspreaders and planning of targeted outbreak control\nAuthors: Pung, R.; Firth, J. A.; Russell, T.; Rogers, T.; Lee, V. J.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298919\nEpidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions. SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.\n",

We calculated rates per 100,000 person-years and plotted how these changed over time. We compared crude and minimally adjusted rates of recorded long COVID in patient records between different key demographic and vaccination characteristics using negative binomial models.

FindingsWe identified a total of 55,465 people recorded to have long COVID over the study period, with incidence of new long COVID records increasing steadily over 2021, and declining over 2022. The overall rate per 100,000 person-years was 177.5 cases in women (95% CI: 175.5-179) and 100.5 men (99.5-102). In terms of vaccination against COVID-19, the lowest rates were observed in those with 3&#43; vaccine doses (103.5 [95% CI: 101.5-105]). Finally, the majority of those with a long COVID record did not have a recorded positive SARS-COV-2 test 12 weeks before the long COVID record.

InterpretationEHR recorded long COVID remains very low compared and incident records of long COVID declined over 2022. We found the lowest rates of recorded long COVID in people with 3 or more vaccine doses. We summarised several sources of possible bias for researchers using EHRs to study long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a  pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and  vaccinated and  unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19.

OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19.

InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Risk is attributed to genetic and prenatal environmental factors, though the environmental agents are incompletely characterized.

MethodsIn Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two pregnancy cohorts of siblings of children with ASD, maternal urinary metals concentrations at two time points during pregnancy were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At age three, clinicians assessed ASD with DSM-5 criteria. Using multivariable log binomial regression, we examined each metal for association with ASD status, adjusting for gestational age at urine sampling, child sex, maternal age, and maternal education, and meta-analyzed across the two cohorts.

ResultsIn EARLI (n=170) 17.6% of children were diagnosed with ASD, and an additional 43.5% were classified as having other non-neurotypical development (Non-TD). In MARBLES (n=156), 22.7% were diagnosed with ASD, while an additional 11.5% had Non-TD. In earlier pregnancy metals measures, having cadmium concentration over the level of detection was associated with 1.78 (1.19, 2.67) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.43 (1.06, 1.92) times higher risk of Non-TD. A doubling of early pregnancy cesium concentration was marginally associated with 1.81 (0.95, 3.42) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.58 (0.95, 2.63) times higher risk of Non-TD.

ConclusionExposure in utero to elevated levels of cadmium and cesium, as measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy, was associated with increased risk of developing ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed, with packages now available to support many stages of data science pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the construction of infectious disease models, integrated this with several open-source libraries and applied this pipeline to multiple data sources that provided insights into Australias 2022 COVID-19 epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify relevant epidemiological parameters. Extending the base model to include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, but including the effect of 2022 vaccination programs on transmission did not. Our simulations suggested that one in every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging Omicron subvariants escaped 30 to 60% of recently acquired natural immunity and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months. We documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in conjunction with interactive online notebooks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions.

SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual  superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.</p>
