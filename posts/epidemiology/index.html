Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant. MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported. ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant). ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.\nVentilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\nAuthors: Zand, M. S.; Spallina, S.; Ross, A.; Zandi, K.; Pawlowski, A.; Seplaki, C.; Herington, J.; Corbett, A.; Kaukeinen, K.; Freedman, E.; Holden-Wiltse, J.; Alcantara, L.; Li, D.; Cameron, A.; Beaumont, N.; Dozier, A.; Dewhurst, S.; Foxe, J.\nScore: 41.6, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295268\nBackground: This study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2[\u0026ge;] 1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation. Methods: We established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results: 97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[\u0026le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[\u0026ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels[\u0026ge;] 1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations[\u0026ge;] 1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.\nLight at night and modeled circadian disruption predict higher risk of mortality: A prospective study in \u003e88,000 participants\nAuthors: Windred, D. P.; Burns, A. C.; Lane, J. M.; Olivier, P.; Rutter, M. K.; Saxena, R.; Phillips, A. J. K.; Cain, S. W.\nScore: 28.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295231\nImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingUnited Kingdom. ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 57% female. ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{+/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality? FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in \u003e88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk. MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on short-term cancer survival in the United Kingdom: a cohort analysis\nAuthors: Barclay, N. L.; Burkard, T.; Burn, E.; Delmestri, A.; Dominguez, A. M.; Golozar, A.; Guarner-Argente, C.; Aviles-Jurado, F.-X.; Man, W. Y.; Rosello Serrano, A.; Weinberger Rosen, A.; Tan, E. H.; Tietzova, I.; OPTIMA Consortium, ; PRIETO-ALHAMBRA, D.; Newby, D.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295563\nObjectives: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected healthcare systems and patients. There is a pressing need to comprehend the collateral effects of the pandemic on non-communicable diseases. Here we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on short-term cancer survival in the United Kingdom (UK). We hypothesised that short-term survival from nine cancers would be reduced during the pandemic, particularly cancers that benefit from screening and early detection (e.g., breast and colorectal cancer). Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Electronic health records from UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database. Participants: There were 12,259,744 eligible patients aged [\u0026ge;]18 years with [\u0026ge;]one year of prior history identified from January 2000 to December 2021. Main outcome measures: We estimated age-standardised incidence rates (IR) and short-term (one- and two-year) survival of several common cancers (breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, oesophagus, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer) from 2000 to 2019 (in five-year strata) compared to 2020 to 2021 using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Apart from pancreatic cancer, IRs decreased for all cancers in 2020 and recovered to different extents in 2021. Short-term survival improved for most cancers between 2000 to 2019, but then declined for those diagnosed in 2020 to 2021.This was most pronounced for colorectal cancer, with one-year survival falling from 79.3% [95% confidence interval: 78.5%-80.1%] in 2015 to 2019 to 76.3% [74.6%-78.1%] for those diagnosed in 2020 to 2021. Conclusion: Short-term survival for many cancers was impacted by the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. This decline was most prominent for colorectal cancer, with reductions in survivorship equivalent to returning to mortality seen in the first decade of the 2000s. These results illustrate the need for an immediate and well-funded investment in resolving the current backlog in cancer screening and diagnostic procedures in the UK National Health Service to improve patient outcomes.\nPrevalence of Long COVID-associated symptoms in adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany: Results of the population-based study: Corona Monitoring Nationwide 2021/22 (RKI-SOEP-2)\nAuthors: Poethko-Mueller, C.; Ordonez-Cruickshank, A.; Nuebel, J.; Sarganas, G.; Goesswald, A.; Schmid, L.; Schaffrath Rosario, A.; Hoebel, J.; Schlaud, M.; Scheidt-Nave, C.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295426\nBackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to \"Long COVID\" and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge. AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany. MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [\u0026ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection. Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p\u003c0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p\u003c0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p\u003c0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p\u003c0.001). [\u0026ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0). ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.\nInsomnia symptom prevalence in England: A comparison of self-reported data and primary care records in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: de Lange, M. A.; Richmond, R. C.; Eastwood, S. V.; Davies, N. M.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.23295191\nPurposeWe aimed to use a large dataset to compare self-reported and primary care measures of insomnia symptom prevalence in England and establish whether they identify participants with similar characteristics. MethodsWe analysed data from 163,748 UK Biobank participants in England (aged 38-71 at baseline) with linked primary care electronic health records. We compared the percentage of those self-reporting usually having insomnia symptoms at UK Biobank baseline assessment (2006-2010) to those with a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records prior to baseline. We stratified prevalence in both groups by sociodemographic, lifestyle, sleep and health characteristics. ResultsWe found that 29% of the sample self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. Only 10% of self-reported cases had an insomnia symptom Read code, whilst 49% of primary care cases self-reported having insomnia symptoms. In both primary care and self-reported data, prevalence of insomnia symptom cases was highest in females, older participants and those with the lowest household incomes. However, whilst snorers and risk takers were more likely to be a primary care case, they were less likely to self-report insomnia symptoms than non-snorers and non-risk takers. ConclusionsOnly a small proportion of individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms present to primary care. However, the sociodemographic characteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia were consistent with those with self-reported insomnia, thus primary care records are a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia. Key PointsO_LIAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on small samples and rely on people self-reporting their symptoms. C_LIO_LIElectronic health records (EHRs) offer a more objective means of measuring insomnia prevalence, but small-scale studies suggest they only capture a small proportion of insomnia cases. It is therefore unclear how useful EHRs are in measuring the prevalence of insomnia. C_LIO_LIIn a sample of over 160,000 UK Biobank participants in England we found that 29% of participants self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. C_LIO_LICharacteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia symptoms are similar to those self-reporting insomnia symptoms, suggesting EHRs offer a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia. C_LI Plain Language SummaryAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on the responses of a small number of people and rely on them reporting their own symptoms. Peoples medical records offer a more objective way of finding out how many people have insomnia, but only capture people who go to their doctor for help. In this study we compared 160,000 peoples answers to a question on insomnia symptoms to their primary care records. We found that 29% of people reported insomnia symptoms, whereas only 6% had insomnia symptoms recorded in their medical records. However, the characteristics of those reporting insomnia and those with insomnia in their medical records were similar. This means that although medical records only capture a small proportion of those suffering from insomnia, they do still provide useful information for researchers studying risk factors for insomnia.\nEstimation of the infection attack rate of mumps in an outbreak among college students using paired serology\nAuthors: van Boven, M.; Backer, J.; Veldhuijzen, I.; Gomme, J.; van Binnendijk, R.; Kaaijk, P.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295419\nMumps virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that is effectively controlled in countries with high vaccination coverage. Nevertheless, outbreaks have occurred worldwide over the past decades in vaccinated populations. Here we analyse serological data from outbreaks of mumps virus genotype G among college students in the Netherlands over the period 2009-2012. To identify infections in the presence of preexisting antibodies we compared mumps specific serum IgG concentrations in two consecutive samples (n = 746), whereby the first sample was taken when students started their study prior to the outbreaks, and the second sample was taken 2-5 years later. We fit a binary mixture model to the data. The two mixing distributions represent uninfected and infected classes. Throughout we assume that the infection probability increases with the ratio of antibody concentrations of the second to first sample. The estimated infection attack rate is higher than reported earlier (0.095 versus 0.042). The analyses yield probabilistic classifications of participants, which are mostly quite precise owing to the high intraclass correlation in uninfected participants (0.85, 95%CrI: 0.82 - 0.87). The estimated probability of infection increases with decreasing antibody concentration in the pre-outbreak sample, such that the probability of infection is 0.12 (95%CrI: 0.10 - 0.13) for the lowest quartile of the pre-outbreak samples and 0.056 (95%CrI: 0.044 - 0.068) for the highest quartile. We discuss the implications of these insights for the design of booster vaccination strategies. HighlightsO_LIWe use paired pre- and post-outbreak serological data to estimate mumps infection rates in college students. C_LIO_LIWe use a two-component mixture model to provide individual estimates of infection for each participant. C_LIO_LIThe estimated population infection attack rate is higher than reported earlier (9.5% vs 4.2%). C_LIO_LIThe estimated individual probability of infection increases with decreasing pre-outbreak antibody concentrations, from 12% in the lowest to 5.6% in the highest quartile.

K.; Boehm, A.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295371\nInfluenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and has pandemic potential. Identifying IAV epidemic patterns is essential to inform the timing of vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. In a prospective, longitudinal study design, we measured IAV RNA in wastewater settled solids at 163 wastewater treatment plants across 33 states to characterize the 2022-2023 influenza season at the state, health and human services (HHS) regional, and national scales. Influenza season onset, offset, duration, peak, and intensity using IAV RNA in wastewater were compared with those determined using laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates and outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). The onset for HHS regions as determined by IAV RNA in wastewater roughly corresponded with those determined using ILI when the annual geometric mean of IAV RNA concentration was used as baseline (i.e., the threshold that triggers onset), although offsets between the two differed. IAV RNA in wastewater provided early warning of onset, compared to the ILI estimate, when the baseline was set at twice the limit of IAV RNA detection in wastewater. Peak when determined by IAV RNA in wastewater generally preceded peak determined by IAV hospitalization rate by two weeks or less. Wastewater settled solids data is an IAV-specific indicator that can be used to augment clinical surveillance for seasonal influenza epidemic timing and intensity.

C.; Harding, k. E.; Hrasteljj, J.; Kreft, K.; Holmans, P.; Jones, L.; Robertson, N. P.; Tallantyre, E. C.; Lawton, M. C.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.23295414\nObjectives: To model multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression and compare disease trajectories by sex, age of onset, and year of diagnosis. Study Design and settings: Longitudinal EDSS scores were collected since 1985 for relapse-onset MS patients at MS clinics in South Wales and modelled using a multilevel model (MLM). The MLM adjusted for baseline covariates (sex, age of onset, year of diagnosis, and disease modifying treatments (DMTs)), and included interactions between baseline covariates and time variables. Results: The optimal model was truncated at 30 years after disease onset and excluded EDSS recorded within 3 months of relapse. As expected, older age of onset was associated with faster disease progression at 15 years (effect size (ES): 0.75; CI: 0.63, 0.86; P: \u003c0.001) and female sex progressed more slowly at 15 years (ES: -0.43; CI: -0.68, -0.18; P: \u003c0.001). Patients diagnosed more recently (defined as 2007-2011 and \u003e2011) progressed more slowly than those diagnosed historically (\u003c2006); (ES: -0.46; CI: -0.75, -0.16; P: 0.006) and (ES: -0.95; CI: -1.20, -0.70; P: \u003c0.001), respectively. Conclusion: We present a novel model of MS outcomes, accounting for the nonlinear trajectory of MS and effects of baseline covariates, validating well-known risk factors (sex and age of onset) associated with disease progression. Also, patients diagnosed more recently progressed more slowly than those diagnosed historically.\nFrom Bimodal to Unimodal: The Transformed Incidence of Osteosarcoma in the United States\nAuthors: Kar, E.; Ammanamanchi, A.; Yousif, M.; Devi Geetha, S.; Schwartz, K.; Mishra, A.; Ling, J.; Nonyelu, K. N.; Kannadath, B. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.23294332\nBackgroundOsteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. It has classically been described as having a bimodal incidence by age, with the first peak in the second decade of life and the second peak after 65 years of age. We sought to identify whether the bimodal incidence distribution still exists for osteosarcoma using the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases. MethodsIncidence rates of osteosarcoma between 1975-2020 were analyzed by age, year of occurrence, sex, race, and primary tumor site using the SEER program data. The age of maximum incidence in patients 40 years of age and older was analyzed by calendar year to observe for a consistent second peak. Fishers Exact test was also conducted with the SEER data to assess if there was a significant association between the occurrence of osteosarcoma in patients 35-64 years old and those 65+ years old. Incidence of tumors of the long bones of the lower limbs using ICD-9 and 10 diagnosis codes from the NIS discharge database 2012-2019 were also analyzed for comparison. ResultsA total of 1,779 cases of osteosarcoma were reported in the SEER database from 1975-2020. Across the 46 calendar year span, a consistent first peak appeared in the second decade of life alternating between the 10-14 and 15-19 age groups. In the 40+ cohort, the age of the highest incidence varied widely each calendar year: being found in age groups 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, \u0026 85+ years old (5, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, \u0026 1 times respectively). For 25 years of the 46-year span, the max was shared by more than one age group. Overall, no single age group from the 40+ age group held a consistent maximum from 1975-2020. Using the NIS program and similar methodology, we analyzed 86,100 discharges of lower limb long bone tumors from 2012-2019 as a reference. The NIS data exhibited nearly identical patterns, with a unimodal incidence in adolescence and no obvious second peak. ConclusionOur analysis shows that the incidence of osteosarcoma is no longer bimodally distributed. This may be due to the increased use of bisphosphonates in recent years for the effective management of Pagets disease, leading to a decline in late-age bone tumors. Our findings suggest the need to update our understanding of the epidemiology of osteosarcoma, as it should be considered more as a disease of adolescence with only sporadic incidence later on in older age.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant.

MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported.

ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant).

ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: This study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2[&amp;ge;] 1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation. Methods: We established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results: 97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[&amp;le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[&amp;ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels[&amp;ge;] 1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations[&amp;ge;] 1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established.

ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{&#43;/-}7.8 years, 57% female.

ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data.

Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({&#43;/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{&#43;/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking.

ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality?

FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in &gt;88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk.

MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected healthcare systems and patients. There is a pressing need to comprehend the collateral effects of the pandemic on non-communicable diseases. Here we examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on short-term cancer survival in the United Kingdom (UK). We hypothesised that short-term survival from nine cancers would be reduced during the pandemic, particularly cancers that benefit from screening and early detection (e.g., breast and colorectal cancer). Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Electronic health records from UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database. Participants: There were 12,259,744 eligible patients aged [&amp;ge;]18 years with [&amp;ge;]one year of prior history identified from January 2000 to December 2021. Main outcome measures: We estimated age-standardised incidence rates (IR) and short-term (one- and two-year) survival of several common cancers (breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, oesophagus, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer) from 2000 to 2019 (in five-year strata) compared to 2020 to 2021 using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Apart from pancreatic cancer, IRs decreased for all cancers in 2020 and recovered to different extents in 2021. Short-term survival improved for most cancers between 2000 to 2019, but then declined for those diagnosed in 2020 to 2021.This was most pronounced for colorectal cancer, with one-year survival falling from 79.3% [95% confidence interval: 78.5%-80.1%] in 2015 to 2019 to 76.3% [74.6%-78.1%] for those diagnosed in 2020 to 2021. Conclusion: Short-term survival for many cancers was impacted by the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. This decline was most prominent for colorectal cancer, with reductions in survivorship equivalent to returning to mortality seen in the first decade of the 2000s. These results illustrate the need for an immediate and well-funded investment in resolving the current backlog in cancer screening and diagnostic procedures in the UK National Health Service to improve patient outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to &#34;Long COVID&#34; and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge.

AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany.

MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [&amp;ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection.

Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p&lt;0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p&lt;0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p&lt;0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p&lt;0.001). [&amp;ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0).

ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe aimed to use a large dataset to compare self-reported and primary care measures of insomnia symptom prevalence in England and establish whether they identify participants with similar characteristics.

MethodsWe analysed data from 163,748 UK Biobank participants in England (aged 38-71 at baseline) with linked primary care electronic health records. We compared the percentage of those self-reporting  usually having insomnia symptoms at UK Biobank baseline assessment (2006-2010) to those with a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records prior to baseline. We stratified prevalence in both groups by sociodemographic, lifestyle, sleep and health characteristics.

ResultsWe found that 29% of the sample self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. Only 10% of self-reported cases had an insomnia symptom Read code, whilst 49% of primary care cases self-reported having insomnia symptoms. In both primary care and self-reported data, prevalence of insomnia symptom cases was highest in females, older participants and those with the lowest household incomes.

However, whilst snorers and risk takers were more likely to be a primary care case, they were less likely to self-report insomnia symptoms than non-snorers and non-risk takers.

ConclusionsOnly a small proportion of individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms present to primary care. However, the sociodemographic characteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia were consistent with those with self-reported insomnia, thus primary care records are a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia.

Key PointsO_LIAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on small samples and rely on people self-reporting their symptoms.
C_LIO_LIElectronic health records (EHRs) offer a more objective means of measuring insomnia prevalence, but small-scale studies suggest they only capture a small proportion of insomnia cases. It is therefore unclear how useful EHRs are in measuring the prevalence of insomnia.
C_LIO_LIIn a sample of over 160,000 UK Biobank participants in England we found that 29% of participants self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records.

Plain Language SummaryAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on the responses of a small number of people and rely on them reporting their own symptoms. Peoples medical records offer a more objective way of finding out how many people have insomnia, but only capture people who go to their doctor for help. In this study we compared 160,000 peoples answers to a question on insomnia symptoms to their primary care records. We found that 29% of people reported insomnia symptoms, whereas only 6% had insomnia symptoms recorded in their medical records. However, the characteristics of those reporting insomnia and those with insomnia in their medical records were similar. This means that although medical records only capture a small proportion of those suffering from insomnia, they do still provide useful information for researchers studying risk factors for insomnia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mumps virus is a highly transmissible pathogen that is effectively controlled in countries with high vaccination coverage. Nevertheless, outbreaks have occurred worldwide over the past decades in vaccinated populations. Here we analyse serological data from outbreaks of mumps virus genotype G among college students in the Netherlands over the period 2009-2012. To identify infections in the presence of preexisting antibodies we compared mumps specific serum IgG concentrations in two consecutive samples (n = 746), whereby the first sample was taken when students started their study prior to the outbreaks, and the second sample was taken 2-5 years later. We fit a binary mixture model to the data. The two mixing distributions represent uninfected and infected classes. Throughout we assume that the infection probability increases with the ratio of antibody concentrations of the second to first sample. The estimated infection attack rate is higher than reported earlier (0.095 versus 0.042). The analyses yield probabilistic classifications of participants, which are mostly quite precise owing to the high intraclass correlation in uninfected participants (0.85, 95%CrI: 0.82 - 0.87). The estimated probability of infection increases with decreasing antibody concentration in the pre-outbreak sample, such that the probability of infection is 0.12 (95%CrI: 0.10 - 0.13) for the lowest quartile of the pre-outbreak samples and 0.056 (95%CrI: 0.044 - 0.068) for the highest quartile. We discuss the implications of these insights for the design of booster vaccination strategies.

HighlightsO_LIWe use paired pre- and post-outbreak serological data to estimate mumps infection rates in college students.
C_LIO_LIWe use a two-component mixture model to provide individual estimates of infection for each participant.
C_LIO_LIThe estimated population infection attack rate is higher than reported earlier (9.5% vs 4.2%).
C_LIO_LIThe estimated individual probability of infection increases with decreasing pre-outbreak antibody concentrations, from 12% in the lowest to 5.6% in the highest quartile.

        <p class="abstract">Influenza A virus (IAV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States and has pandemic potential. Identifying IAV epidemic patterns is essential to inform the timing of vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. In a prospective, longitudinal study design, we measured IAV RNA in wastewater settled solids at 163 wastewater treatment plants across 33 states to characterize the 2022-2023 influenza season at the state, health and human services (HHS) regional, and national scales. Influenza season onset, offset, duration, peak, and intensity using IAV RNA in wastewater were compared with those determined using laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates and outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI). The onset for HHS regions as determined by IAV RNA in wastewater roughly corresponded with those determined using ILI when the annual geometric mean of IAV RNA concentration was used as baseline (i.e., the threshold that triggers onset), although offsets between the two differed. IAV RNA in wastewater provided early warning of onset, compared to the ILI estimate, when the baseline was set at twice the limit of IAV RNA detection in wastewater. Peak when determined by IAV RNA in wastewater generally preceded peak determined by IAV hospitalization rate by two weeks or less. Wastewater settled solids data is an IAV-specific indicator that can be used to augment clinical surveillance for seasonal influenza epidemic timing and intensity.

        <p class="abstract">Objectives: To model multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression and compare disease trajectories by sex, age of onset, and year of diagnosis. Study Design and settings: Longitudinal EDSS scores were collected since 1985 for relapse-onset MS patients at MS clinics in South Wales and modelled using a multilevel model (MLM). The MLM adjusted for baseline covariates (sex, age of onset, year of diagnosis, and disease modifying treatments (DMTs)), and included interactions between baseline covariates and time variables. Results: The optimal model was truncated at 30 years after disease onset and excluded EDSS recorded within 3 months of relapse. As expected, older age of onset was associated with faster disease progression at 15 years (effect size (ES): 0.75; CI: 0.63, 0.86; P: &lt;0.001) and female sex progressed more slowly at 15 years (ES: -0.43; CI: -0.68, -0.18; P: &lt;0.001). Patients diagnosed more recently (defined as 2007-2011 and &gt;2011) progressed more slowly than those diagnosed historically (&lt;2006); (ES: -0.46; CI: -0.75, -0.16; P: 0.006) and (ES: -0.95; CI: -1.20, -0.70; P: &lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusion: We present a novel model of MS outcomes, accounting for the nonlinear trajectory of MS and effects of baseline covariates, validating well-known risk factors (sex and age of onset) associated with disease progression. Also, patients diagnosed more recently progressed more slowly than those diagnosed historically.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOsteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. It has classically been described as having a bimodal incidence by age, with the first peak in the second decade of life and the second peak after 65 years of age. We sought to identify whether the bimodal incidence distribution still exists for osteosarcoma using the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases.

MethodsIncidence rates of osteosarcoma between 1975-2020 were analyzed by age, year of occurrence, sex, race, and primary tumor site using the SEER program data. The age of maximum incidence in patients 40 years of age and older was analyzed by calendar year to observe for a consistent second peak. Fishers Exact test was also conducted with the SEER data to assess if there was a significant association between the occurrence of osteosarcoma in patients 35-64 years old and those 65&#43; years old. Incidence of tumors of the long bones of the lower limbs using ICD-9 and 10 diagnosis codes from the NIS discharge database 2012-2019 were also analyzed for comparison.

ResultsA total of 1,779 cases of osteosarcoma were reported in the SEER database from 1975-2020. Across the 46 calendar year span, a consistent first peak appeared in the second decade of life alternating between the 10-14 and 15-19 age groups. In the 40&#43; cohort, the age of the highest incidence varied widely each calendar year: being found in age groups 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, &amp; 85&#43; years old (5, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, &amp; 1 times respectively). For 25 years of the 46-year span, the max was shared by more than one age group. Overall, no single age group from the 40&#43; age group held a consistent maximum from 1975-2020.

Using the NIS program and similar methodology, we analyzed 86,100 discharges of lower limb long bone tumors from 2012-2019 as a reference. The NIS data exhibited nearly identical patterns, with a unimodal incidence in adolescence and no obvious second peak.

ConclusionOur analysis shows that the incidence of osteosarcoma is no longer bimodally distributed. This may be due to the increased use of bisphosphonates in recent years for the effective management of Pagets disease, leading to a decline in late-age bone tumors. Our findings suggest the need to update our understanding of the epidemiology of osteosarcoma, as it should be considered more as a disease of adolescence with only sporadic incidence later on in older age.</p>
