Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nWastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 gene for COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance in Tucuman Argentina\nAuthors: DArpino, M. C.; Sineli, P. E.; Goroso, G.; Watanabe, W.; Saavedra, L.; Hebert, E. M.; Martinez, A.; Migliavacca, J.; Gerstenfeld, S.; Chahla, R. E.; Bellomio, A.; Albarracin, V. H.\nScore: 30.3, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298851\nWastewater-based epidemiology provides temporal and spatial information about the health status of a population. The objective of this study was to analyze and report the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Tucuman, Argentina during the second and third surges of COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022. The study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, correlating it with clinically reported COVID-19 cases. Wastewater samples (n=72) were collected from 16 sampling points located in 3 cities of Tucuman (San Miguel de Tucuman, Yerba Buena and Banda del Rio Sali). Detection of viral nucleocapsid markers (N1 gene) was carried out using one-step RT-qPCR. Viral loads were determined for each positive sample using a standard curve. A positive correlation (p\u003c0.05) was observed between viral load (copies/mL) and the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during the sampling period in San Miguel de Tucuman. Our findings allowed us to monitor the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 infection during epidemic outbreaks. Wastewater monitoring is a valuable epidemiological indicator that enables the anticipation of increases in COVID-19 cases and tracking the progress of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based surveillance should be implemented as a routine practice to prepare for any future surge in infections.\nMuscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities is associated with multimorbidity burden in older adults: the Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA)\nAuthors: Mau, T.; Blackwell, T. L.; Cawthon, P. M.; Molina, A. J. A.; Coen, P. M.; Distefano, G.; Kramer, P. A.; Ramos, S. V.; Forman, D. E.; Goodpaster, B. H.; Toledo, F. G. S.; Duchowny, K. A.; Sparks, L. M.; Newman, A. B.; Kritchevsky, S. B.; Cummings, S. R.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298175\nBackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity. MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3+ conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions. ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI+CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

Z.; Kunatharaju, S.; Golder, S.; Levine, L. D.; Figueiredo, J. C.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298696\nBackgroundPreterm birth, defined as birth at \u003c37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth. MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [\u0026ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36). ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21). ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.\nEstimating Between Country Migration in Pneumococcal Populations\nAuthors: Belman, S.; Pesonen, H.; Croucher, N.; Bentley, S. D.; Corander, J.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298520\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a globally distributed, human obligate opportunistic bacterial pathogen which, although often carried commensally, is also a significant cause of invasive disease. Apart from multi-drug resistant and virulent clones, the rate and direction of pneumococcal dissemination between different countries remains largely unknown. The ability for the pneumococcus to take a foothold in a country depends on existing population configuration, the extent of vaccine implementation, as well as human mobility since it is a human obligate bacterium. To shed light on its international movement, we used extensive genome data from the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project and estimated migration parameters between multiple countries in Africa. Data on allele frequencies of polymorphisms at housekeeping-like loci for multiple different lineages circulating in the populations of South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, and The Gambia were used to calculate the fixation index (Fst) between countries. We then further used these summaries to fit migration coalescent models with the likelihood-free inference algorithms available in the ELFI software package. Synthetic data were additionally used to validate the inference approach. Our results demonstrate country-pair specific migration patterns and heterogeneity in the extent of migration between different lineages. Our approach demonstrates that coalescent models can be effectively used for inferring migration rates for bacterial species and lineages provided sufficiently granular population genomics surveillance data. Further it can demonstrate the connectivity of respiratory disease agents between countries to inform intervention policy in the longer term.\nTemporal contact patterns and the implications for predicting superspreaders and planning of targeted outbreak control\nAuthors: Pung, R.; Firth, J. A.; Russell, T.; Rogers, T.; Lee, V. J.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298919\nEpidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify 'superspreaders', and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions.\nNationwide SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Trends in the Netherlands in the Variant of Concern Era, 2021-2022: an Ongoing Prospective Cohort Study\nAuthors: Vos, E. R. A.; van Hagen, C. C. E.; Wong, D.; Smits, G.; Kuijer, M.; Wijmenga-Monsuur, A. J.; Kaczorowska, J.; van Binnendijk, R. S.; van der Klis, F. R. M.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298889\nBackgroundRepeated population-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance is key in complementing other surveillance tools. AimAssessing trends in infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity, including breakthrough infections, among (sub)groups and regions in the Dutch population during the Variant of Concern (VOC)-era whilst varying levels of stringency, to evaluate population immunity dynamics and inform future pandemic response planning. MethodsIn this prospective population-based cohort, randomly-selected participants (n=9,985) aged 1-92 years (recruited since early-2020) donated home-collected fingerstick blood samples at six timepoints in 2021-2022, covering waves dominated by Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). IgG antibody assessments against Spike-S1 and Nucleoprotein were combined with vaccination- and testing data to estimate infection-induced (inf) and total (infection- and vaccination-induced) seroprevalence. ResultsIn 2021, nationwide inf-seroprevalence rose modestly from 12% since Alpha to 26% amidst Delta, while total seroprevalence increased rapidly to nearly 90%, particularly fast in vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly and those with comorbidities). Highest infection rates were noticeable in adolescents and young adults, low/middle educated elderly, non-Western, contact professions (other than healthcare), and low-vaccination coverage regions. In 2022, following Omicron emergence, inf-seroprevalence elevated sharply to 62% and further to 86%, with frequent breakthrough infections and reduction of seroprevalence dissimilarities between most groups. Whereas \u003e90% of \u003c60-year-olds had been infected, 30% of vaccinated vulnerable individuals had not acquired hybrid immunity. ConclusionAlthough total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence had increased rapidly, infection rates were unequally distributed within the Dutch population. Ongoing tailored vaccination efforts and (sero-)monitoring of vulnerable groups remain important given their lowest rate of hybrid immunity and highest susceptibility to severe disease.\nThe Medical Impact of Emergent Banning of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)- contaminated Antihypertensive Drug: A nationwide longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Ahn, J.; Won, S.; Park, J.-H.; Shimbo, D.; Lee, H.-Y.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297897\nOBJECTIVETo study the association of NDMA-contaminated generic valsartan with cancer incidence. DESIGNNationwide longitudinal observational cohort study. SETTINGClaims data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea was analyzed using 1:1:1 pairwise propensity score matching (PSM) of NDMA-uncontaminated original, NDMA-contaminated generic, and initially-suspended-but-finally confirmed as NDMA-uncontaminated generic valsartan user-groups. Time-dependent Cox models and dose- response evaluation were used to evaluate carcinogenicity. PARTICIPANTSA total of 3,231,212 participants with satisfactory minimal adherence, followed up from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONSAt least one tablet of valsartan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was primary cancer incidence and secondary outcome was 12 prevalent organ-specific cancer incidences. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks were estimated before and after valsartan withdrawal. RESULTSAmong participants (mean [standard deviation] age 59.5 [13.1] years; male, 53.5%), new users had adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.069 (1.054 to 1.085) and 1.142 (1.100 to 1.186) for any cancer in the NDMA-exposed period (versus NDMA-unexposed) before and after 1:1:1 PSM, respectively. Regardless of PSM, lung and prostate cancer risks increased significantly during the NDMA-exposed period whereas, post-PSM, cancer risk did not increase in the eventually-NDMA-uncontaminated group, even in new users. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not differ significantly with NDMA exposure before and after emergent banning. CONCLUSIONSNDMA-contaminated valsartan increased cancer risk, especially of lung and prostate cancers. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not evidently increase following banning. This supports emergent health-policy action against potentially carcinogenic drugs.\nASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: RESULTS FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT\nAuthors: Sekendiz, Z.; Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Carr, M. A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1188.0, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nChatGPT for assessing risk of bias of randomized trials using the RoB 2.0 tool: A methods study\nAuthors: Pitre, T.; Jassal, T.; Talukdar, J. R.; Shahab, M.; Ling, M.; Zeraatkar, D.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.19.23298727\nBackgroundThe assessment of risk of bias is a critical component of systematic review methods. Assessing risk of bias, however, can be time- and resource-intensive. AI-based solutions may increase efficiency and reduce burden. ObjectiveTo evaluate the reliability of ChatGPT for performing risk of bias assessments of randomized trials. MethodsWe sampled recently published Cochrane systematic reviews of medical interventions (up to October 2023) that included randomized controlled trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane-endorsed revised risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). From each eligible review, we collected data on the risk of bias assessments for the first three reported outcomes. Using ChatGPT-4, we assessed the risk of bias for the same outcomes using three different prompts: a minimal prompt including limited instructions, a maximal prompt with extensive instructions, and an optimized prompt that was designed to yield the best risk of bias judgments. The agreement between ChatGPTs assessments and those of the systematic reviewers was quantified using weighted kappa statistics. ResultsWe included 34 systematic reviews with 157 unique trials. We found the agreement between ChatGPT and systematic review authors for assessment of overall risk of bias to be 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.3) for the maximal ChatGPT prompt, 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32) for the optimized prompt, and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.27) for the minimal prompt. For the optimized prompt, agreement ranged between 0.11 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.33) to 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.44) across risk of bias domains, with the lowest agreement for the deviations from the intended intervention domain and the highest agreement for the missing outcome data domain. ConclusionOur results suggest that ChatGPT and systematic reviewers only have \"slight\" to \"fair\" agreement in risk of bias judgments for randomized trials. ChatGPT is currently unable to reliably assess risk of bias of randomized trials. We recommend systematic reviewers avoid using ChatGPT to perform risk of bias assessments.\n",

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology provides temporal and spatial information about the health status of a population. The objective of this study was to analyze and report the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the province of Tucuman, Argentina during the second and third surges of COVID-19 between April 2021 and March 2022. The study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, correlating it with clinically reported COVID-19 cases. Wastewater samples (n=72) were collected from 16 sampling points located in 3 cities of Tucuman (San Miguel de Tucuman, Yerba Buena and Banda del Rio Sali). Detection of viral nucleocapsid markers (N1 gene) was carried out using one-step RT-qPCR. Viral loads were determined for each positive sample using a standard curve. A positive correlation (p&lt;0.05) was observed between viral load (copies/mL) and the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during the sampling period in San Miguel de Tucuman. Our findings allowed us to monitor the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 infection during epidemic outbreaks. Wastewater monitoring is a valuable epidemiological indicator that enables the anticipation of increases in COVID-19 cases and tracking the progress of the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 genome-based surveillance should be implemented as a routine practice to prepare for any future surge in infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity.

MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3&#43; conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions.

ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI&#43;CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPreterm birth, defined as birth at &lt;37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&amp;ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).

ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21).

ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a globally distributed, human obligate opportunistic bacterial pathogen which, although often carried commensally, is also a significant cause of invasive disease. Apart from multi-drug resistant and virulent clones, the rate and direction of pneumococcal dissemination between different countries remains largely unknown. The ability for the pneumococcus to take a foothold in a country depends on existing population configuration, the extent of vaccine implementation, as well as human mobility since it is a human obligate bacterium. To shed light on its international movement, we used extensive genome data from the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project and estimated migration parameters between multiple countries in Africa. Data on allele frequencies of polymorphisms at housekeeping-like loci for multiple different lineages circulating in the populations of South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, and The Gambia were used to calculate the fixation index (Fst) between countries. We then further used these summaries to fit migration coalescent models with the likelihood-free inference algorithms available in the ELFI software package. Synthetic data were additionally used to validate the inference approach. Our results demonstrate country-pair specific migration patterns and heterogeneity in the extent of migration between different lineages. Our approach demonstrates that coalescent models can be effectively used for inferring migration rates for bacterial species and lineages provided sufficiently granular population genomics surveillance data. Further it can demonstrate the connectivity of respiratory disease agents between countries to inform intervention policy in the longer term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify &#39;superspreaders&#39;, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRepeated population-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance is key in complementing other surveillance tools.

AimAssessing trends in infection- and/or vaccine-induced immunity, including breakthrough infections, among (sub)groups and regions in the Dutch population during the Variant of Concern (VOC)-era whilst varying levels of stringency, to evaluate population immunity dynamics and inform future pandemic response planning.

MethodsIn this prospective population-based cohort, randomly-selected participants (n=9,985) aged 1-92 years (recruited since early-2020) donated home-collected fingerstick blood samples at six timepoints in 2021-2022, covering waves dominated by Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.5). IgG antibody assessments against Spike-S1 and Nucleoprotein were combined with vaccination- and testing data to estimate infection-induced (inf) and total (infection- and vaccination-induced) seroprevalence.

ResultsIn 2021, nationwide inf-seroprevalence rose modestly from 12% since Alpha to 26% amidst Delta, while total seroprevalence increased rapidly to nearly 90%, particularly fast in vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly and those with comorbidities). Highest infection rates were noticeable in adolescents and young adults, low/middle educated elderly, non-Western, contact professions (other than healthcare), and low-vaccination coverage regions. In 2022, following Omicron emergence, inf-seroprevalence elevated sharply to 62% and further to 86%, with frequent breakthrough infections and reduction of seroprevalence dissimilarities between most groups. Whereas &gt;90% of &lt;60-year-olds had been infected, 30% of vaccinated vulnerable individuals had not acquired hybrid immunity.

ConclusionAlthough total SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence had increased rapidly, infection rates were unequally distributed within the Dutch population. Ongoing tailored vaccination efforts and (sero-)monitoring of vulnerable groups remain important given their lowest rate of hybrid immunity and highest susceptibility to severe disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo study the association of NDMA-contaminated generic valsartan with cancer incidence.

DESIGNNationwide longitudinal observational cohort study.

SETTINGClaims data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea was analyzed using 1:1:1 pairwise propensity score matching (PSM) of NDMA-uncontaminated original, NDMA-contaminated generic, and initially-suspended-but-finally confirmed as NDMA-uncontaminated generic valsartan user-groups. Time-dependent Cox models and dose- response evaluation were used to evaluate carcinogenicity.

PARTICIPANTSA total of 3,231,212 participants with satisfactory minimal adherence, followed up from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2020.

INTERVENTIONSAt least one tablet of valsartan.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was primary cancer incidence and secondary outcome was 12 prevalent organ-specific cancer incidences. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks were estimated before and after valsartan withdrawal.

RESULTSAmong participants (mean [standard deviation] age 59.5 [13.1] years; male, 53.5%), new users had adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.069 (1.054 to 1.085) and 1.142 (1.100 to 1.186) for any cancer in the NDMA-exposed period (versus NDMA-unexposed) before and after 1:1:1 PSM, respectively. Regardless of PSM, lung and prostate cancer risks increased significantly during the NDMA-exposed period whereas, post-PSM, cancer risk did not increase in the eventually-NDMA-uncontaminated group, even in new users. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not differ significantly with NDMA exposure before and after emergent banning.

CONCLUSIONSNDMA-contaminated valsartan increased cancer risk, especially of lung and prostate cancers. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not evidently increase following banning. This supports emergent health-policy action against potentially carcinogenic drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe assessment of risk of bias is a critical component of systematic review methods. Assessing risk of bias, however, can be time- and resource-intensive. AI-based solutions may increase efficiency and reduce burden.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the reliability of ChatGPT for performing risk of bias assessments of randomized trials.

MethodsWe sampled recently published Cochrane systematic reviews of medical interventions (up to October 2023) that included randomized controlled trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane-endorsed revised risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). From each eligible review, we collected data on the risk of bias assessments for the first three reported outcomes. Using ChatGPT-4, we assessed the risk of bias for the same outcomes using three different prompts: a minimal prompt including limited instructions, a maximal prompt with extensive instructions, and an optimized prompt that was designed to yield the best risk of bias judgments. The agreement between ChatGPTs assessments and those of the systematic reviewers was quantified using weighted kappa statistics.

ResultsWe included 34 systematic reviews with 157 unique trials. We found the agreement between ChatGPT and systematic review authors for assessment of overall risk of bias to be 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.3) for the maximal ChatGPT prompt, 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32) for the optimized prompt, and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.27) for the minimal prompt. For the optimized prompt, agreement ranged between 0.11 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.33) to 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.44) across risk of bias domains, with the lowest agreement for the deviations from the intended intervention domain and the highest agreement for the missing outcome data domain.

ConclusionOur results suggest that ChatGPT and systematic reviewers only have &#34;slight&#34; to &#34;fair&#34; agreement in risk of bias judgments for randomized trials. ChatGPT is currently unable to reliably assess risk of bias of randomized trials. We recommend systematic reviewers avoid using ChatGPT to perform risk of bias assessments.</p>
