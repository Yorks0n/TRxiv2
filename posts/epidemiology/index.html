R.\nScore: 45.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.19.23290239\nIntroduction: Dramatic increases in U.S. drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, beginning around 2014 have driven a marked progression in overall drug overdose deaths in the U.S., sharply rising after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in drug overdose deaths by educational attainment (EA) during the fentanyl era of the drug overdose epidemic and its intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic have not been widely scrutinized. Methods: Utilizing restricted-use mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the American Community Survey, we estimated annual national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) from drug overdoses jointly stratified by EA and sex for adults aged 25-64 from 2015 to 2021. State-level AAMRs in 2015 and 2021 were also estimated to examine the geographic variation in the cumulative evolution of EA-related disparities over the course of the analysis period. Results: Nationally, AAMRs rose fastest among persons with at most a high school-level education, whereas little to no change was observed for bachelor's degree holders, widening pre-existing disparities. During the analysis period, the difference in national AAMRs between persons with at most a high school-level education and bachelor's degree holders increased from less than 8-fold (2015) to approximately 13-fold (2021). The national widening of EA-related disparities accelerated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and they widened in nearly every state. Among non-bachelor's degree holders, national AAMRs increased markedly faster for males. Conclusions: The widening disparities in drug overdose deaths by EA are a likely indicator of a rapidly increasing socioeconomic divide in drug overdose mortality more broadly. Policy strategies should address upstream socioeconomic drivers of drug use and overdose, particularly among males.\nIs influenza B/Yamagata extinct and what public health implications could this have? An updated literature review and comprehensive assessment of global surveillance databases.\nAuthors: Caini, S.; Meijer, A.; Nunes, M. C.; Henaff, L.; Zounon, M.; Boudewijns, B.; Del Riccio, M.; Paget, J.\nScore: 44.7, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296068\nIntroductionEarly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information. MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide. ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation. DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.\nProtection of second booster vaccinations and prior infection against SARS-CoV-2 in the UK SIREN healthcare worker cohort\nAuthors: Kirwan, P. D.; Hall, V. J.; Foulkes, S.; Otter, A.; Munro, K.; Sparkes, D.; Howells, A.; Platt, N.; Broad, J.; Crossman, D.; Norman, C.; Corrigan, D.; Jackson, C. H.; Cole, M.; Brown, C. S.; Atti, A.; Islam, J.; SIREN Study Group, ; Presanis, A.; Charlett, A.; De Angelis, D.; Hopkins, S.\nScore: 27.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296330\nBackgroundThe protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers. MethodsParticipants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated. Results1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI - 11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection \u003e2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection. ConclusionsDespite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern.

C. M.; Andrews, N.; Stowe, J.; Dabrera, G.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296290\nBackgroundIn England, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a spring 2023 booster programme for all adults aged 75 years and older and the immunosuppressed. The vaccines advised were the Sanofi/GSK AS03-adjuvanted monovalent beta variant (VidPrevtyn Beta) booster vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5) bivalent vaccine. This is the first time an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine has been administered as part of a UK COVID-19 vaccination programme. In clinical trials, the antibody levels generated by the Sanofi/GSK vaccine were comparable to levels generated by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines but to date there are no real-world data on the effectiveness or duration of protection of this vaccine. MethodsWe used a test-negative case-control study design to estimate the incremental vaccine effectiveness of the Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer bivalent BA.4-5 boosters against hospitalisation amongst those aged 75 years and older in England. The study period for tests contributing to all analyses was from 3rd April 2022 to 27th August 2023. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated relative to those who had received at least two doses prior to their spring booster, with their last dose being an autumn 2022 booster given at least 3 months prior. FindingsOverall, there were 14,174 eligible tests from hospitalised individuals aged 75 years and older, with 3,005 being cases and 11,169 being controls. Effectiveness against hospitalisation was highest in the period 9 to 13 days post vaccination for both manufacturers at about 50%; 43.6% (95% C.I.; 20.1 to 60.2%) and 56.4% (95% C.I; 25.8 to 74.4%) for Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5, respectively. There was some evidence of waning with a reduction to about 30% for both manufacturers 5-9 weeks post vaccination. InterpretationTogether, these results provide reassuring evidence that both the adjuvanted Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5 booster vaccines provided a good boost to protection against hospitalisation amongst adults aged 75 years and older. The finding that the adjuvanted vaccine targeting the now distant Beta strain had similar effectiveness to the mRNA vaccine targeting more closely matched Omicron sub-lineages BA.4-5 during a period of Omicron circulation may reflect improved protection due to the adjuvant in the Sanofi/GSK product.

Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.\nHow demographic factors matter for antimicrobial resistance - quantification of the patterns and impact of variation in prevalence of resistance by age and sex.\nAuthors: Waterlow, N. R.; Cooper, B. S.; Robotham, J. V.; Knight, G. M.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23296060\nBackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values. In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation. ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40. At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli. ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.\nModelling the impact of population mobility, post-infection immunity and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Dominican Republic\nAuthors: Finch, E.; Nilles, E. J.; Then Paulino, C.; Skewes-Ramm, R.; Lau, C.; Lowe, R.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296586\nCOVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations. We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios. We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to 'buy' in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.\nDistrict Level Variation in Hypertension Epidemiology in India and Influence of Social Determinants: National Family Health Survey-5\nAuthors: Gupta, R.; Gaur, K.; Sharma, S. C.; Khedar, R. S.; Dhamija, R. K.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296421\nBACKGROUNDEnumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants. METHODSWe used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report. RESULTSAge-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (\u003c30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p\u003c0.05). CONCLUSIONSThe study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women. SUMMARY TABLE What is known about the topicO_LISignificant state-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India has been reported but district-level variation is not known. C_LIO_LISocial determinants are important in hypertension but not well studied, especially in women. C_LI What this study addsO_LIThe study shows a significant district-level variation with greater hypertension prevalence in southern and western India. C_LIO_LIHypertension among the young, \u003c30 years, is more in less developed districts.

M.; Masel, J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296661\nIn this paper, we present a simple model that shows how to optimally target interventions based on the estimated risk of infectiousness of individuals. Our model can help policymakers decide when to use different types of interventions during a pandemic, depending on their precision, which is the fraction of positive predictions that are true positives. We show that targeted interventions, even with very low precision, can impose a much smaller overall burden on the population than non-targeted alternatives, such as lockdowns or mass testing. To illustrate this, we use data from the NHS contact tracing system in the UK to construct a risk function based on second degree contact tracing, which is similar to the strategy used by Vietnam in 2020. We find that with moderate precision (greater than 1/1000) and sufficient sensitivity (greater than 1-1/R0), countries can cope with a large number of imported cases without resorting to social distancing measures, while keeping the per-person probabilities of both infection and quarantine very low. We also show that targeted strategies are often orders of magnitude better than default strategies, making them robustly beneficial even under significant uncertainty about most parameters.\nChildhood Adversity and COVID-19 Outcomes: Findings from the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Hanson, J. L.; O'Connor, K. A.; Adkins, D. J.; Kahhale, I.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.20.23287479\nObjectivesTo investigate the association between childhood adversity and COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank. DesignCohort study. SettingUnited Kingdom. Participants151,200 participants in the UK Biobank cohort who had completed the Childhood Trauma Screen, were alive at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (01-10-2021), and were still active in the UK Biobank when hospitalization and mortality data were most recently updated (11-2021). Main outcome measuresCOVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality. ResultsHigher self-reports of childhood adversity were related to greater likelihood of COVID-19-related hospitalization in all statistical models. In models adjusted for age, ethnicity, and sex, childhood adversity was associated with an OR of 1.227 of hospitalization (95% CI=1.153 to 1.306, Childhood Adversity z=6.49, p\u003c0.005) and an OR of 1.25 of a COVID-19 related death (95% CI=1.11 to 1.424, Childhood Adversity z=3.5, p\u003c0.005). Adjustment for potential confounds attenuated these associations, although associations remained statistically significant. ConclusionsChildhood adversity was significantly associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic and health confounders. Further research is needed to clarify the biological and psychosocial processes underlying these associations to inform public health intervention and prevention strategies to minimize COVID-19 disparities.

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Dramatic increases in U.S. drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, beginning around 2014 have driven a marked progression in overall drug overdose deaths in the U.S., sharply rising after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in drug overdose deaths by educational attainment (EA) during the fentanyl era of the drug overdose epidemic and its intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic have not been widely scrutinized. Methods: Utilizing restricted-use mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System and population estimates from the American Community Survey, we estimated annual national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) from drug overdoses jointly stratified by EA and sex for adults aged 25-64 from 2015 to 2021. State-level AAMRs in 2015 and 2021 were also estimated to examine the geographic variation in the cumulative evolution of EA-related disparities over the course of the analysis period. Results: Nationally, AAMRs rose fastest among persons with at most a high school-level education, whereas little to no change was observed for bachelor&#39;s degree holders, widening pre-existing disparities. During the analysis period, the difference in national AAMRs between persons with at most a high school-level education and bachelor&#39;s degree holders increased from less than 8-fold (2015) to approximately 13-fold (2021). The national widening of EA-related disparities accelerated amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and they widened in nearly every state. Among non-bachelor&#39;s degree holders, national AAMRs increased markedly faster for males. Conclusions: The widening disparities in drug overdose deaths by EA are a likely indicator of a rapidly increasing socioeconomic divide in drug overdose mortality more broadly. Policy strategies should address upstream socioeconomic drivers of drug use and overdose, particularly among males.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEarly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information.

MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide.

ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation.

DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers.

MethodsParticipants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated.

Results1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI - 11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection &gt;2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection.

ConclusionsDespite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn England, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a spring 2023 booster programme for all adults aged 75 years and older and the immunosuppressed. The vaccines advised were the Sanofi/GSK AS03-adjuvanted monovalent beta variant (VidPrevtyn Beta) booster vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5) bivalent vaccine. This is the first time an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine has been administered as part of a UK COVID-19 vaccination programme. In clinical trials, the antibody levels generated by the Sanofi/GSK vaccine were comparable to levels generated by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines but to date there are no real-world data on the effectiveness or duration of protection of this vaccine.

MethodsWe used a test-negative case-control study design to estimate the incremental vaccine effectiveness of the Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer bivalent BA.4-5 boosters against hospitalisation amongst those aged 75 years and older in England. The study period for tests contributing to all analyses was from 3rd April 2022 to 27th August 2023. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated relative to those who had received at least two doses prior to their spring booster, with their last dose being an autumn 2022 booster given at least 3 months prior.

FindingsOverall, there were 14,174 eligible tests from hospitalised individuals aged 75 years and older, with 3,005 being cases and 11,169 being controls. Effectiveness against hospitalisation was highest in the period 9 to 13 days post vaccination for both manufacturers at about 50%; 43.6% (95% C.I.; 20.1 to 60.2%) and 56.4% (95% C.I; 25.8 to 74.4%) for Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5, respectively. There was some evidence of waning with a reduction to about 30% for both manufacturers 5-9 weeks post vaccination.

InterpretationTogether, these results provide reassuring evidence that both the adjuvanted Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5 booster vaccines provided a good boost to protection against hospitalisation amongst adults aged 75 years and older. The finding that the adjuvanted vaccine targeting the now distant Beta strain had similar effectiveness to the mRNA vaccine targeting more closely matched Omicron sub-lineages BA.4-5 during a period of Omicron circulation may reflect improved protection due to the adjuvant in the Sanofi/GSK product.

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 has become endemic, with dynamics that reflect the waning of immunity and re-exposure, by contrast to the epidemic phase driven by exposure in immunologically naive populations. Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values.

In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation.

ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40.

At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli.

ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations. We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios. We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to &#39;buy&#39; in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDEnumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants.

METHODSWe used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report.

RESULTSAge-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (&lt;30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p&lt;0.05).

CONCLUSIONSThe study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women.

        <p class="abstract">In this paper, we present a simple model that shows how to optimally target interventions based on the estimated risk of infectiousness of individuals. Our model can help policymakers decide when to use different types of interventions during a pandemic, depending on their precision, which is the fraction of positive predictions that are true positives. We show that targeted interventions, even with very low precision, can impose a much smaller overall burden on the population than non-targeted alternatives, such as lockdowns or mass testing. To illustrate this, we use data from the NHS contact tracing system in the UK to construct a risk function based on second degree contact tracing, which is similar to the strategy used by Vietnam in 2020. We find that with moderate precision (greater than 1/1000) and sufficient sensitivity (greater than 1-1/R0), countries can cope with a large number of imported cases without resorting to social distancing measures, while keeping the per-person probabilities of both infection and quarantine very low. We also show that targeted strategies are often orders of magnitude better than default strategies, making them robustly beneficial even under significant uncertainty about most parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo investigate the association between childhood adversity and COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank.

DesignCohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

Participants151,200 participants in the UK Biobank cohort who had completed the Childhood Trauma Screen, were alive at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (01-10-2021), and were still active in the UK Biobank when hospitalization and mortality data were most recently updated (11-2021).

Main outcome measuresCOVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality.

ResultsHigher self-reports of childhood adversity were related to greater likelihood of COVID-19-related hospitalization in all statistical models. In models adjusted for age, ethnicity, and sex, childhood adversity was associated with an OR of 1.227 of hospitalization (95% CI=1.153 to 1.306, Childhood Adversity z=6.49, p&lt;0.005) and an OR of 1.25 of a COVID-19 related death (95% CI=1.11 to 1.424, Childhood Adversity z=3.5, p&lt;0.005). Adjustment for potential confounds attenuated these associations, although associations remained statistically significant.

ConclusionsChildhood adversity was significantly associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic and health confounders. Further research is needed to clarify the biological and psychosocial processes underlying these associations to inform public health intervention and prevention strategies to minimize COVID-19 disparities.

Trial registrationWork Completed under UK Biobank Project ID 92699 (&#34;Associations between COVID-19 Symptoms &amp; Stressful Life Experiences&#34;).
