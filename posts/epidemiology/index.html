Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant. MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported. ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant). ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.\nVentilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\nAuthors: Zand, M. S.; Spallina, S.; Ross, A.; Zandi, K.; Pawlowski, A.; Seplaki, C.; Herington, J.; Corbett, A.; Kaukeinen, K.; Freedman, E.; Holden-Wiltse, J.; Alcantara, L.; Li, D.; Cameron, A.; Beaumont, N.; Dozier, A.; Dewhurst, S.; Foxe, J.\nScore: 33.1, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295268\nBackground: This study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 [\u0026ge;]1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure that is suspected to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is classroom ventilation. Methods: We established a community engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 rooms in the school, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results: 97% of rooms had an estimated ACH [\u0026le;]4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels [\u0026ge;]1,000 PPM for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [\u0026ge;]1,000 PPM and per-room SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed cases, accounting for 21% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community engaged research project. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 levels [\u0026ge;]1,000 PPM during the school day and SARS-CoV-2 cases in that room in an IDD school. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.\nLight at night and modeled circadian disruption predict higher risk of mortality: A prospective study in \u003e88,000 participants\nAuthors: Windred, D. P.; Burns, A. C.; Lane, J. M.; Olivier, P.; Rutter, M. K.; Saxena, R.; Phillips, A. J. K.; Cain, S. W.\nScore: 26.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295231\nImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingUnited Kingdom. ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 57% female. ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{+/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality? FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in \u003e88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk. MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.\nWITHDRAWN: A Mixed-Effects Model to Predict COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using Wastewater Surveillance\nAuthors: Daza-Torres, M.

A.; Richmond, R. C.; Eastwood, S. V.; Davies, N. M.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.23295191\nPurposeWe aimed to use a large dataset to compare self-reported and primary care measures of insomnia symptom prevalence in England and establish whether they identify participants with similar characteristics. MethodsWe analysed data from 163,748 UK Biobank participants in England (aged 38-71 at baseline) with linked primary care electronic health records. We compared the percentage of those self-reporting usually having insomnia symptoms at UK Biobank baseline assessment (2006-2010) to those with a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records prior to baseline. We stratified prevalence in both groups by sociodemographic, lifestyle, sleep and health characteristics. ResultsWe found that 29% of the sample self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. Only 10% of self-reported cases had an insomnia symptom Read code, whilst 49% of primary care cases self-reported having insomnia symptoms. In both primary care and self-reported data, prevalence of insomnia symptom cases was highest in females, older participants and those with the lowest household incomes. However, whilst snorers and risk takers were more likely to be a primary care case, they were less likely to self-report insomnia symptoms than non-snorers and non-risk takers. ConclusionsOnly a small proportion of individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms present to primary care. However, the sociodemographic characteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia were consistent with those with self-reported insomnia, thus primary care records are a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia. Key PointsO_LIAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on small samples and rely on people self-reporting their symptoms. C_LIO_LIElectronic health records (EHRs) offer a more objective means of measuring insomnia prevalence, but small-scale studies suggest they only capture a small proportion of insomnia cases. It is therefore unclear how useful EHRs are in measuring the prevalence of insomnia. C_LIO_LIIn a sample of over 160,000 UK Biobank participants in England we found that 29% of participants self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. C_LIO_LICharacteristics of people attending primary care with insomnia symptoms are similar to those self-reporting insomnia symptoms, suggesting EHRs offer a valuable data source for studying risk factors for insomnia. C_LI Plain Language SummaryAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on the responses of a small number of people and rely on them reporting their own symptoms. Peoples medical records offer a more objective way of finding out how many people have insomnia, but only capture people who go to their doctor for help. In this study we compared 160,000 peoples answers to a question on insomnia symptoms to their primary care records. We found that 29% of people reported insomnia symptoms, whereas only 6% had insomnia symptoms recorded in their medical records. However, the characteristics of those reporting insomnia and those with insomnia in their medical records were similar. This means that although medical records only capture a small proportion of those suffering from insomnia, they do still provide useful information for researchers studying risk factors for insomnia.\nAn explosion of alternative medicines in France! Media-biased polyphonic epidemiology vs. evidence-based data.\nAuthors: Berna, F.; Florens, N.; Verneuil, L.; Paille, F.; Berna, C.; Nizard, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294995\nBackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an \"explosion\" in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly \"boosted\" by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports \"a dramatic uptick\" in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution. This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) \"increases\" or \"explosion\" might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009. MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic. ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an \"explosion\" in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM. ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.\nUnraveling the role of rise in temperature on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance\nAuthors: Goswami, A.; Morris, J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295147\nThe ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics, or antimicrobial resistance (AMR), is a growing risk to world health, making it more challenging to combat infectious health problems. The growth rate of bacteria is significantly influenced by temperature, particularly temperatures between 35 and 37{degrees}C, often considered the most suitable for the spread of human illnesses. Knowing that a rise in temperature influences bacterial growth rate, contributing to a higher infection rate, it is imperative to unravel and comprehend the association between climate change and the emergence of AMR. We hypothesized that rising temperatures could exacerbate the emergence of AMR in opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the global distribution of AMR and the correlation between AMR and socioeconomic factors, climate change, and air quality in the United States. The study found high resistance rates to common infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections are prevalent in many countries. In the United States, MRSA-AMR was more common in low-income states with increased poverty rates and poor air quality. The study also found a positive correlation between the rise in temperature over the past 10 years and AMR bacterial infections. The investigation concluded that socioeconomic factors, climate change, and race collectively impact the prevalence of AMR infections. The probability of AMR infection upsurging in the next decade was highest within states with more frequent rises in temperature over the last 10 years. The model predicted that states with at least 1 {degrees}C rise in temperature over the previous 10 years are expected to experience a surge in AMR bacterial infections in coming years. Though the statistical details might vary depending on the data collected in future, the correlation between climate change and the emergence of AMR in bacterial infection is alarming. The study indicates that climate change has an essential, largely unrecognized influence on AMR bacterial infections that warrants additional research. It implies that comprehensive and integrated strategies are needed to address the AMR and climate change challenges.\nEffect of the 2022 COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign in 50 year olds in England: regression discontinuity analysis in OpenSAFELY\nAuthors: Schaffer, A. L.; Hulme, W. J.; Horne, E. M. F.; Parker, E. P. K.; Walker, V.; Stables, C.; Mehrkar, A.; Bacon, S. C. J.; Bates, C.; Goldacre, B.; Walker, A. J.; The OpenSAFELY Collaborative, ; Hernan, M. A.; Sterne, J. A. C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.23295194\nBackgroundSARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19 but require boosting to maintain protection. Changes to circulating variants and prevalent natural immunity may impact on real-world effectiveness of boosters in different time periods and in different populations. MethodsWith NHS England approval, we used linked routine clinical data from \u003e24 million patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the 2022 combined COVID-19 autumn booster and influenza vaccine campaign in non-clinically vulnerable 50-year-olds in England using a regression discontinuity design. Our primary outcome was a composite of 6-week COVID-19 emergency attendance, COVID-19 unplanned hospitalisation, or death. The secondary outcomes were: respiratory hospitalisations or death; any unplanned hospitalisation; and any death. ResultsOur study included 1,917,375 people aged 45-54 years with no evidence of being in a high-risk group prioritised for vaccination. By 26 November 2022, booster vaccine coverage was 11.1% at age 49.75 years increasing to 39.7% at age 50.25 years. The estimated effect of the campaign on the risk of the primary outcome in 50-year-olds during weeks 7-12 after the campaign start was -0.4 per 100,000 (95% CI -7.8, 7.1). For the secondary outcomes the estimated effects were: -0.6 per 100,000 (95%CI -13.5, 12.3) for respiratory outcomes; 5.0 per 100,000 (95%CI -40.7, 50.8) for unplanned hospitalisations; and 3.0 per 100,000 (95%CI -2.7, 8.6) for any death. The results were similar when using different follow-up start dates, different bandwidths, or when estimating the effect of vaccination (rather than the campaign). ConclusionThis study found little evidence that the autumn 2022 vaccination campaign in England was associated with a reduction in severe COVID-19-related outcomes among non-clinically vulnerable 50-year-olds. Possible explanations include the low risk of severe outcomes due to substantial pre-existing vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. Modest booster coverage reduced the precision with which we could estimate effectiveness. The booster campaign may have had effects beyond those estimated, including reducing virus transmission and incidence of mild or moderate COVID-19.\nThe mediating role of mammographic density in the protective effect of early-life adiposity on breast cancer risk: a multivariable Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Vabistsevits, M.; Davey Smith, G.; Richardson, T. G.; Richmond, R. C.; Sieh, W.; Rothstein, J. H.; Habel, L. A.; Alexeeff, S.

Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR). We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD. Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA. In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.\nFrom Bimodal to Unimodal: The Transformed Incidence of Osteosarcoma in the United States\nAuthors: Kar, E.; Ammanamanchi, A.; Yousif, M.; Devi Geetha, S.; Schwartz, K.; Mishra, A.; Ling, J.; Nonyelu, K. N.; Kannadath, B. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.23294332\nBackgroundOsteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. It has classically been described as having a bimodal incidence by age, with the first peak in the second decade of life and the second peak after 65 years of age. We sought to identify whether the bimodal incidence distribution still exists for osteosarcoma using the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases. MethodsIncidence rates of osteosarcoma between 1975-2020 were analyzed by age, year of occurrence, sex, race, and primary tumor site using the SEER program data. The age of maximum incidence in patients 40 years of age and older was analyzed by calendar year to observe for a consistent second peak. Fishers Exact test was also conducted with the SEER data to assess if there was a significant association between the occurrence of osteosarcoma in patients 35-64 years old and those 65+ years old. Incidence of tumors of the long bones of the lower limbs using ICD-9 and 10 diagnosis codes from the NIS discharge database 2012-2019 were also analyzed for comparison. ResultsA total of 1,779 cases of osteosarcoma were reported in the SEER database from 1975-2020. Across the 46 calendar year span, a consistent first peak appeared in the second decade of life alternating between the 10-14 and 15-19 age groups. In the 40+ cohort, the age of the highest incidence varied widely each calendar year: being found in age groups 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, \u0026 85+ years old (5, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, \u0026 1 times respectively). For 25 years of the 46-year span, the max was shared by more than one age group. Overall, no single age group from the 40+ age group held a consistent maximum from 1975-2020. Using the NIS program and similar methodology, we analyzed 86,100 discharges of lower limb long bone tumors from 2012-2019 as a reference. The NIS data exhibited nearly identical patterns, with a unimodal incidence in adolescence and no obvious second peak. ConclusionOur analysis shows that the incidence of osteosarcoma is no longer bimodally distributed. This may be due to the increased use of bisphosphonates in recent years for the effective management of Pagets disease, leading to a decline in late-age bone tumors. Our findings suggest the need to update our understanding of the epidemiology of osteosarcoma, as it should be considered more as a disease of adolescence with only sporadic incidence later on in older age.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant.

MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported.

ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant).

ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: This study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 [&amp;ge;]1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure that is suspected to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is classroom ventilation. Methods: We established a community engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 rooms in the school, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results: 97% of rooms had an estimated ACH [&amp;le;]4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels [&amp;ge;]1,000 PPM for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [&amp;ge;]1,000 PPM and per-room SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed cases, accounting for 21% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community engaged research project. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 levels [&amp;ge;]1,000 PPM during the school day and SARS-CoV-2 cases in that room in an IDD school. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established.

ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{&#43;/-}7.8 years, 57% female.

ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data.

Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({&#43;/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{&#43;/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking.

ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality?

FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in &gt;88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk.

MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeWe aimed to use a large dataset to compare self-reported and primary care measures of insomnia symptom prevalence in England and establish whether they identify participants with similar characteristics.

MethodsWe analysed data from 163,748 UK Biobank participants in England (aged 38-71 at baseline) with linked primary care electronic health records. We compared the percentage of those self-reporting  usually having insomnia symptoms at UK Biobank baseline assessment (2006-2010) to those with a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records prior to baseline. We stratified prevalence in both groups by sociodemographic, lifestyle, sleep and health characteristics.

ResultsWe found that 29% of the sample self-reported having insomnia symptoms, whilst only 6% had a Read code for insomnia symptoms in their primary care records. Only 10% of self-reported cases had an insomnia symptom Read code, whilst 49% of primary care cases self-reported having insomnia symptoms. In both primary care and self-reported data, prevalence of insomnia symptom cases was highest in females, older participants and those with the lowest household incomes.

However, whilst snorers and risk takers were more likely to be a primary care case, they were less likely to self-report insomnia symptoms than non-snorers and non-risk takers.

ConclusionsOnly a small proportion of individuals experiencing insomnia symptoms present to primary care.

Plain Language SummaryAround a third of the general population is thought to suffer from insomnia symptoms, but estimates are based on the responses of a small number of people and rely on them reporting their own symptoms. Peoples medical records offer a more objective way of finding out how many people have insomnia, but only capture people who go to their doctor for help. In this study we compared 160,000 peoples answers to a question on insomnia symptoms to their primary care records. We found that 29% of people reported insomnia symptoms, whereas only 6% had insomnia symptoms recorded in their medical records. However, the characteristics of those reporting insomnia and those with insomnia in their medical records were similar. This means that although medical records only capture a small proportion of those suffering from insomnia, they do still provide useful information for researchers studying risk factors for insomnia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an &#34;explosion&#34; in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly &#34;boosted&#34; by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports &#34;a dramatic uptick&#34; in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution.

This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) &#34;increases&#34; or &#34;explosion&#34; might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009.

MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic.

ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an &#34;explosion&#34; in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM.

ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics, or antimicrobial resistance (AMR), is a growing risk to world health, making it more challenging to combat infectious health problems. The growth rate of bacteria is significantly influenced by temperature, particularly temperatures between 35 and 37{degrees}C, often considered the most suitable for the spread of human illnesses. Knowing that a rise in temperature influences bacterial growth rate, contributing to a higher infection rate, it is imperative to unravel and comprehend the association between climate change and the emergence of AMR. We hypothesized that rising temperatures could exacerbate the emergence of AMR in opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the global distribution of AMR and the correlation between AMR and socioeconomic factors, climate change, and air quality in the United States. The study found high resistance rates to common infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections are prevalent in many countries. In the United States, MRSA-AMR was more common in low-income states with increased poverty rates and poor air quality. The study also found a positive correlation between the rise in temperature over the past 10 years and AMR bacterial infections. The investigation concluded that socioeconomic factors, climate change, and race collectively impact the prevalence of AMR infections. The probability of AMR infection upsurging in the next decade was highest within states with more frequent rises in temperature over the last 10 years. The model predicted that states with at least 1 {degrees}C rise in temperature over the previous 10 years are expected to experience a surge in AMR bacterial infections in coming years. Though the statistical details might vary depending on the data collected in future, the correlation between climate change and the emergence of AMR in bacterial infection is alarming. The study indicates that climate change has an essential, largely unrecognized influence on AMR bacterial infections that warrants additional research. It implies that comprehensive and integrated strategies are needed to address the AMR and climate change challenges.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19 but require boosting to maintain protection. Changes to circulating variants and prevalent natural immunity may impact on real-world effectiveness of boosters in different time periods and in different populations.

MethodsWith NHS England approval, we used linked routine clinical data from &gt;24 million patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the 2022 combined COVID-19 autumn booster and influenza vaccine campaign in non-clinically vulnerable 50-year-olds in England using a regression discontinuity design. Our primary outcome was a composite of 6-week COVID-19 emergency attendance, COVID-19 unplanned hospitalisation, or death. The secondary outcomes were: respiratory hospitalisations or death; any unplanned hospitalisation; and any death.

ResultsOur study included 1,917,375 people aged 45-54 years with no evidence of being in a high-risk group prioritised for vaccination. By 26 November 2022, booster vaccine coverage was 11.1% at age 49.75 years increasing to 39.7% at age 50.25 years. The estimated effect of the campaign on the risk of the primary outcome in 50-year-olds during weeks 7-12 after the campaign start was -0.4 per 100,000 (95% CI -7.8, 7.1). For the secondary outcomes the estimated effects were: -0.6 per 100,000 (95%CI -13.5, 12.3) for respiratory outcomes; 5.0 per 100,000 (95%CI -40.7, 50.8) for unplanned hospitalisations; and 3.0 per 100,000 (95%CI -2.7, 8.6) for any death. The results were similar when using different follow-up start dates, different bandwidths, or when estimating the effect of vaccination (rather than the campaign).

ConclusionThis study found little evidence that the autumn 2022 vaccination campaign in England was associated with a reduction in severe COVID-19-related outcomes among non-clinically vulnerable 50-year-olds. Possible explanations include the low risk of severe outcomes due to substantial pre-existing vaccine- and infection-induced immunity. Modest booster coverage reduced the precision with which we could estimate effectiveness. The booster campaign may have had effects beyond those estimated, including reducing virus transmission and incidence of mild or moderate COVID-19.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Observational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR).

We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD.

Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA.

In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOsteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy. It has classically been described as having a bimodal incidence by age, with the first peak in the second decade of life and the second peak after 65 years of age. We sought to identify whether the bimodal incidence distribution still exists for osteosarcoma using the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases.

MethodsIncidence rates of osteosarcoma between 1975-2020 were analyzed by age, year of occurrence, sex, race, and primary tumor site using the SEER program data. The age of maximum incidence in patients 40 years of age and older was analyzed by calendar year to observe for a consistent second peak. Fishers Exact test was also conducted with the SEER data to assess if there was a significant association between the occurrence of osteosarcoma in patients 35-64 years old and those 65&#43; years old. Incidence of tumors of the long bones of the lower limbs using ICD-9 and 10 diagnosis codes from the NIS discharge database 2012-2019 were also analyzed for comparison.

ResultsA total of 1,779 cases of osteosarcoma were reported in the SEER database from 1975-2020. Across the 46 calendar year span, a consistent first peak appeared in the second decade of life alternating between the 10-14 and 15-19 age groups. In the 40&#43; cohort, the age of the highest incidence varied widely each calendar year: being found in age groups 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, &amp; 85&#43; years old (5, 3, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, &amp; 1 times respectively). For 25 years of the 46-year span, the max was shared by more than one age group. Overall, no single age group from the 40&#43; age group held a consistent maximum from 1975-2020.

Using the NIS program and similar methodology, we analyzed 86,100 discharges of lower limb long bone tumors from 2012-2019 as a reference. The NIS data exhibited nearly identical patterns, with a unimodal incidence in adolescence and no obvious second peak.

ConclusionOur analysis shows that the incidence of osteosarcoma is no longer bimodally distributed. This may be due to the increased use of bisphosphonates in recent years for the effective management of Pagets disease, leading to a decline in late-age bone tumors. Our findings suggest the need to update our understanding of the epidemiology of osteosarcoma, as it should be considered more as a disease of adolescence with only sporadic incidence later on in older age.</p>
