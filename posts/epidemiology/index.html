A.; Russell, T.; Rogers, T.; Lee, V. J.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298919\nEpidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions. SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.\nCharacterizing US spatial connectivity: implications for geographical disease dynamics and metapopulation modeling\nAuthors: Pullano, G.; Alvarez-Zuzek, L. G.; Colizza, V.; Bansal, S.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298916\nBackgroundHuman mobility is expected to be a critical factor in the geographic diffusion of infectious diseases, and this assumption led to the implementation of social distancing policies during the early fight against the COVID-19 emergency in the United States. Yet, because of substantial data gaps in the past, what still eludes our understanding are the following questions: 1) How does mobility contribute to the spread of infection within the United States at local, regional, and national scales? 2) How do seasonality and shifts in behavior affect mobility over time? 3) At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States? Addressing these questions is critical to developing accurate transmission models, predicting the spatial propagation of disease across scales, and understanding the optimal geographical and temporal scale for the implementation of control policies. MethodsWe address this problem using high-resolution human mobility data measured via mobile app usage. We compute the daily coupling network between US counties, and we integrate our mobility data into a spatially explicit transmission model to reproduce the national invasion of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the US. FindingsTemporally, we observe that intercounty connectivity is largely seasonal and was unperturbed by mobility restrictions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially, we identify 104 geographic clusters of US counties that are highly connected by mobility within the cluster and more sparsely connected to counties outside the cluster. These clusters are stable across time and highly overlap with US state boundaries. Together, these results suggest that intercounty connectivity in the US is relatively static across time and is homogeneous at the sub-state level. We also find that while having access to county-level, daily mobility data best captures the spatial invasion of disease, static mobility data aggregated to the scale of our mobility data-based clusters also performs well in capturing spatial diffusion of infection. InterpretationOur work demonstrates that intercounty mobility was negligibly affected outside the lockdown period of Spring 2020, explaining the broad spatial distribution of COVID-19 outbreaks in the US during the early phase of the pandemic. Such geographically dispersed outbreaks place a significant strain on national public health resources and necessitate complex metapopulation modeling approaches for predicting disease dynamics and control design. We thus inform the design of such metapopulation models to balance high disease predictability with low data requirements.\nSex differences in health-related quality of life and poverty risk among older people living with HIV in Spain: a cross-sectional study\nAuthors: Nuno, N.; Martinez, A.; Martinez, S.; Cobos, M.; Hernandez, J. S.; Polo, R.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299048\nBackgroundCurrent antiretroviral therapies have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). There is, however, limited evidence regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and living conditions of older people living with HIV (OPLHIV) in Spain. MethodsWe implemented a self-administered online questionnaire to identify sex differences in HRQoL and poverty risk among Spanish OPLHIV (PLHIV [\u0026ge;]50 years). Participants were contacted through non-governmental organisations. We used the standardised WHOQoL-HIV BREF questionnaire and the Europe 2020 guidelines to estimate HRQoL and poverty risk respectively. The statistical analysis included multivariable generalised linear models with potential confounding variables and robust estimates. ResultsThe study included 247 OPLHIV (192 men and 55 women). On the WHOQoL-HIV BREF questionnaire, men scored higher on 84% of items and in all six domains. Women had significantly lower HRQoL in five domains: physical health ({beta}: -1.5; 95% CI: -2.5, -0.5; p: 0.002), psychological health ({beta}: -1.0; 95% CI: -1.9, -0.1; p: 0.036), level of independence ({beta}: -1.1; 95% CI: -1.9, -0.2; p: 0.019), environmental health ({beta}: -1.1; 95% CI: -1.8, -0.3; p: 0.008), and spirituality/personal beliefs ({beta}: -1.4; 95% CI: -2.5, -0.3; p: 0.012). No statistical differences were found in the domain of social relations. Poverty risk was considerable for both men (30%) and women (53%), but women were significantly more likely to experience it (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 6.5; p: 0.009). ConclusionThe aging of PLHIV is a public health concern. Our findings indicate that HRQoL and poverty risk among Spanish OPLHIV differ significantly by sex. Spain should, therefore, implement specific policies and interventions to address OPLHIV needs. The strategies must place a high priority on the reduction of sex inequalities in HRQoL and the enhancement of the structural conditions in which OPLHIV live.\nASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: RESULTS FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT\nAuthors: Sekendiz, Z.; Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Carr, M. A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1181.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nPopulation age as a key factor in the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics\nAuthors: Nesteruk, I.; Keeling, M.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299229\nThe population and governments of many countries are losing interest in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of tests and the number of new cases detected is sharply decreasing. To compare the accumulated numbers CC of cases and deaths DC per million and to answer the question why the less vaccinated Africa has accumulated 36 times lower CC values and 15 times lower DC values than Europe, simple statistical analysis have been performed. CC and DC values demonstrated rather strong correlation with the median age of populations. One-year increment in the median year yields 12-18 thousand increase in CC values and 52-83 increase in DC values. Zero-COVID countries succeed to have much lower numbers of deaths per capita and case fatality ratios DC/CC.\nAssociation between late-life air pollution exposure and medial temporal lobe atrophy in older women\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Salminen, L. E.; Petkus, A. J.; Driscoll, I.; Millstein, J.; Beavers, D. P.; Espeland, M. A.; Erus, G.; Braskie, M. N.; Thompson, P. M.; Gatz, M.; Chui, H. C.; Resnick, S. M.; Kaufman, J. D.; Rapp, S. R.; Shumaker, S.; Brown, M.; Younan, D.; Chen, J.-C.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23298708\nBackgroundAmbient air pollution exposures increase risk for Alzheimers disease (AD) and related dementias, possibly due to structural changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). However, existing MRI studies examining exposure effects on the MTL were cross-sectional and focused on the hippocampus, yielding mixed results. MethodTo determine whether air pollution exposures were associated with MTL atrophy over time, we conducted a longitudinal study including 653 cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older women from the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study with two MRI brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-6; MRI-2: 2009-10; Mage at MRI-1=77.3{+/-}3.5years). Using regionalized universal kriging models, exposures at residential locations were estimated as 3-year annual averages of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) prior to MRI-1. Bilateral gray matter volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) were summed to operationalize the MTL. We used linear regressions to estimate exposure effects on 5-year volume changes in the MTL and its subregions, adjusting for intracranial volume, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. ResultsOn average, MTL volume decreased by 0.53{+/-}1.00cm3 over 5 years. For each interquartile increase of PM2.5 (3.26{micro}g/m3) and NO2 (6.77ppb), adjusted MTL volume had greater shrinkage by 0.32cm3 (95%CI=[-0.43,-0.21]) and 0.12cm3 (95%CI=[-0.22,-0.01]), respectively. The exposure effects did not differ by APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype, sociodemographic, and cardiovascular risk factors, and remained among women with low-level PM2.5 exposure. Greater PHG atrophy was associated with higher PM2.5 (b=-0.24, 95%CI=[-0.29,-0.19]) and NO2 exposures (b=-0.09, 95%CI=[-0.14,-0.04]). Higher exposure to PM2.5 but not NO2 was also associated with greater ERC atrophy. Exposures were not associated with amygdala or hippocampal atrophy. ConclusionIn summary, higher late-life PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with greater MTL atrophy over time in cognitively unimpaired older women. The PHG and ERC - the MTL cortical subregions where AD neuropathologies likely begin, may be preferentially vulnerable to air pollution neurotoxicity.

J.; Volk, H. E.; Nitta, M. M.; Feinberg, J. I.; Newschaffer, C. J.; Croen, L. A.; Hertz-Picciotto, I.; Fallin, M. D.; Bakulski, K. M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.23298827\nBackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Risk is attributed to genetic and prenatal environmental factors, though the environmental agents are incompletely characterized. MethodsIn Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two pregnancy cohorts with high likelihood of ASD, maternal urinary metals concentrations at two time points during pregnancy were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At age three, clinicians assessed ASD with DSM-5 criteria. Using multivariable log binomial regression, we examined each metal for association with ASD status, adjusting for gestational age at urine sampling, child sex, maternal age, and maternal education, and meta-analyzed across the two cohorts. ResultsIn EARLI (n=170) 17.6% of children were diagnosed with ASD, and an additional 43.5% were classified as having other non-neurotypical development (Non-TD). In MARBLES (n=156), 22.7% were diagnosed with ASD, while an additional 11.5% had Non-TD. In earlier pregnancy metals measures, having cadmium concentration over the level of detection was associated with 1.78 (1.19, 2.67) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.43 (1.06, 1.92) times higher risk of Non-TD. A doubling of early pregnancy cesium concentration was marginally associated with 1.81 (0.95, 3.42) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.58 (0.95, 2.63) times higher risk of Non- TD. ConclusionExposure in utero to elevated levels of cadmium and cesium, as measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy, was associated with increased risk of developing ASD.\nIncidence, prevalence, and survival of breast cancer in the United Kingdom from 2000-2021: a population-based cohort study\nAuthors: Barclay, N. L.; Burn, E. L.; Delmestri, A.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Golazar, A.; Man, W. Y.; Tan, E. H.; Tietzova, I.; OPTIMA Consortium, ; PRIETO-ALHAMBRA, D.; Newby, D.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.23299179\nBackgroundBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in females globally. However, we know relatively little about trends in males. This study describes UK secular trends in breast cancer from 2000-2021 for both sexes. MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database and validated in Aurum. There were 5848436 eligible females and 5539681 males aged 18+ years, with [\u0026ge;]one year of prior data availability in the study period. We estimated breast cancer incidence rates (IR), period prevalence (PP) and survival at one-, five- and 10-years after diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses were further stratified by age. ResultsIR of breast cancer from 2000-2021 was 194.4 per 100000 person-years for females and 1.16 for males. PP in 2021 was 2.1% for females and 0.009% for males. Both sexes have seen around a 2.5-fold increase in PP across time. Incidence increased with age for both sexes, peaking in females aged 60-69 years and males 90+. There was a drop in incidence for females aged 70-79 years. From 2003-2019, incidence increased \u003e2-fold in younger females (aged 18-29: IR 2.12 in 2003 vs. 4.58 in 2018); decreased in females aged 50-69 years; and further declined from 2015 onwards in females aged 70-89 years. Survival for females after one-, five-, and ten-years after diagnosis was 95.1%, 80.2%, and 68.4%, and for males 92.9%, 69.0%, and 51.3%. Survival at one-year increased by 2.08% points, and survival at five years increased by 5.39% from 2000-2004 to 2015-2019 for females, particularly those aged 50-70 years. For males, there were no clear time-trends for short-term and long-term survival. ConclusionChanges in incidence of breast cancer in females largely reflect the success of screening programmes, as rates rise and fall in synchronicity with ages of eligibility for such programmes. Overall survival from breast cancer for females has improved from 2000 to 2021, again reflecting the success of screening programmes, early diagnosis, and improvements in treatments. Male breast cancer patients have worse survival outcomes compared to females, highlighting the need to develop male-specific diagnosis and treatment strategies to improve long-term survival in line with females.\nAssessing the Impact of Mask Mandates on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission: A Case Study of Utah\nAuthors: Horn, A. C.; Shoemaker, H. E.; Keegan, L. T.\nScore: 139.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298464\nBackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1. MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions.

We aimed to assess the performance of newly developed and existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomic age models for prediction of chronological age (CA), mortality, and age-related disease. 98 metabolic variables were measured in blood from nine UK and Finnish cohort studies (N {approx} 31,000 individuals, age range 24-86 years). We used non-linear and penalised regression to model CA and time to all-cause mortality. We examined associations of four new and two previously published metabolomic age models, with ageing risk factors and phenotypes. Within the UK Biobank (N{approx} 102,000), we tested prediction of CA, incident disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and all-cause mortality. Cross-validated Pearsons r between metabolomic age models and CA ranged between 0.47-0.65 in the training set (mean absolute error: 8-9 years). Metabolomic age models, adjusted for CA, were associated with C-reactive protein, and inversely associated with glomerular filtration rate. Positively associated risk factors included obesity, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In UK Biobank, correlations of metabolomic age with chronological age were modest (r = 0.29-0.33), yet all metabolomic model scores predicted mortality (hazard ratios of 1.01 to 1.06 / metabolomic age year) and CVD, after adjustment for CA. While metabolomic age models were only moderately associated with CA in an independent population, they provided additional prediction of morbidity and mortality over CA itself, suggesting their wider applicability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Epidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised. We address this by assessing dynamic networks across varied social settings and developing a novel metric to measure contact retention over time and to identify highly connected individuals. Using 11 networks from 5 settings studied over 3-10 days, we estimated that more than 80% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for only short periods. This suggests a challenge to identify superspreaders, and more individuals would need to be targeted as part of outbreak interventions to achieve the same reduction in transmission as predicted from a static network. Taking into account repeated contacts over multiple days, we estimated simple resource planning models might overestimate the number of contacts made by an infector by 20%-70%. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department accounted for most of the retained contacts. Hence, outbreak control measures would be better off targeting specific sub-populations in these settings to reduce transmission. In contrast, no obvious type of contact dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, so reducing the risk of disease introduction is critical to avoid disrupting the interdependent work functions.

SignificanceDirectly transmitted infectious diseases spread through social contacts that can change over time. Simplifying these contact patterns when predicting outbreaks with models may bias results, and in turn conclusions on the effectiveness of control measures. An ongoing challenge is therefore how to capture key properties of complex and dynamic networks while also ensuring analysis is transparent and interpretable. To address this challenge, we analysed 11 networks from 5 different settings and developed new metrics to capture crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We showed that there is an inherent difficulty in identifying individual  superspreaders reliably in most networks. In addition, the key types of individuals driving transmission vary across settings, thus requiring different outbreak control measures to reduce disease transmission or the risk of introduction. Simple models to mimic disease transmission in temporal networks may not capture the repeated contacts over the days, and hence could incorrectly estimate the resources required for outbreak control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHuman mobility is expected to be a critical factor in the geographic diffusion of infectious diseases, and this assumption led to the implementation of social distancing policies during the early fight against the COVID-19 emergency in the United States. Yet, because of substantial data gaps in the past, what still eludes our understanding are the following questions: 1) How does mobility contribute to the spread of infection within the United States at local, regional, and national scales? 2) How do seasonality and shifts in behavior affect mobility over time? 3) At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States? Addressing these questions is critical to developing accurate transmission models, predicting the spatial propagation of disease across scales, and understanding the optimal geographical and temporal scale for the implementation of control policies.

MethodsWe address this problem using high-resolution human mobility data measured via mobile app usage. We compute the daily coupling network between US counties, and we integrate our mobility data into a spatially explicit transmission model to reproduce the national invasion of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.

FindingsTemporally, we observe that intercounty connectivity is largely seasonal and was unperturbed by mobility restrictions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatially, we identify 104 geographic clusters of US counties that are highly connected by mobility within the cluster and more sparsely connected to counties outside the cluster. These clusters are stable across time and highly overlap with US state boundaries. Together, these results suggest that intercounty connectivity in the US is relatively static across time and is homogeneous at the sub-state level. We also find that while having access to county-level, daily mobility data best captures the spatial invasion of disease, static mobility data aggregated to the scale of our mobility data-based clusters also performs well in capturing spatial diffusion of infection.

InterpretationOur work demonstrates that intercounty mobility was negligibly affected outside the lockdown period of Spring 2020, explaining the broad spatial distribution of COVID-19 outbreaks in the US during the early phase of the pandemic. Such geographically dispersed outbreaks place a significant strain on national public health resources and necessitate complex metapopulation modeling approaches for predicting disease dynamics and control design. We thus inform the design of such metapopulation models to balance high disease predictability with low data requirements.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCurrent antiretroviral therapies have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV). There is, however, limited evidence regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and living conditions of older people living with HIV (OPLHIV) in Spain.

MethodsWe implemented a self-administered online questionnaire to identify sex differences in HRQoL and poverty risk among Spanish OPLHIV (PLHIV [&amp;ge;]50 years). Participants were contacted through non-governmental organisations. We used the standardised WHOQoL-HIV BREF questionnaire and the Europe 2020 guidelines to estimate HRQoL and poverty risk respectively. The statistical analysis included multivariable generalised linear models with potential confounding variables and robust estimates.

ResultsThe study included 247 OPLHIV (192 men and 55 women). On the WHOQoL-HIV BREF questionnaire, men scored higher on 84% of items and in all six domains. Women had significantly lower HRQoL in five domains: physical health ({beta}: -1.5; 95% CI: -2.5, -0.5; p: 0.002), psychological health ({beta}: -1.0; 95% CI: -1.9, -0.1; p: 0.036), level of independence ({beta}: -1.1; 95% CI: -1.9, -0.2; p: 0.019), environmental health ({beta}: -1.1; 95% CI: -1.8, -0.3; p: 0.008), and spirituality/personal beliefs ({beta}: -1.4; 95% CI: -2.5, -0.3; p: 0.012). No statistical differences were found in the domain of social relations. Poverty risk was considerable for both men (30%) and women (53%), but women were significantly more likely to experience it (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 6.5; p: 0.009).

ConclusionThe aging of PLHIV is a public health concern. Our findings indicate that HRQoL and poverty risk among Spanish OPLHIV differ significantly by sex. Spain should, therefore, implement specific policies and interventions to address OPLHIV needs. The strategies must place a high priority on the reduction of sex inequalities in HRQoL and the enhancement of the structural conditions in which OPLHIV live.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The population and governments of many countries are losing interest in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of tests and the number of new cases detected is sharply decreasing. To compare the accumulated numbers CC of cases and deaths DC per million and to answer the question why the less vaccinated Africa has accumulated 36 times lower CC values and 15 times lower DC values than Europe, simple statistical analysis have been performed. CC and DC values demonstrated rather strong correlation with the median age of populations. One-year increment in the median year yields 12-18 thousand increase in CC values and 52-83 increase in DC values. Zero-COVID countries succeed to have much lower numbers of deaths per capita and case fatality ratios DC/CC.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAmbient air pollution exposures increase risk for Alzheimers disease (AD) and related dementias, possibly due to structural changes in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). However, existing MRI studies examining exposure effects on the MTL were cross-sectional and focused on the hippocampus, yielding mixed results.

MethodTo determine whether air pollution exposures were associated with MTL atrophy over time, we conducted a longitudinal study including 653 cognitively unimpaired community-dwelling older women from the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study with two MRI brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-6; MRI-2: 2009-10; Mage at MRI-1=77.3{&#43;/-}3.5years). Using regionalized universal kriging models, exposures at residential locations were estimated as 3-year annual averages of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) prior to MRI-1. Bilateral gray matter volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and entorhinal cortex (ERC) were summed to operationalize the MTL. We used linear regressions to estimate exposure effects on 5-year volume changes in the MTL and its subregions, adjusting for intracranial volume, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics.

ResultsOn average, MTL volume decreased by 0.53{&#43;/-}1.00cm3 over 5 years. For each interquartile increase of PM2.5 (3.26{micro}g/m3) and NO2 (6.77ppb), adjusted MTL volume had greater shrinkage by 0.32cm3 (95%CI=[-0.43,-0.21]) and 0.12cm3 (95%CI=[-0.22,-0.01]), respectively. The exposure effects did not differ by APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype, sociodemographic, and cardiovascular risk factors, and remained among women with low-level PM2.5 exposure. Greater PHG atrophy was associated with higher PM2.5 (b=-0.24, 95%CI=[-0.29,-0.19]) and NO2 exposures (b=-0.09, 95%CI=[-0.14,-0.04]). Higher exposure to PM2.5 but not NO2 was also associated with greater ERC atrophy. Exposures were not associated with amygdala or hippocampal atrophy.

ConclusionIn summary, higher late-life PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with greater MTL atrophy over time in cognitively unimpaired older women. The PHG and ERC - the MTL cortical subregions where AD neuropathologies likely begin, may be preferentially vulnerable to air pollution neurotoxicity.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Risk is attributed to genetic and prenatal environmental factors, though the environmental agents are incompletely characterized.

MethodsIn Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two pregnancy cohorts with high likelihood of ASD, maternal urinary metals concentrations at two time points during pregnancy were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At age three, clinicians assessed ASD with DSM-5 criteria. Using multivariable log binomial regression, we examined each metal for association with ASD status, adjusting for gestational age at urine sampling, child sex, maternal age, and maternal education, and meta-analyzed across the two cohorts.

ResultsIn EARLI (n=170) 17.6% of children were diagnosed with ASD, and an additional 43.5% were classified as having other non-neurotypical development (Non-TD). In MARBLES (n=156), 22.7% were diagnosed with ASD, while an additional 11.5% had Non-TD. In earlier pregnancy metals measures, having cadmium concentration over the level of detection was associated with 1.78 (1.19, 2.67) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.43 (1.06, 1.92) times higher risk of Non-TD. A doubling of early pregnancy cesium concentration was marginally associated with 1.81 (0.95, 3.42) times higher risk of ASD, and 1.58 (0.95, 2.63) times higher risk of Non- TD.

ConclusionExposure in utero to elevated levels of cadmium and cesium, as measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy, was associated with increased risk of developing ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in females globally. However, we know relatively little about trends in males. This study describes UK secular trends in breast cancer from 2000-2021 for both sexes.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database and validated in Aurum. There were 5848436 eligible females and 5539681 males aged 18&#43; years, with [&amp;ge;]one year of prior data availability in the study period. We estimated breast cancer incidence rates (IR), period prevalence (PP) and survival at one-, five- and 10-years after diagnosis using the Kaplan-Meier method. Analyses were further stratified by age.

ResultsIR of breast cancer from 2000-2021 was 194.4 per 100000 person-years for females and 1.16 for males. PP in 2021 was 2.1% for females and 0.009% for males. Both sexes have seen around a 2.5-fold increase in PP across time. Incidence increased with age for both sexes, peaking in females aged 60-69 years and males 90&#43;. There was a drop in incidence for females aged 70-79 years. From 2003-2019, incidence increased &gt;2-fold in younger females (aged 18-29: IR 2.12 in 2003 vs. 4.58 in 2018); decreased in females aged 50-69 years; and further declined from 2015 onwards in females aged 70-89 years. Survival for females after one-, five-, and ten-years after diagnosis was 95.1%, 80.2%, and 68.4%, and for males 92.9%, 69.0%, and 51.3%. Survival at one-year increased by 2.08% points, and survival at five years increased by 5.39% from 2000-2004 to 2015-2019 for females, particularly those aged 50-70 years. For males, there were no clear time-trends for short-term and long-term survival.

ConclusionChanges in incidence of breast cancer in females largely reflect the success of screening programmes, as rates rise and fall in synchronicity with ages of eligibility for such programmes. Overall survival from breast cancer for females has improved from 2000 to 2021, again reflecting the success of screening programmes, early diagnosis, and improvements in treatments. Male breast cancer patients have worse survival outcomes compared to females, highlighting the need to develop male-specific diagnosis and treatment strategies to improve long-term survival in line with females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1.

MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.

ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.

ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolomic age models have been proposed for the study of biological aging, however they have not been widely validated. We aimed to assess the performance of newly developed and existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomic age models for prediction of chronological age (CA), mortality, and age-related disease.

98 metabolic variables were measured in blood from nine UK and Finnish cohort studies (N {approx} 31,000 individuals, age range 24-86 years). We used non-linear and penalised regression to model CA and time to all-cause mortality. We examined associations of four new and two previously published metabolomic age models, with ageing risk factors and phenotypes. Within the UK Biobank (N{approx} 102,000), we tested prediction of CA, incident disease (cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and all-cause mortality.

Cross-validated Pearsons r between metabolomic age models and CA ranged between 0.47-0.65 in the training set (mean absolute error: 8-9 years). Metabolomic age models, adjusted for CA, were associated with C-reactive protein, and inversely associated with glomerular filtration rate. Positively associated risk factors included obesity, diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In UK Biobank, correlations of metabolomic age with chronological age were modest (r = 0.29-0.33), yet all metabolomic model scores predicted mortality (hazard ratios of 1.01 to 1.06 / metabolomic age year) and CVD, after adjustment for CA.

While metabolomic age models were only moderately associated with CA in an independent population, they provided additional prediction of morbidity and mortality over CA itself, suggesting their wider applicability.</p>
