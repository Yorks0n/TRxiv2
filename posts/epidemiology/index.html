T.; Mukherjee, B.\nScore: 61.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291692\nBackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear. MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset. ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death). Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome. ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.\nSpatial and temporal clustering of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats, 2021- 2023\nAuthors: Chen, C.; Martins, M.; Yettapu, D.; Diel, D.; Jennifer, R.; Urbasic, A.; Robinson, H.; Varga, C.; Fang, Y.\nScore: 31.0, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.23291564\nIn this study, we evaluated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats from October 2021 to May 2023. Among 1,715 samples tested by serological assays, 244 samples (14%) tested positive. High-rate temporal, spatial, and space-time clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were assessed within 63 counties in Illinois. Three space-time clusters with higher than expected seroprevalence rates were identified in the northeastern, central-east, and southwest regions of Illinois, occurring between June and October 2022. Young cats had a higher rate of seropositivity compared to older cats, and the third quarter of the year had the highest seropositivity rate. This study provides an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Illinois household cats, which will aid in COVID-19 control and prevention. Article summary lineSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was assessed in Illinois domestic cats, in which a higher seropositivity rate was clustered in the northern, central, and southern Illinois regions with peak periods occurring between June and October 2022.\nEstimating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalisation and death: a cohort study based on the 2021 Census, England.\nAuthors: Bermingham, C.; Nafilyan, V.; Andrews, N.; Gethings, O.\nScore: 120.6, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23290982\nObjectiveTo estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against hospitalisation for COVID-19 and death involving COVID-19 in England using linked population level data sources including the 2021 Census. DesignRetrospective cohort study. SettingEngland, 21 March 2021 to 20 March 2022. ParticipantsIndividuals alive and aged 16+ on 21 March 2021, resident in England, enumerated in the 2021 Census as a usual resident, and able to link to an NHS number. A sample of 583,840 individuals was used for the analysis. ExposuresCOVID-19 vaccination: first dose, second dose and third dose/first booster dose, with categories for time since each dose. Main outcome measuresHospitalisation for COVID-19 or death involving COVID-19. An adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio for the outcomes for vaccinated participants for different doses and time since dose compared to unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1-hazard ratio)x100%. A control outcome of non-COVID-19 death was also assessed. ResultsVaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 52.1% (95% confidence interval 51.3% to 52.8%) for a first dose, 55.6% (55.2% to 56.1%) for a second dose and 77.6% (77.3% to 78.0%) for a third dose, with a decrease in vaccine effectiveness 3+ months after the third dose. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality was 58.7% (52.7% to 63.9%) for a first dose, 88.5% (87.5% to 89.5%) for a second dose and 93.2% (92.9% to 93.5%) for a third dose, with evidence of waning 3+ months after the second and third doses. For the second dose, which is the most comparable across the different time-periods, vaccine effectiveness was higher against COVID-19 hospitalisation but slightly lower against COVID-19 mortality in the Omicron dominant period than the period before the Omicron variant became dominant. Vaccine effectiveness against both COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality was higher in general for mRNA vaccines than non mRNA vaccines, however this could be influenced by the different populations given each vaccine vector. Non-zero VE against non-COVID-19 mortality indicates that residual confounding may impact the results, despite the inclusion of up-to-date socio-demographic adjustments and various sources of health data, with possible frailty bias, confounding by indication and a healthy vaccinee effect observed. ConclusionsThe vaccine effectiveness estimates show increased protection with number of doses and a high level of protection against both COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality for the third/booster dose, as would be expected from previous research. However, despite the various sources of health data used to adjust the models, the estimates for different breakdowns and for non-COVID-19 mortality expose residual confounding by health status, which should be considered when interpreting estimates of vaccine effectiveness.\nHistory of incarceration and age-related cognitive impairment: Testing models of genetic and environmental risk in longitudinal panel study of older adults.\nAuthors: Tanksley, P. T.; Logan, M. W.; Barnes, J. C.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291910\nHistory of incarceration is associated with an excess of morbidity and mortality. While the incarceration experience itself comes with substantive health risks (e.g., injury, psychological stress, exposure to infectious disease), most inmates eventually return to the general population where they will be diagnosed with the same age-related conditions that drive mortality in the non-incarcerated population but at exaggerated rates. However, the interplay between history of incarceration as a risk factor and more traditional risk factors for age-related diseases (e.g., genetic risk factors) has not been studied. Here, we focus on cognitive impairment, a hallmark of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers disease, as an age-related state that may be uniquely impacted by the confluence of environmental stressors (e.g., incarceration) and genetic risk factors. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we found that incarceration and APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype (i.e., the chief genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease) both constituted substantive risk factors for cognitive impairment in terms of overall risk and earlier onset. The observed effects were mutually independent, however, suggesting that the risk conveyed by incarceration and APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype operate across different risk pathways. Our results have implications for the study of criminal justice contact as a public health risk factor for age-related, neurodegenerative conditions.\nSimultaneous detection and quantification of multiple enteric pathogen targets in wastewater\nAuthors: Rao, G.; Capone, D.; Zhu, K.; Knoble, A.; Linden, Y.; Clark, R.; Lai, A.; Kim, J.; Huang, C.-H.; Bivins, A.; Brown, J.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291792\nWastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a critical tool for public health surveillance, building on decades of environmental surveillance work for pathogens such as poliovirus. Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.\nPatient characteristics associated with clinically coded long COVID: an OpenSAFELY study using electronic health records\nAuthors: Wei, Y.; Horne, E. M. F.; Knight, R.; Cezard, G.; Walker, A. J.; Fisher, L.; Denholm, R.; Taylor, K.; Walker, V.; Riley, S.; Williams, D. M.; Willans, R. J.; Davy, S.; Bacon, S.; Goldacre, B. J.; Mehrkar-Asl, A.-R.; Denaxas, S.; Greaves, F.; Silverwood, R.; Sheikh, A.; Chaturvedi, N.; Wood, A.; Macleod, J.; Steves, C.; Sterne, J. A. C.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291776\nDespite reports of post-COVID-19 syndromes (long COVID) are rising, clinically coded long COVID cases are incomplete in electronic health records. It is unclear how patient characteristics may be associated with clinically coded long COVID. With the approval of NHS England, we undertook a cohort study using electronic health records within the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform in England, to study patient characteristics associated with clinically coded long COVID from 29 January 2020 to 31 March 2022. We estimated age-sex adjusted hazard ratios and fully adjusted hazard ratios for coded long COVID. Patient characteristics included demographic factors, and health behavioural and clinical factors. Among 17,986,419 adults, 36,886 (0.21%) were clinically coded with long COVID. Patient characteristics associated with coded long COVID included female sex, younger age (under 60 years), obesity, living in less deprived areas, ever smoking, greater consultation frequency, and history of diagnosed asthma, mental health conditions, pre-pandemic post-viral fatigue, or psoriasis. The strength of these associations was attenuated following two-dose vaccination compared to before vaccination. The incidence of coded long COVID was higher after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. These results should be interpreted with caution given that long COVID was likely under-recorded in electronic health records.\nComparison of control and transmission of COVID-19 across epidemic waves in Hong Kong: an observational study\nAuthors: Yang, B.; Lin, Y.; Xiong, W.; Liu, C.; Gao, H.; Ho, F.; Zhou, J.; Zhang, R.; Wong, J.; Cheung, J.; Lau, E.; Tsang, T.; Xiao, J.; Wong, I.; Martin-Sanchez, M.; Leung, G.; Cowling, B. J.; Wu, P.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291593\nBackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter. MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults. FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (\u003e70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [\u0026ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks. InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.\nEpidemiology of Atrial Fibrillation in Colombia 2010-2015.\nAuthors: Miranda, P.; Guzman, R.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291899\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. Its prevalence worldwide has doubled in the last decade due to increased capacity for diagnosis and management of heart disease and chronic non-cardiac. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence, incidence and demand for treatment of AF in Colombia during the period 2010 to 2015.\nDescribing the landscape of nutrition or diet-related randomised controlled trials: meta-research study of protocols published between 2012 and 2022\nAuthors: Silva, F. M.; Adegboye, A. R. A.; Curioni, C.; Gomes, F.; Kac, G.; Collins, G. S.; Cook, J.; Ismail, L. C.; Page, M. J.; Khandpur, N.; Lamb, S. S.; Hopewell, S.; Saleh, S.; Kirtley, S.; Bernardes, S.; Durao, S.; Vorland, C. J.; Schussel, M. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.08.23291109\nBackground \u0026 AimsThe landscape of nutrition research has changed over the past decades. We aimed to map the landscape of nutrition or diet-related interventions research, using data from randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocols published in the last decade. MethodsThis meta-research study examined nutrition or diet-related RCT protocols published in journals indexed in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, PsycINFO, or the Global Health Database between January/2012 and March/2022. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts to check eligibility and one reviewer extracted bibliometric information, study characteristics, and research transparency practices such as protocol registration, conflicts of interest and funding disclosure. We also screened the \"Instructions for Authors\" of journals with publications in our sample to check for endorsement of SPIRIT, TIDieR, and CONSORT reporting guidelines, and we checked if the authors mentioned these reporting guidelines in their paper. ResultsThe search retrieved 62,319 records, of which 1,068 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The number of published RCT protocols increased annually between 2012 and 2022, with a mean of 161 (range: 155-163) publications/ year. The USA (n = 165; 15.5%) and Australia (n = 137; 12.8%) published the largest number of protocols. Protocols were published in 148 journals, mainly medical journals (n = 518; 48.5%). Among these journals, 50 (33.8%) endorsed SPIRIT, 111 (75.3%) endorsed CONSORT, and four (2.7%) endorsed TIDieR. In 343 (32.1%) publications the authors mentioned SPIRIT, in 297 (27.8%) CONSORT was mentioned, while 20 (1.9%) mentioned TIDieR. Most protocols reported the RCT registration number (n = 1,006; 94.2%) and included statements about conflicts of interest (n = 952; 89.1%) and funding (n = 994; 93.2%). More than one third of protocols focused on adults and elderly participants (n = 350; 32.7%) and most protocols included participants with a specific clinical condition (n = 726; 68.0%). A single nutrition or diet-related intervention (n = 724; 67.8%) was described in most protocols, with \"supplementation, supplements or fortification\" (n = 405; 37.9%) and \"nutrition education, counseling or coordination of care\" (n = 354; 33.1%) being the most frequent types of interventions studied. The most frequent primary outcomes reported were related to clinical status (n = 308; 28.8%), nutritional status (n = 247; 23.1%), and frequency or severity of disease (n = 238; 22.3%). The majority of protocols described a single-centre study (n = 838; 78.5%), with two-arms (n = 844; 79.1%), parallel (n = 1014; 94.9%) design, with a superiority framework (n = 755; 70.7%). ConclusionsThe number of protocols on nutrition or diet-related trials being published is increasing, indicating the importance of this type of publication. The mention of relevant reporting guidelines by both researchers and journals remains far from ideal. Most protocols assessed supplementation or fortification and nutrition education, counselling or coordination of care interventions, among adults and the elderly.\nMortality associated with influenza and Omicron infections in France and vaccination of healthcare workers in nursing homes\nAuthors: Goldstein, E.\nScore: 34.4, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290994\nBackground: During the winter of 2022-2023, high rates of all-cause mortality, not seen since April 2020, were recorded in France, with excess all-cause mortality being related to the Omicron and influenza epidemics during that period. Moreover, that period saw a significant increase in the proportion of residents in long-term care facilities among cases of death in the population. Studies have found that increased influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers can result in a substantial reduction (up to 20%-30% during the course of select influenza seasons in the pre-pandemic period) in all-cause mortality in residents in nursing homes. Methods: We applied the previously developed methodology to estimate the contribution of influenza infections to all-cause mortality in France for the 2014-2015 through the 2018-2019 influenza seasons, and the contribution of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections to all-cause mortality between week 33, 2022 through week 12, 2023. Results: For the 2014-2015 through the 2018-2019 seasons, influenza was associated with an average of 15654 (95% CI (13013,18340)) deaths, while between week 33, 2022 through week 12, 2023, we estimated 7851 (5213,10463) influenza-associated deaths and 32607 (20794,44496) SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths. The number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths during the Omicron epidemic was significantly higher than the number of deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate or the hospitalization record; for example, between weeks 33-52 in 2022, we estimated 23983 (15307,32620) SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in France, compared with 12811 deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, and 8639 in-hospital deaths with COVID-19 during the same period. Examination of US mortality data suggests a significant contribution of Omicron infections to mortality for cardiac disease and mental/behavioral disorders with COVID-19 not listed on the death certificate. Conclusions: Our results suggest the need for boosting influenza vaccination coverage in different population groups (including healthcare workers, particularly nurse assistants for whom influenza vaccination coverage rates in France are low), as well as for wider use of influenza antiviral medications in influenza-related respiratory hospitalizations with different diagnoses (including pneumonia). Wider detection and treatment of Omicron infections, particularly in older individuals/persons with underlying health conditions such as cardiac disease and mental/behavioral disorders, and wider use of bivalent COVID-19 boosters would be needed in the event of the recrudescence of Omicron circulation in France.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear.

MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset.

ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death).

Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome.

ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this study, we evaluated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Illinois household cats from October 2021 to May 2023. Among 1,715 samples tested by serological assays, 244 samples (14%) tested positive. High-rate temporal, spatial, and space-time clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases were assessed within 63 counties in Illinois. Three space-time clusters with higher than expected seroprevalence rates were identified in the northeastern, central-east, and southwest regions of Illinois, occurring between June and October 2022. Young cats had a higher rate of seropositivity compared to older cats, and the third quarter of the year had the highest seropositivity rate. This study provides an in-depth analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in Illinois household cats, which will aid in COVID-19 control and prevention.

Article summary lineSARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was assessed in Illinois domestic cats, in which a higher seropositivity rate was clustered in the northern, central, and southern Illinois regions with peak periods occurring between June and October 2022.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against hospitalisation for COVID-19 and death involving COVID-19 in England using linked population level data sources including the 2021 Census.

DesignRetrospective cohort study.

SettingEngland, 21 March 2021 to 20 March 2022.

ParticipantsIndividuals alive and aged 16&#43; on 21 March 2021, resident in England, enumerated in the 2021 Census as a usual resident, and able to link to an NHS number. A sample of 583,840 individuals was used for the analysis.

ExposuresCOVID-19 vaccination: first dose, second dose and third dose/first booster dose, with categories for time since each dose.

Main outcome measuresHospitalisation for COVID-19 or death involving COVID-19. An adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio for the outcomes for vaccinated participants for different doses and time since dose compared to unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1-hazard ratio)x100%. A control outcome of non-COVID-19 death was also assessed.

ResultsVaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 52.1% (95% confidence interval 51.3% to 52.8%) for a first dose, 55.6% (55.2% to 56.1%) for a second dose and 77.6% (77.3% to 78.0%) for a third dose, with a decrease in vaccine effectiveness 3&#43; months after the third dose.

Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality was 58.7% (52.7% to 63.9%) for a first dose, 88.5% (87.5% to 89.5%) for a second dose and 93.2% (92.9% to 93.5%) for a third dose, with evidence of waning 3&#43; months after the second and third doses.

For the second dose, which is the most comparable across the different time-periods, vaccine effectiveness was higher against COVID-19 hospitalisation but slightly lower against COVID-19 mortality in the Omicron dominant period than the period before the Omicron variant became dominant. Vaccine effectiveness against both COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality was higher in general for mRNA vaccines than non mRNA vaccines, however this could be influenced by the different populations given each vaccine vector. Non-zero VE against non-COVID-19 mortality indicates that residual confounding may impact the results, despite the inclusion of up-to-date socio-demographic adjustments and various sources of health data, with possible frailty bias, confounding by indication and a healthy vaccinee effect observed.

ConclusionsThe vaccine effectiveness estimates show increased protection with number of doses and a high level of protection against both COVID-19 hospitalisation and mortality for the third/booster dose, as would be expected from previous research. However, despite the various sources of health data used to adjust the models, the estimates for different breakdowns and for non-COVID-19 mortality expose residual confounding by health status, which should be considered when interpreting estimates of vaccine effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">History of incarceration is associated with an excess of morbidity and mortality. While the incarceration experience itself comes with substantive health risks (e.g., injury, psychological stress, exposure to infectious disease), most inmates eventually return to the general population where they will be diagnosed with the same age-related conditions that drive mortality in the non-incarcerated population but at exaggerated rates. However, the interplay between history of incarceration as a risk factor and more traditional risk factors for age-related diseases (e.g., genetic risk factors) has not been studied. Here, we focus on cognitive impairment, a hallmark of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers disease, as an age-related state that may be uniquely impacted by the confluence of environmental stressors (e.g., incarceration) and genetic risk factors. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, we found that incarceration and APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype (i.e., the chief genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease) both constituted substantive risk factors for cognitive impairment in terms of overall risk and earlier onset. The observed effects were mutually independent, however, suggesting that the risk conveyed by incarceration and APOE-{varepsilon}4 genotype operate across different risk pathways. Our results have implications for the study of criminal justice contact as a public health risk factor for age-related, neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a critical tool for public health surveillance, building on decades of environmental surveillance work for pathogens such as poliovirus. Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.</p>

It is unclear how patient characteristics may be associated with clinically coded long COVID.

We estimated age-sex adjusted hazard ratios and fully adjusted hazard ratios for coded long COVID. Patient characteristics included demographic factors, and health behavioural and clinical factors. Among 17,986,419 adults, 36,886 (0.21%) were clinically coded with long COVID. Patient characteristics associated with coded long COVID included female sex, younger age (under 60 years), obesity, living in less deprived areas, ever smoking, greater consultation frequency, and history of diagnosed asthma, mental health conditions, pre-pandemic post-viral fatigue, or psoriasis. The strength of these associations was attenuated following two-dose vaccination compared to before vaccination. The incidence of coded long COVID was higher after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. These results should be interpreted with caution given that long COVID was likely under-recorded in electronic health records.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter.

MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults.

FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (&gt;70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [&amp;ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks.

InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; AimsThe landscape of nutrition research has changed over the past decades. We aimed to map the landscape of nutrition or diet-related interventions research, using data from randomised controlled trial (RCT) protocols published in the last decade.

MethodsThis meta-research study examined nutrition or diet-related RCT protocols published in journals indexed in PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, PsycINFO, or the Global Health Database between January/2012 and March/2022. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts to check eligibility and one reviewer extracted bibliometric information, study characteristics, and research transparency practices such as protocol registration, conflicts of interest and funding disclosure. We also screened the &#34;Instructions for Authors&#34; of journals with publications in our sample to check for endorsement of SPIRIT, TIDieR, and CONSORT reporting guidelines, and we checked if the authors mentioned these reporting guidelines in their paper.

ResultsThe search retrieved 62,319 records, of which 1,068 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The number of published RCT protocols increased annually between 2012 and 2022, with a mean of 161 (range: 155-163) publications/ year. The USA (n = 165; 15.5%) and Australia (n = 137; 12.8%) published the largest number of protocols. Protocols were published in 148 journals, mainly medical journals (n = 518; 48.5%). Among these journals, 50 (33.8%) endorsed SPIRIT, 111 (75.3%) endorsed CONSORT, and four (2.7%) endorsed TIDieR. In 343 (32.1%) publications the authors mentioned SPIRIT, in 297 (27.8%) CONSORT was mentioned, while 20 (1.9%) mentioned TIDieR. Most protocols reported the RCT registration number (n = 1,006; 94.2%) and included statements about conflicts of interest (n = 952; 89.1%) and funding (n = 994; 93.2%). More than one third of protocols focused on adults and elderly participants (n = 350; 32.7%) and most protocols included participants with a specific clinical condition (n = 726; 68.0%). A single nutrition or diet-related intervention (n = 724; 67.8%) was described in most protocols, with &#34;supplementation, supplements or fortification&#34; (n = 405; 37.9%) and &#34;nutrition education, counseling or coordination of care&#34; (n = 354; 33.1%) being the most frequent types of interventions studied. The most frequent primary outcomes reported were related to clinical status (n = 308; 28.8%), nutritional status (n = 247; 23.1%), and frequency or severity of disease (n = 238; 22.3%). The majority of protocols described a single-centre study (n = 838; 78.5%), with two-arms (n = 844; 79.1%), parallel (n = 1014; 94.9%) design, with a superiority framework (n = 755; 70.7%).

ConclusionsThe number of protocols on nutrition or diet-related trials being published is increasing, indicating the importance of this type of publication. The mention of relevant reporting guidelines by both researchers and journals remains far from ideal. Most protocols assessed supplementation or fortification and nutrition education, counselling or coordination of care interventions, among adults and the elderly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: During the winter of 2022-2023, high rates of all-cause mortality, not seen since April 2020, were recorded in France, with excess all-cause mortality being related to the Omicron and influenza epidemics during that period. Moreover, that period saw a significant increase in the proportion of residents in long-term care facilities among cases of death in the population. Studies have found that increased influenza vaccination coverage in healthcare workers can result in a substantial reduction (up to 20%-30% during the course of select influenza seasons in the pre-pandemic period) in all-cause mortality in residents in nursing homes. Methods: We applied the previously developed methodology to estimate the contribution of influenza infections to all-cause mortality in France for the 2014-2015 through the 2018-2019 influenza seasons, and the contribution of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections to all-cause mortality between week 33, 2022 through week 12, 2023. Results: For the 2014-2015 through the 2018-2019 seasons, influenza was associated with an average of 15654 (95% CI (13013,18340)) deaths, while between week 33, 2022 through week 12, 2023, we estimated 7851 (5213,10463) influenza-associated deaths and 32607 (20794,44496) SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths. The number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths during the Omicron epidemic was significantly higher than the number of deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate or the hospitalization record; for example, between weeks 33-52 in 2022, we estimated 23983 (15307,32620) SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in France, compared with 12811 deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, and 8639 in-hospital deaths with COVID-19 during the same period. Examination of US mortality data suggests a significant contribution of Omicron infections to mortality for cardiac disease and mental/behavioral disorders with COVID-19 not listed on the death certificate. Conclusions: Our results suggest the need for boosting influenza vaccination coverage in different population groups (including healthcare workers, particularly nurse assistants for whom influenza vaccination coverage rates in France are low), as well as for wider use of influenza antiviral medications in influenza-related respiratory hospitalizations with different diagnoses (including pneumonia). Wider detection and treatment of Omicron infections, particularly in older individuals/persons with underlying health conditions such as cardiac disease and mental/behavioral disorders, and wider use of bivalent COVID-19 boosters would be needed in the event of the recrudescence of Omicron circulation in France.</p>
