In this work, we aimed to explore challenges related to self-report errors for biobank-scale research. We derived a reporting error score (RESUM) for n=73,129 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants, capturing inconsistent self-reporting in time-invariant phenotypes across multiple measurement occasions. We then performed genome-wide association scans on RESUM, applied downstream analyses (LD Score Regression and Mendelian Randomization, MR), and compared its properties to a previously studied participation behaviour (UKBB participation propensity). The results were then used in extended analyses (simulations, inverse probability and variance weighting) to explore patterns and propose possible corrections for biases induced by reporting error and/or selective participation. Finally, to assess the impact of reporting error on SNP effects and trait heritability, we improved phenotype resolution for 15 self-report measures and inspected the changes in genomic findings. Reporting error was present in the UKBB across all 33 assessed, time-invariant, measures, with repeatability levels as low as 11% (e.g., inconsistent recall of childhood sunburns). We found that reporting error was not independent from UKBB participation, evidenced by their negative genetic correlation (rg = -0.90), their shared causes (e.g., education, income, intelligence; assessed in MR) and the loss in self-report accuracy following participation bias correction. Depending on where reporting error occurred in the analytical pipeline, its impact ranged from reduced power (e.g., for gene-discovery) to biased effect estimates (e.g., if present in the exposure variable) and attenuation of genome-wide quantities (e.g., 20% relative h2-attenuation for self-reported childhood height). Our findings highlight that both self-report accuracy and selective participation are competing biases and sources of poor reproducibility for biobank-scale research. Implementation of approaches that aim to enhance phenotype resolution while ensuring sample representativeness are therefore essential when working with biobank data.\nSocio-demographic and genetic risk factors for drug adherence and persistence: a retrospective nation-wide and biobank study across 5 medication classes and 1 814 521 individuals\nAuthors: Cordioli, M.; Corbetta, A.; Kariis, H. M.; Jukarainen, S.; Vartiainen, P.; Kiiskinen, T.; Ferro, M.; FinnGen, ; Estonian Biobank research team, ; Lehto, K.; Niemi, M.; Ripatti, S.; Milani, L.; Ganna, A.\nScore: 18.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296740\nLow drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data). Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.\nCovid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, a nested case-control study in births from April 2021 to March 2022, England\nAuthors: Mensah, A. A.; Stowe, J.; Jardine, J. E.; Kirsebom, F. C.; Clare, T.; Kall, M.; Campbell, H.; Lopez-Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.\nScore: 16.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296737\nIntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception. Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes. What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants. What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer. How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.\nModelling the impact of population mobility, post-infection immunity and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Dominican Republic\nAuthors: Finch, E.; Nilles, E. J.; Then Paulino, C.; Skewes-Ramm, R.; Lau, C.; Lowe, R.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296586\nCOVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations. We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios. We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.\nMathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 variant substitutions in European countries: Transmission dynamics and epidemiological insights\nAuthors: Lopez de Rioja, V.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296888\nBackground: Countries across Europe have faced similar evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Materials and Methods: We used data from GISAID and applied a robust, automated mathematical substitution model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 variants across Europe over a period of more than two years, from late 2020 to early 2023. This model identifies variant substitution patterns and distinguishes between residual and dominant behavior. We used weekly sequencing data from 19 European countries to estimate the increase in transmissibility ({triangleup}{beta}) between consecutive SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, we focused on large countries with separate regional outbreaks and complex scenarios of multiple competing variants. Results: Our model accurately reproduced the observed substitution patterns between the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron major variants. We estimated the daily variant prevalence and calculated {triangleup}{beta} between variants, revealing that: (i) {triangleup}{beta} increased progressively from the Alpha to the Omicron variant; (ii) {triangleup}{beta} showed a high degree of variability within Omicron variants; (iii) a higher {triangleup}{beta} was associated with a later emergence of the variant within a country; (iv) a higher degree of immunization of the population against previous variants was associated with a higher {triangleup}{beta} for the Delta variant; (v) larger countries exhibited smaller {triangleup}{beta}, suggesting regionally diverse outbreaks within the same country; and finally (vi) the model reliably captures the dynamics of competing variants, even in complex scenarios. Conclusions: The use of mathematical models allows for the precise and reliable estimation of daily cases of each variant. By quantifying {triangleup}{beta}, we have tracked the spread of the different variants across Europe, highlighting a robust increase in transmissibility trend from Alpha to Omicron. On the other hand, we have shown that the country-level increases in transmissibility can always be influenced by the geographical characteristics of the country and the timing of the emergence of the variant.\nStatus of Soil-Transmitted Helminthiasis Among Adolescents in Anaocha Local Government Area, Anambra State, Nigeria: Prevalence, Associated Factors, and Future Directions After a Decade of Ongoing Mass Administration of Medicines\nAuthors: Aribodor, O. B.; Jacob, E. C.; Azugo, N. O.; Ngenegbo, U. C.; Obika, I. E.; Obikwelu, E. M.; Nebe, O. J.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.23295620\nOver the past decade, Anambra State, Nigeria, has implemented mass administration of medicines (MAMs) to combat soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), a significant public health challenge in low-income regions. Nevertheless, these efforts have predominantly focused on pre-school and school-aged children, leaving a notable gap in understanding STH infection rates and the efficacy of these campaigns among secondary school adolescents, who have been excluded from this initiative. Our study aimed to address this critical knowledge gap by assessing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence and contextual factors hindering effective control among adolescents in Anambra State, Nigeria. We actively engaged 443 adolescents with a mean age of 14 years in a school-based cross-sectional study in selected communities within the Anaocha Local Government Area from 8 February to 7 July 2023 following informed consent and assent procedures. Employing a stratified random sampling technique, we collected demographic data and assessed STH risk factors using a structured questionnaire hosted on the Kobo Toolbox platform. For quantitative analysis of STH infections, the Kato-Katz technique was used. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, incorporating descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression, with statistical significance set at p\u003c0.05. Of the 443 (213 males (48.0%) and 230 females (52.0%) adolescents studied, the overall prevalence of STH observed was 35.2% (156/443). Ascaris lumbricoides was the prevalent STH species (16.9%), followed by Trichuris trichiura (1.4%) and hookworm (0.5%). Only light-intensity infection was observed. Mixed infections were observed in 16.5% of adolescents, involving A. lumbricoides and hookworm (10.8%), followed by A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura (3.2%) and all three STH (2.5%). The observed overall prevalence was not statistically significant with respect to gender (OR: 0.961; 95% CI: 0.651-1.420; p \u003e 0.05) or age (OR: 0.686; 95% CI: 0.459-1.025; p\u003e0.05). Class (grade level) (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.45, p = 0.003), knowledge and transmission of STH infection (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.86, p = 0.008), parental occupation (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.35 - 2.67, p \u003c 0.001), parents literacy level (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48 - 0.96, p = 0.027), and the type of toilet (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.54 - 3.00, p \u003c 0.001) were all significantly correlated with STH infection. These findings highlight the role of adolescents in sustaining soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) transmission. Coupled with school-based deworming expansion, innovative improvements in water, sanitation, hygiene, and awareness can provide a cost-effective, sustainable solution for combatting STH infections in Anambra State.\nUnravelling Causal Associations between Population Mobility and COVID-19 Cases in Spain: a Transfer Entropy Analysis\nAuthors: Ponce de Leon, M.; Pontes, C.; Arenas, A.; Valencia, A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296732\nHuman mobility is a well-known factor in the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to healthcare systems collapsing in numerous countries, such as Spain and Italy, resulting in a significant number of deaths. To avoid such disastrous outcomes in the future, it is vital to understand how population mobility is linked to the spread of infectious diseases. To assess that, we applied an information theoretic approach called transfer entropy (TE) to measure the influence of the number of infected people travelling between two localities on the future number of infected people in the destination. We first validated our approach using simulated data from a SIR epidemiological model and found that the mobility-based TE was effective in filtering out non-causal influences that could otherwise arise, thereby successfully recovering the epidemics spreading patterns and the mobility network topology. We then applied the mobility-based TE to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. We identified which regions acted as the main drivers of the pandemic at different periods, both globally and locally. Our results unravelled significant epidemiological events such as the outbreak in Lleida during the Summer of 2020, caused by the influx of temporary workers. We also analysed the effects of a non-pharmaceutical intervention in Catalunya, using mobility- based TE to compare the infection dynamics with a control region. These results help clarify how human mobility influences the dynamic spread of infectious diseases and could be used to inform future non-pharmaceutical interventions.\nUnited States Marijuana Legalization and Opioid Mortality Trends Before and During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Bleyer, A.; Barnes, B.; Finn, K.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296502\nTo determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.\nChikungunya intra-vector dynamics in Aedes albopictus from Lyon (France) upon exposure to a human viremia-like dose range reveals vector barrier permissiveness and supports local epidemic potential\nAuthors: Viginier, B.; Cappuccio, L.; Garnier, C.; Martin, E.; Maisse, C.; Valiente Moro, C.; Minard, G.; Fontaine, A.; Lequime, S.; Ratinier, M.; Arnaud, F.; Raquin, V.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.06.22281997\nArbovirus emergence and epidemic potential, as approximated by the vectorial capacity formula, depends on host and vector parameters, including the vectors intrinsic ability to replicate then transmit the pathogen known as vector competence. Vector competence is a complex, time dependent, quantitative phenotype influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. A combination of experimental and modelling approaches is required to assess arbovirus intra-vector dynamics and estimate epidemic potential. In this study, we measured infection, dissemination, and transmission dynamics of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a field-derived Aedes albopictus population (Lyon, France) after oral exposure to a range of virus doses spanning human viraemia. Statistical modelling indicates rapid and efficient CHIKV progression in the vector mainly due to an absence of a dissemination barrier, with 100% of the infected mosquitoes ultimately exhibiting a disseminated infection, regardless of the virus dose. Transmission rate data revealed a time-dependent, but overall weak, transmission barrier, with individuals transmitting as soon as 2 days post-exposure (dpe) and =50% infectious mosquitoes at 6 dpe for the highest dose. Based on these experimental intra-vector dynamics data, epidemiological simulations conducted with an agent-based model showed that even at low mosquito biting rates, CHIKV could trigger outbreaks locally. Together, this reveals the epidemic potential of CHIKV upon transmission by Aedes albopictus in mainland France.\nSimulation of COVID-19 Epidemic from Potential Viral Loads in Saudi Arabian Wastewater Treatment Plants\nAuthors: Meetei, M. Z.; Msmali, A. H.; Ahmadini, A. A. H.; Alshqaq, S. S. A.; Alnashiri, H. M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.23296175\nSARS-CoV-2 is a contagious respiratory virus that has been discovered in sewage, human waste, and wastewater treatment facilities. Wastewater surveillance has been considered one of the lowest-cost means of testing for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in communities. This paper highlights the dynamics of the viruss infection, persistence, and occurrence in wastewater treatment plants. Our aim is to develop and implement a mathematical model to infer the epidemic dynamics from the possible density of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater. We present a log-normal model and fractional order of susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) epidemic model for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 disease from the wastewater data. We study the dynamic properties of the fractional order SEIR model with respect to the fractional ordered values. The model is used to comprehend how the coronavirus spreads through wastewater treatment plants in Saudi Arabia. Our modeling approach can help with wastewater surveillance for early prediction and cost-effective monitoring of the epidemic outbreak in a situation of low testing capacity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">While the use of short self-report measures is common practice in biobank initiatives, such phenotyping strategy is inherently prone to reporting errors. In this work, we aimed to explore challenges related to self-report errors for biobank-scale research.

We derived a reporting error score (RESUM) for n=73,129 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants, capturing inconsistent self-reporting in time-invariant phenotypes across multiple measurement occasions. We then performed genome-wide association scans on RESUM, applied downstream analyses (LD Score Regression and Mendelian Randomization, MR), and compared its properties to a previously studied participation behaviour (UKBB participation propensity). The results were then used in extended analyses (simulations, inverse probability and variance weighting) to explore patterns and propose possible corrections for biases induced by reporting error and/or selective participation. Finally, to assess the impact of reporting error on SNP effects and trait heritability, we improved phenotype resolution for 15 self-report measures and inspected the changes in genomic findings.

Reporting error was present in the UKBB across all 33 assessed, time-invariant, measures, with repeatability levels as low as 11% (e.g., inconsistent recall of childhood sunburns). We found that reporting error was not independent from UKBB participation, evidenced by their negative genetic correlation (rg = -0.90), their shared causes (e.g., education, income, intelligence; assessed in MR) and the loss in self-report accuracy following participation bias correction. Depending on where reporting error occurred in the analytical pipeline, its impact ranged from reduced power (e.g., for gene-discovery) to biased effect estimates (e.g., if present in the exposure variable) and attenuation of genome-wide quantities (e.g., 20% relative h2-attenuation for self-reported childhood height).

Our findings highlight that both self-report accuracy and selective participation are competing biases and sources of poor reproducibility for biobank-scale research. Implementation of approaches that aim to enhance phenotype resolution while ensuring sample representativeness are therefore essential when working with biobank data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data).

Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy.

MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception.

Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95).

ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.

What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants.

What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations.

We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios.

We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to  buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Countries across Europe have faced similar evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Materials and Methods: We used data from GISAID and applied a robust, automated mathematical substitution model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 variants across Europe over a period of more than two years, from late 2020 to early 2023. This model identifies variant substitution patterns and distinguishes between residual and dominant behavior. We used weekly sequencing data from 19 European countries to estimate the increase in transmissibility ({triangleup}{beta}) between consecutive SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, we focused on large countries with separate regional outbreaks and complex scenarios of multiple competing variants. Results: Our model accurately reproduced the observed substitution patterns between the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron major variants. We estimated the daily variant prevalence and calculated {triangleup}{beta} between variants, revealing that: (i) {triangleup}{beta} increased progressively from the Alpha to the Omicron variant; (ii) {triangleup}{beta} showed a high degree of variability within Omicron variants; (iii) a higher {triangleup}{beta} was associated with a later emergence of the variant within a country; (iv) a higher degree of immunization of the population against previous variants was associated with a higher {triangleup}{beta} for the Delta variant; (v) larger countries exhibited smaller {triangleup}{beta}, suggesting regionally diverse outbreaks within the same country; and finally (vi) the model reliably captures the dynamics of competing variants, even in complex scenarios. Conclusions: The use of mathematical models allows for the precise and reliable estimation of daily cases of each variant. By quantifying {triangleup}{beta}, we have tracked the spread of the different variants across Europe, highlighting a robust increase in transmissibility trend from Alpha to Omicron. On the other hand, we have shown that the country-level increases in transmissibility can always be influenced by the geographical characteristics of the country and the timing of the emergence of the variant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the past decade, Anambra State, Nigeria, has implemented mass administration of medicines (MAMs) to combat soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), a significant public health challenge in low-income regions. Nevertheless, these efforts have predominantly focused on pre-school and school-aged children, leaving a notable gap in understanding STH infection rates and the efficacy of these campaigns among secondary school adolescents, who have been excluded from this initiative. Our study aimed to address this critical knowledge gap by assessing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence and contextual factors hindering effective control among adolescents in Anambra State, Nigeria. We actively engaged 443 adolescents with a mean age of 14 years in a school-based cross-sectional study in selected communities within the Anaocha Local Government Area from 8 February to 7 July 2023 following informed consent and assent procedures. Employing a stratified random sampling technique, we collected demographic data and assessed STH risk factors using a structured questionnaire hosted on the Kobo Toolbox platform. For quantitative analysis of STH infections, the Kato-Katz technique was used. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 25, incorporating descriptive statistics and multinomial logistic regression, with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05. Of the 443 (213 males (48.0%) and 230 females (52.0%) adolescents studied, the overall prevalence of STH observed was 35.2% (156/443). Ascaris lumbricoides was the prevalent STH species (16.9%), followed by Trichuris trichiura (1.4%) and hookworm (0.5%). Only light-intensity infection was observed. Mixed infections were observed in 16.5% of adolescents, involving A. lumbricoides and hookworm (10.8%), followed by A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura (3.2%) and all three STH (2.5%). The observed overall prevalence was not statistically significant with respect to gender (OR: 0.961; 95% CI: 0.651-1.420; p &gt; 0.05) or age (OR: 0.686; 95% CI: 0.459-1.025; p&gt;0.05). Class (grade level) (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25 - 2.45, p = 0.003), knowledge and transmission of STH infection (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.86, p = 0.008), parental occupation (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.35 - 2.67, p &lt; 0.001), parents literacy level (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48 - 0.96, p = 0.027), and the type of toilet (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.54 - 3.00, p &lt; 0.001) were all significantly correlated with STH infection. These findings highlight the role of adolescents in sustaining soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) transmission. Coupled with school-based deworming expansion, innovative improvements in water, sanitation, hygiene, and awareness can provide a cost-effective, sustainable solution for combatting STH infections in Anambra State.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human mobility is a well-known factor in the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to healthcare systems collapsing in numerous countries, such as Spain and Italy, resulting in a significant number of deaths. To avoid such disastrous outcomes in the future, it is vital to understand how population mobility is linked to the spread of infectious diseases. To assess that, we applied an information theoretic approach called transfer entropy (TE) to measure the influence of the number of infected people travelling between two localities on the future number of infected people in the destination. We first validated our approach using simulated data from a SIR epidemiological model and found that the mobility-based TE was effective in filtering out non-causal influences that could otherwise arise, thereby successfully recovering the epidemics spreading patterns and the mobility network topology. We then applied the mobility-based TE to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. We identified which regions acted as the main drivers of the pandemic at different periods, both globally and locally. Our results unravelled significant epidemiological events such as the outbreak in Lleida during the Summer of 2020, caused by the influx of temporary workers. We also analysed the effects of a non-pharmaceutical intervention in Catalunya, using mobility- based TE to compare the infection dynamics with a control region. These results help clarify how human mobility influences the dynamic spread of infectious diseases and could be used to inform future non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arbovirus emergence and epidemic potential, as approximated by the vectorial capacity formula, depends on host and vector parameters, including the vectors intrinsic ability to replicate then transmit the pathogen known as vector competence. Vector competence is a complex, time dependent, quantitative phenotype influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. A combination of experimental and modelling approaches is required to assess arbovirus intra-vector dynamics and estimate epidemic potential. In this study, we measured infection, dissemination, and transmission dynamics of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a field-derived Aedes albopictus population (Lyon, France) after oral exposure to a range of virus doses spanning human viraemia. Statistical modelling indicates rapid and efficient CHIKV progression in the vector mainly due to an absence of a dissemination barrier, with 100% of the infected mosquitoes ultimately exhibiting a disseminated infection, regardless of the virus dose. Transmission rate data revealed a time-dependent, but overall weak, transmission barrier, with individuals transmitting as soon as 2 days post-exposure (dpe) and =50% infectious mosquitoes at 6 dpe for the highest dose. Based on these experimental intra-vector dynamics data, epidemiological simulations conducted with an agent-based model showed that even at low mosquito biting rates, CHIKV could trigger outbreaks locally. Together, this reveals the epidemic potential of CHIKV upon transmission by Aedes albopictus in mainland France.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 is a contagious respiratory virus that has been discovered in sewage, human waste, and wastewater treatment facilities. Wastewater surveillance has been considered one of the lowest-cost means of testing for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in communities. This paper highlights the dynamics of the viruss infection, persistence, and occurrence in wastewater treatment plants. Our aim is to develop and implement a mathematical model to infer the epidemic dynamics from the possible density of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater. We present a log-normal model and fractional order of susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) epidemic model for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 disease from the wastewater data. We study the dynamic properties of the fractional order SEIR model with respect to the fractional ordered values. The model is used to comprehend how the coronavirus spreads through wastewater treatment plants in Saudi Arabia. Our modeling approach can help with wastewater surveillance for early prediction and cost-effective monitoring of the epidemic outbreak in a situation of low testing capacity.</p>
