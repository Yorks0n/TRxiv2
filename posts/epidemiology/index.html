H.\nScore: 297.6, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294204\nBackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors. MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex. ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [\u0026le;]60 years, [\u0026ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone. ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022. SettingCommunity Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received \u003e= 3 vaccine doses. Main outcome measuresPrevalence of Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression. Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p \u003c 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study. Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns \u003e=2 months after the acute illness. Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%). The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with \u003e=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare. The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.\nInfluence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection on COVID-19 Severity: Evidence from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative\nAuthors: Hendrix, N.; Sidky, H.; Sahner, D.; N3C Consortium, Score: 764.1, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293612\nBackgroundAs SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned from a pandemic to endemic disease, the majority of new infections have been among previously infected individuals. To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections. MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups. ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic. ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes? FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections. MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.\nPost-COVID rebound of gonorrhoea in England\nAuthors: Fountain, H.; Migchelsen, S.; Charles, H.; Ram, T.; Fifer, H.; Mohammed, H.; Sinka, K.\nScore: 32.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294107\nWith the removal of all COVID-19 restrictions in July 2021, a marked increase in gonorrhoea diagnoses in England was observed. Investigations revealed increases have been widespread, particularly in young people aged 15-to-24 years. Testing numbers have not shown a corresponding increase and have remained below 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels.

I.; Gonzales, M. M.; Aparicio, H. J.; Salinas, J.; Yuan, C.; Jacques, P. F.; Beiser, A.; Seshadri, S.; Jacob, M. E.; Himali, J. J.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294374\nBackgroundThe Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), has been specifically designed to capture the inflammatory content of diet and has shown association with neurodegenerative disease related outcomes. But literature is limited on the role of diet-driven inflammation measured by the DII on incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimers disease dementia (AD). ObjectiveWe evaluated whether higher DII scores were associated with increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD over 22.3 years of follow-up in the community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsObservational longitudinal study in the FHS Offspring cohort. Dementia surveillance for present study: until 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to June 2022. Participants completed a validated 126-item food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), administered at FHS examination cycle 7 (1998-2001) and examination cycle 5 (1991-1995), and/or 6 (1995-1998). Individuals aged \u003c60 years, with prevalent dementia, no dementia follow-up, other relevant neurological diseases, and/or no FFQ data were excluded. ExposureA DII score (based on the published method by Shivappa et al. 2014) was created based on previous studies linking individual dietary factors to six inflammatory markers (i.e. C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1{beta}, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), consisting of 36 components. A cumulative DII score was calculated by averaging across a maximum of three FFQs. Main outcomes and measuresIncident all-cause dementia and AD. ResultsWe included 1487 participants (mean{+/-}SD, age in years 69 {+/-} 6; 53{middle dot}2% women; 31{middle dot}6% college graduates]). 246 participants developed all-cause dementia (including AD n=187) over a median follow up time of 13{middle dot}1 years. Higher DII scores were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD following adjustment for age and sex (Hazard ratio (HR) 1{middle dot}16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1{middle dot}07 to 1{middle dot}25, p\u003c.001; HR 1{middle dot}16, 95% CI 1{middle dot}06 to 1{middle dot}26, p=.001). The relationships remained after additional adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates (HR 1{middle dot}21, 95% CI 1{middle dot}10 to 1{middle dot}33, p\u003c0.001; HR1{middle dot}20, 95% CI1{middle dot}07 to 1{middle dot}35, p=.001). Conclusion and relevanceHigher DII scores were associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Although these promising findings need to be replicated and further validated, our results suggest that diets which correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia.\nEmployment outcomes of people with Long Covid symptoms: community-based cohort study\nAuthors: Ayoubkhani, D.; Zaccardi, F.; Pouwels, K. B.; Walker, A. S.; Houston, D.; Alwan, N. A.; Martin, J.; Khunti, K.; Nafilyan, V.\nScore: 78.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.21.23287524\nBackgroundEvidence on the long-term employment consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking. We used data from a large, community-based sample in the UK to estimate associations between Long Covid and subsequent employment outcomes. MethodsThis was an observational, longitudinal study using a pre-post design. We included survey participants from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2022 when they were aged 16 to 64 years and not in full-time education. Using conditional logit modelling, we explored the time-varying relationship between Long Covid status [\u0026ge;]12 weeks after a first test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (reference: pre-infection) and labour market inactivity (neither working nor looking for work) or workplace absence lasting [\u0026ge;]4 weeks. ResultsOf 206,299 included participants (mean age 45 years, 54% female, 92% white), 15% were ever inactive in the labour market and 10% were ever long-term absent during follow-up. Compared with pre-infection, inactivity was higher in participants reporting Long Covid 30 to \u003c40 weeks (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.45; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.81) or 40 to \u003c52 weeks (1.34; 1.05 to 1.72) post-infection. Combining with official statistics on Long Covid prevalence, our estimates translate to 27,000 (95% CI: 6,000 to 47,000) working-age adults in the UK being inactive because of Long Covid in July 2022. ConclusionsLong Covid is likely to have contributed to reduced levels of participation in the UK labour market, though it is unlikely to be the sole driver. Further research is required to quantify the contribution of other factors, such as indirect health effects of the pandemic.\nImproving estimates of epidemiological quantities by combining reported cases with wastewater data: a statistical framework with applications to COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand\nAuthors: Watson, L. M.; Plank, M. J.; Armstrong, B.; Chapman, J.; Hewitt, J.; Morris, H.; Orsi, A.; Bunce, M.; Donnelly, C. A.; Steyn, N.\nScore: 71.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294060\nBackgroundTimely and informed public health responses to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 necessitate reliable information about infection dynamics. The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by human behaviours. Here, we investigated how these two data sources can be combined to inform estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number, R, and track changes in the CAR over time. MethodsWe constructed a state-space model that we solved using sequential Monte Carlo methods. The observed data are the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence. The hidden states that we estimate are R and CAR. Model parameters are estimated using the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings algorithm. FindingsWe analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. Accounting for reduced CAR, we estimate that New Zealands second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022. The CAR in subsequent waves around November 2022 and April 2023 was estimated to be comparable to that in the second Omicron wave. InterpretationThis work on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to give insight into key epidemiological quantities. Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time, which may be increasingly useful as intensive pandemic surveillance programmes are wound down. FundingNew Zealand Ministry of Health, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Royal Society Te Ap[a]rangi, Imperial College London, and University of Oxford. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been a substantial increase in the number of publications focusing on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed for \"wastewater based epidemiology\" and found fewer than 10 papers per year prior to 2014 with a drastic increase to 463 in 2022. Approximately 52% of the WBE publications are related to COVID-19 (\"wastewater based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\")). Many studies have focused on detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems but only 10 have estimated the reproduction number (\"wastewater based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND \"reproduction number\"). No previous work has combined WBE with reported case data to estimate (relative) case ascertainment rate (\"waste-water based epidemiology\" AND (\"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\") AND \"case ascertainment rate\"). Previous work has estimated the reproduction number from reported cases assuming constant under-ascertainment but the issue of time-varying case ascertainment has not yet been addressed, except to demonstrate the effect of a pre-determined change in case ascertainment. Added value of this studyWe present a model that, for the first time, enables reported case information to be combined with wastewater data to estimate epidemiology quantities. This work further demonstrates the utility of WBE; the reproduction number can be estimated in the absence of reported case information (although results are more reliable when case data are included), and wastewater data include information that, when combined with case data, can be used to estimate the time-varying relative case ascertainment rate. Implications of all the available evidenceIn order to make informed and timely public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. WBE provides a useful source of data that is not impacted by time-varying testing practices. Wastewater data can be quantitatively combined with case information to better understand the state of an epidemic. In order to determine the absolute case ascertainment rate (rather than the relative rate calculated in this work), there is a need for infection prevalence surveys to calibrate model results against.\nFirst-Time Prescribing of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists from 2018-2023: A Descriptive Analysis\nAuthors: Rodriguez, P. J.; Gratzl, S.; Goodwin Cartwright, B. M.; Brar, R.; Gluckman, T. J.; Stucky, N.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294277\nAimsLimited recent data exist on prescribing patterns and patient characteristics for glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), an important drug class for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and/or overweight or obesity. We describe trends in first-time prescribing of GLP-1 RAs. Materials and MethodsUsing aggregated US electronic health record data, we identified first-time prescriptions of GLP-1 RAs between January 2018 and June 2023 for adults receiving regular care. We describe prescribing volumes stratified by patient characteristics, specific drug, and FDA-labelled indication. The 5.5-year analysis period was divided into six-month periods. ResultsIn total, 274,562 patients were newly prescribed a GLP-1 RA, with a significant increase over time (January to June, 2018: 9,642 versus 2023: 66,569; p \u003c 0.001). Overall, 181,860 (66.2%) patients had T2D and 229,715 (83.7%) had obesity or overweight. The proportion with T2D decreased over time (January through June, 2018: 84.1% versus 2023: 49%; p \u003c 0.001), while the proportion with overweight or obesity increased (January through June, 2018: 75.9% versus 2023: 90.7%; p \u003c.001). Of prescriptions with a known FDA-labelled indication (74.2%), 87% were labelled for T2D and 13% were labelled for overweight or obesity. Patients first prescribed a GLP-1 RA labelled for T2D were 59.1% female with a mean (SD) age of 58.6 (13) years, while those prescribed a GLP-1 RA labelled for overweight or obesity were 82.9% female, with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (12.2) years. ConclusionsWe observed an increase in first-time prescribing of GLP-1 RAs overall, and a shift away from a predominately T2D population.\nGenetic Insights into the Microevolutionary Dynamics and Early Introductions of Human Monkeypox Virus in Mexico\nAuthors: Gomez-Sanchez, I.; Castelan-Sanchez, H. G.; Martinez-Castilla, L. P.; Hurtado-Ramirez, J. M.; Lopez-Leal, G.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294674\nThe recent global outbreak of Monkeypox, caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPVX) emerged in Europe in 2022 and rapidly spread to over 40 countries. The Americas are currently facing the highest impact, reporting over 50,000 cases by early 2023. Here, we analyze 880 MPXV isolates worldwide to gain insights into the evolutionary patterns and initial introduction events of the virus in Mexico. We found that MPXV entered Mexico on multiple occasions, from the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Canada, and subsequently spread locally in different regions of Mexico. Additionally, we show that MPXV has an open pangenome, highlighting the role of gene turnover in shaping its genomic diversity, rather than SNPs variations, which do not contribute significantly to genome diversity. Although the genome presents multiple SNP sites in coding regions, these remain under purifying selection, suggesting their evolutionary conservation. One notable exception is the amino acid site 63 of the protein encoded by the Cop-A4L gene, intricately related to viral maturity, for which we picked up a strong signal of positive selection. Ancestral state reconstruction deduced that the ancestral state at site 63 corresponds to the amino acid valine, present only in isolates of clade I. However, the isolates of the current outbreak evolved for threonine at site 63. Finally, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the evolutionary processes of the Monkeypox virus.\nNon-linear mendelian randomization: evaluation of biases using negative controls with a focus on BMI and Vitamin D\nAuthors: Hamilton, F. W.; Hughes, D. A.; Spiller, W.; Tilling, K.; Davey Smith, G.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23293658\nMendelian randomisation (MR) is an established technique in epidemiological investigation, using the principle of random allocation of genetic variants at conception to generate predicted causal effects of an exposure on an outcome. Extensions to this technique include non-linear approaches, that allow for differential effects of the exposure on the outcome depending on the level of the exposure. One popular method is the residual approach, which allows for stratification of the exposure via the level of the exposure and generation of causal estimates within each stratum. These \"local\" causal estimates are then used to make inferences about non-linear associations. Recent work has identified that under certain situations this method can lead to estimates that are seriously biased, and a new method - the doubly-ranked method - has been introduced as a possibly more robust approach. In this paper, we perform an analysis using negative control outcomes using both methods and find biased estimates in certain situations. We suggest caution in use of these methods and, if used, the performance of a number of sanity checks such as negative control outcomes in their reporting.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors.

MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex.

ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [&amp;le;]60 years, [&amp;ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone.

ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo characterise Long COVID in a highly vaccinated population infected by Omicron.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022.

SettingCommunity

Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received &gt;= 3 vaccine doses.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence of  Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression.

Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p &lt; 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study.

Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns &gt;=2 months after the acute illness.

Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%).

The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with &gt;=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare.

The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned from a pandemic to endemic disease, the majority of new infections have been among previously infected individuals. To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections.

MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups.

ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic.

ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes?

FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections.

MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), has been specifically designed to capture the inflammatory content of diet and has shown association with neurodegenerative disease related outcomes. But literature is limited on the role of diet-driven inflammation measured by the DII on incident all-cause dementia and Alzheimers disease dementia (AD).

ObjectiveWe evaluated whether higher DII scores were associated with increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD over 22.3 years of follow-up in the community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsObservational longitudinal study in the FHS Offspring cohort. Dementia surveillance for present study: until 2020. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to June 2022. Participants completed a validated 126-item food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), administered at FHS examination cycle 7 (1998-2001) and examination cycle 5 (1991-1995), and/or 6 (1995-1998). Individuals aged &lt;60 years, with prevalent dementia, no dementia follow-up, other relevant neurological diseases, and/or no FFQ data were excluded.

ExposureA DII score (based on the published method by Shivappa et al. 2014) was created based on previous studies linking individual dietary factors to six inflammatory markers (i.e. C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-1{beta}, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), consisting of 36 components. A cumulative DII score was calculated by averaging across a maximum of three FFQs.

Main outcomes and measuresIncident all-cause dementia and AD.

ResultsWe included 1487 participants (mean{&#43;/-}SD, age in years 69 {&#43;/-} 6; 53{middle dot}2% women; 31{middle dot}6% college graduates]). 246 participants developed all-cause dementia (including AD n=187) over a median follow up time of 13{middle dot}1 years. Higher DII scores were associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia and AD following adjustment for age and sex (Hazard ratio (HR) 1{middle dot}16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1{middle dot}07 to 1{middle dot}25, p&lt;.001; HR 1{middle dot}16, 95% CI 1{middle dot}06 to 1{middle dot}26, p=.001). The relationships remained after additional adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates (HR 1{middle dot}21, 95% CI 1{middle dot}10 to 1{middle dot}33, p&lt;0.001; HR1{middle dot}20, 95% CI1{middle dot}07 to 1{middle dot}35, p=.001).

Conclusion and relevanceHigher DII scores were associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia and AD. Although these promising findings need to be replicated and further validated, our results suggest that diets which correlate with low DII scores may prevent late-life dementia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEvidence on the long-term employment consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lacking. We used data from a large, community-based sample in the UK to estimate associations between Long Covid and subsequent employment outcomes.

MethodsThis was an observational, longitudinal study using a pre-post design. We included survey participants from 3 February 2021 to 30 September 2022 when they were aged 16 to 64 years and not in full-time education. Using conditional logit modelling, we explored the time-varying relationship between Long Covid status [&amp;ge;]12 weeks after a first test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (reference: pre-infection) and labour market inactivity (neither working nor looking for work) or workplace absence lasting [&amp;ge;]4 weeks.

ResultsOf 206,299 included participants (mean age 45 years, 54% female, 92% white), 15% were ever inactive in the labour market and 10% were ever long-term absent during follow-up. Compared with pre-infection, inactivity was higher in participants reporting Long Covid 30 to &lt;40 weeks (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.45; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.81) or 40 to &lt;52 weeks (1.34; 1.05 to 1.72) post-infection. Combining with official statistics on Long Covid prevalence, our estimates translate to 27,000 (95% CI: 6,000 to 47,000) working-age adults in the UK being inactive because of Long Covid in July 2022.

ConclusionsLong Covid is likely to have contributed to reduced levels of participation in the UK labour market, though it is unlikely to be the sole driver. Further research is required to quantify the contribution of other factors, such as indirect health effects of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTimely and informed public health responses to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 necessitate reliable information about infection dynamics. The case ascertainment rate (CAR), the proportion of infections that are reported as cases, is typically much less than one and varies with testing practices and behaviours, making reported cases unreliable as the sole source of data. The concentration of viral RNA in wastewater samples provides an alternate measure of infection prevalence that is not affected by human behaviours. Here, we investigated how these two data sources can be combined to inform estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number, R, and track changes in the CAR over time.

MethodsWe constructed a state-space model that we solved using sequential Monte Carlo methods. The observed data are the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and reported case incidence. The hidden states that we estimate are R and CAR. Model parameters are estimated using the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings algorithm.

FindingsWe analysed data from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2023 from Aotearoa New Zealand. Our model estimates that R peaked at 2.76 (95% CrI 2.20, 3.83) around 18 February 2022 and the CAR peaked around 12 March 2022. Accounting for reduced CAR, we estimate that New Zealands second Omicron wave in July 2022 was similar in size to the first, despite fewer reported cases. We estimate that the CAR in the BA.5 Omicron wave in July 2022 was approximately 50% lower than in the BA.1/BA.2 Omicron wave in March 2022. The CAR in subsequent waves around November 2022 and April 2023 was estimated to be comparable to that in the second Omicron wave.

InterpretationThis work on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can be used to give insight into key epidemiological quantities. Estimating R, CAR, and cumulative number of infections provides useful information for planning public health responses and understanding the state of immunity in the population. This model is a useful disease surveillance tool, improving situational awareness of infectious disease dynamics in real-time, which may be increasingly useful as intensive pandemic surveillance programmes are wound down.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere has been a substantial increase in the number of publications focusing on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed for &#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; and found fewer than 10 papers per year prior to 2014 with a drastic increase to 463 in 2022. Approximately 52% of the WBE publications are related to COVID-19 (&#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;)). Many studies have focused on detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems but only 10 have estimated the reproduction number (&#34;wastewater based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;) AND &#34;reproduction number&#34;). No previous work has combined WBE with reported case data to estimate (relative) case ascertainment rate (&#34;waste-water based epidemiology&#34; AND (&#34;SARS-CoV-2&#34; OR &#34;COVID-19&#34;) AND &#34;case ascertainment rate&#34;). Previous work has estimated the reproduction number from reported cases assuming constant under-ascertainment but the issue of time-varying case ascertainment has not yet been addressed, except to demonstrate the effect of a pre-determined change in case ascertainment.

Added value of this studyWe present a model that, for the first time, enables reported case information to be combined with wastewater data to estimate epidemiology quantities. This work further demonstrates the utility of WBE; the reproduction number can be estimated in the absence of reported case information (although results are more reliable when case data are included), and wastewater data include information that, when combined with case data, can be used to estimate the time-varying relative case ascertainment rate.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn order to make informed and timely public health decisions about infectious diseases, it is important to understand the number of infections in the community. WBE provides a useful source of data that is not impacted by time-varying testing practices. Wastewater data can be quantitatively combined with case information to better understand the state of an epidemic. In order to determine the absolute case ascertainment rate (rather than the relative rate calculated in this work), there is a need for infection prevalence surveys to calibrate model results against.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AimsLimited recent data exist on prescribing patterns and patient characteristics for glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), an important drug class for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and/or overweight or obesity. We describe trends in first-time prescribing of GLP-1 RAs.

Materials and MethodsUsing aggregated US electronic health record data, we identified first-time prescriptions of GLP-1 RAs between January 2018 and June 2023 for adults receiving regular care. We describe prescribing volumes stratified by patient characteristics, specific drug, and FDA-labelled indication. The 5.5-year analysis period was divided into six-month periods.

ResultsIn total, 274,562 patients were newly prescribed a GLP-1 RA, with a significant increase over time (January to June, 2018: 9,642 versus 2023: 66,569; p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 181,860 (66.2%) patients had T2D and 229,715 (83.7%) had obesity or overweight. The proportion with T2D decreased over time (January through June, 2018: 84.1% versus 2023: 49%; p &lt; 0.001), while the proportion with overweight or obesity increased (January through June, 2018: 75.9% versus 2023: 90.7%; p &lt;.001). Of prescriptions with a known FDA-labelled indication (74.2%), 87% were labelled for T2D and 13% were labelled for overweight or obesity. Patients first prescribed a GLP-1 RA labelled for T2D were 59.1% female with a mean (SD) age of 58.6 (13) years, while those prescribed a GLP-1 RA labelled for overweight or obesity were 82.9% female, with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (12.2) years.

ConclusionsWe observed an increase in first-time prescribing of GLP-1 RAs overall, and a shift away from a predominately T2D population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recent global outbreak of Monkeypox, caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPVX) emerged in Europe in 2022 and rapidly spread to over 40 countries. The Americas are currently facing the highest impact, reporting over 50,000 cases by early 2023. Here, we analyze 880 MPXV isolates worldwide to gain insights into the evolutionary patterns and initial introduction events of the virus in Mexico. We found that MPXV entered Mexico on multiple occasions, from the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Canada, and subsequently spread locally in different regions of Mexico. Additionally, we show that MPXV has an open pangenome, highlighting the role of gene turnover in shaping its genomic diversity, rather than SNPs variations, which do not contribute significantly to genome diversity. Although the genome presents multiple SNP sites in coding regions, these remain under purifying selection, suggesting their evolutionary conservation. One notable exception is the amino acid site 63 of the protein encoded by the Cop-A4L gene, intricately related to viral maturity, for which we picked up a strong signal of positive selection. Ancestral state reconstruction deduced that the ancestral state at site 63 corresponds to the amino acid valine, present only in isolates of clade I. However, the isolates of the current outbreak evolved for threonine at site 63. Finally, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the evolutionary processes of the Monkeypox virus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an established technique in epidemiological investigation, using the principle of random allocation of genetic variants at conception to generate predicted causal effects of an exposure on an outcome. Extensions to this technique include non-linear approaches, that allow for differential effects of the exposure on the outcome depending on the level of the exposure. One popular method is the residual approach, which allows for stratification of the exposure via the level of the exposure and generation of causal estimates within each stratum. These &#34;local&#34; causal estimates are then used to make inferences about non-linear associations. Recent work has identified that under certain situations this method can lead to estimates that are seriously biased, and a new method - the doubly-ranked method - has been introduced as a possibly more robust approach. In this paper, we perform an analysis using negative control outcomes using both methods and find biased estimates in certain situations. We suggest caution in use of these methods and, if used, the performance of a number of sanity checks such as negative control outcomes in their reporting.</p>
