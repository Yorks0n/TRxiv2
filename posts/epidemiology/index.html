DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022. SettingCommunity Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received \u003e= 3 vaccine doses. Main outcome measuresPrevalence of Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression. Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p \u003c 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study. Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns \u003e=2 months after the acute illness. Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%). The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with \u003e=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare. The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.\nDiabetes following SARS-CoV-2 infection: Incidence, persistence, and implications of COVID-19 vaccination. A cohort study of fifteen million people.\nAuthors: Taylor, K.; Eastwood, S.; Walker, V.; Cezard, G.; Knight, R.; Al Arab, M.; Wei, Y.; Horne, E. M.

C.; Denholm, R.; CONVALESCENCE Long-COVID study, ; Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing and Data and Connectivity UK COVID-19 National Core Studies, ; OpenSAFELY collaborative, Score: 754.2, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.23293778\nBackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence is increased after diagnosis of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear. MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type. FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19. InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea. Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population. Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained. No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia. Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable. We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection. Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.\nInfluence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection on COVID-19 Severity: Evidence from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative\nAuthors: Hendrix, N.; Sidky, H.; Sahner, D.; N3C Consortium, Score: 485.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293612\nBackgroundAs SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned from a pandemic to endemic disease, the majority of new infections have been among previously infected individuals. To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections. MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups. ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic. ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes? FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections. MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.\nPrevalence of long-term symptoms varies by using different post-COVID-19 definitions in positively and negatively tested adults: the PRIME post-COVID study\nAuthors: Pagen, D. M.; van Bilsen, C. J.; Brinkhues, S.; Van Herck, M.; Konings, K.; den Heijer, C. D.; ter Waarbeek, H. L.; Spruit, M. A.; Hoebe, C. J.; Dukers-Muijrers, N. H.\nScore: 79.1, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293244\nBackgroundLong-term symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID), constitute a substantial public health problem. Yet, the prevalence remains currently unclear as different case definitions are used, and negatively tested controls are lacking. We aimed to estimate post-COVID-19 condition prevalence using six definitions. MethodsThe Prevalence, Risk factors, and Impact Evaluation (PRIME) post-COVID-19 condition study is a population-based sample of COVID-19 tested adults. End 2021, 61,655 adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire, including 44 symptoms plus a severity score (0-10) per symptom. The prevalence was calculated in both positively and negatively tested adults, stratified by time since their COVID-19 test (3-5, 6-11 or [\u0026ge;]12 months ago). ResultsIn positives (n=7,405; 75.6%), the prevalence of long-term symptoms was between 26.9% and 64.1% using the six definitions, while in negatives (n=2,392; 24.4%) the prevalence varied between 11.4% and 32.5%. The prevalence of long-term symptoms potentially accountable to COVID-19 ranged from 17.9% to 26.3%. ConclusionThere is a (substantial) variation in prevalence estimates by using different definitions as is current practice, showing limited overlap between definitions, indicating that the essential post-COVID-19 condition criteria are still unclear. Including negatives is important to determine long-term symptoms accountable to COVID-19. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05128695.\nPost-acute health care costs following SARS-CoV-2 infection: A retrospective cohort study of among 531,182 matched adults\nAuthors: McNaughton, C. D.; Austin, P. C.; Li, Z.; Sivaswamy, A.; Fang, T.; Abdel-Qadir, H.; Udell, J. A.; Wodchis, W.; Lee, D. S.; Mostarac, I.; Atzema, C. L.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293563\nPost-acute health care costs following SARS-CoV-2 infection are not known. Beginning 56 days following SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, we compared person-specific total and component health care costs across their distribution for the following year (test-positive versus test-negative, matched people; January 1, 2020-March 31, 2021). For 531,182 individuals, mean person-specific total health care costs were $513.83 (95% CI $387.37-$638.40) higher for test-positive females and $459.10 (95% CI $304.60-$615.32) higher for test-positive males, or \u003e10% increase in mean per-capita costs, driven by hospitalization, long-term care, and complex continuing care costs. At the 99th percentile of each subgroup, person-specific health care costs were $12,533.00 (95% CI $9,008.50-$16,473.00) higher for test-positive females and $14,604.00 (95% CI $9,565.50-$19,506.50) for test-positive males, driven by hospitalization, specialist (males), and homecare costs (females). Cancer costs were lower. Six-month and 1-year costs differences were similar. These findings can inform planning for post-acute SARS-CoV-2 health care costs.\nIdentifying proteomic risk factors for cancer using prospective and exome analyses: 1,463 circulating proteins and risk of 19 cancers in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Papier, K.; Atkins, J. R.; Tong, T. Y.; Gaitskell, K.; Desai, T.; Ogamba, C. F.; Parsaeian, M.; Reeves, G. K.; Mills, I. G.; Key, T. J.; Smith-Byrne, K.; Travis, R. C.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.23293330\nBackgroundProteins are essential for the development and progression of cancer and for the human bodys defense against tumor onset. The availability of a large panel of protein measurements and whole exome sequence data in the UK Biobank has enabled the simultaneous examination of plasma protein associations with risk across multiple cancer sites and their potential role in cancer etiology. MethodsWe investigated the associations of plasma proteins with incidence of 19 cancers and 9 cancer subsites in up to 44,645 middle-aged adults in the UK Biobank, who had measurements of 1,463 plasma proteins generated using Olink Explore Proximity Extension Assay in baseline blood samples (2006-2010). Using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression, we estimated the risk of each protein with each cancer overall and by time-to-diagnosis after correction for multiple-testing. Identified protein-cancer associations were further assessed in an analysis of cancer risk using cis-pQTL and exome-wide protein genetic scores (exGS) in all UK Biobank participants (n=337,543). ResultsWe identified 371 proteins associated with the risk of at least one incident cancer, represented by a total of 621 protein-cancer associations. These proteins were associated with cancers of the blood (201 proteins), liver (131), kidney (51), lung (28), esophagus (22), colorectum (15), stomach (8), breast (5), prostate (3), endometrium (3), ovary (2), bladder (1), head and neck (1), and brain (1). 100 of these 621 protein-cancer associations persisted for cases diagnosed more than seven years after blood draw. Of these 621 associations, there was further support from cis-pQTL analyses for the etiological role of TNFRSF14 in risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and from whole exome protein score (exGS) analyses for 28 other protein-cancer associations, including SRP14 and risk of leukemia. Proteins with directionally concordant evidence from long time-to-diagnosis analyses and from both cis-pQTL and exGS analyses were SFTPA2 for lung cancer, TNFRSF1B and CD74 for NHL, and ADAM8 for leukemia. ConclusionsFor the first time using an integrated multi-omics and cross-cancer approach, we have comprehensively assessed the plasma proteome in relation to cancer risk and identified multiple novel etiological candidates. Differences in the levels of many circulating proteins were detectable more than seven years before cancer diagnosis; while some of these are likely to be markers of early cancer processes that may inform risk stratification, and/or risk factors, concordant evidence from genetic analyses suggests that some may have a role in cancer development.\nExploring pleiotropy in Mendelian randomisation analyses: What are genetic variants associated with \"cigarette smoking initiation\" really capturing?\nAuthors: Reed, Z. E.; Wootton, R. E.; Khouja, J. N.; Richardson, T. G.; Sanderson, E. G.; Davey Smith, G.; Munafo, M. R.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.23293638\nBackgroundGenetic variants used as instruments for exposures in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses may also have horizontal pleiotropic effects (i.e., influence outcomes via pathways other than through the exposure), which can undermine the validity of results. We examined the extent to which horizontal pleiotropy may be present, using smoking behaviours as an example. MethodsWe first ran a phenome-wide association study in UK Biobank, using a genetic instrument for smoking initiation. From the most strongly associated phenotypes, we selected those that we considered could either plausibly or not plausibly be caused by smoking. We next examined the association between genetic instruments for smoking initiation, smoking heaviness and lifetime smoking and these phenotypes in both UK Biobank and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We conducted negative control analyses among never smokers, including children in ALSPAC. ResultsWe found evidence that smoking-related genetic instruments (mainly for smoking initiation and lifetime smoking) were associated with phenotypes not plausibly caused by smoking in UK Biobank and (to a lesser extent) ALSPAC, although this may reflect the much smaller sample size in ALSPAC. We also observed associations with several phenotypes among never smokers. ConclusionOur results suggest that genetic instruments for smoking-related phenotypes demonstrate horizontal pleiotropy. When using genetic variants - particularly those for complex behavioural exposures - in genetically-informed causal inference analyses (e.g., MR) it is important to include negative control outcomes where possible, and other triangulation approaches, to avoid arriving at incorrect conclusions.\nUS Exceptionalism? International Trends in Midlife Mortality\nAuthors: Dowd, J. B.; Doniec, K.; Zhang, L.; Tilstra, A.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293099\nBackgroundRising midlife mortality in the United States (US) has raised concerns, particularly the increase in \"deaths of despair\" (due to drugs, alcohol, and suicide). While life expectancy is also stalling in other countries such as the UK, whether midlife mortality is rising outside the US is not known. MethodsWe document trends in midlife mortality in the US, UK and a group of 16 high-income countries in Western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan, as well as 7 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries from 1990-2019. We use annual mortality data from the World Health Organization Mortality Database to analyze sex and age-specific (25-44, 45-54, and 55-64) age-standardized death rates across 13 major cause-of-death categories. FindingsUS midlife mortality rates worsened since 1990 for several causes of death including drug- related, alcohol-related, suicide, metabolic disease, nervous system disease, respiratory disease, and infectious/parasitic diseases. Deaths due to homicide, transport accidents, and cardiovascular disease declined overall since 1990 but saw recent increases or stalling of improvements. Midlife mortality has also recently increased in the UK for 45-54-year-olds, and in Canada, Poland, and Sweden among 25-44-year-olds. ConclusionThe US is increasingly falling behind not only high-income but also CEE countries heavily impacted by the post-Soviet mortality crisis of the 1990s. While levels of midlife mortality in the UK are substantially lower than in the US overall, there are signs that UK midlife mortality is worsening relative to the rest of Europe.\nLineage replacement and evolution captured by the United Kingdom Covid Infection Survey\nAuthors: Lythgoe, K.

S.; Bonsall, D.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2022.01.05.21268323\nThe Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (ONS-CIS) is the largest surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the community, and collected data on the United Kingdom (UK) epidemic from April 2020 until March 2023 before being paused. Here, we report on the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 determined by analysing the sequenced samples collected by the ONS-CIS during this period. We observed a series of sweeps or partial sweeps, with each sweeping lineage having a distinct growth advantage compared to their predecessors. The sweeps also generated an alternating pattern in which most samples had either S-gene target failure (SGTF) or non- SGTF over time. Evolution was characterised by steadily increasing divergence and diversity within lineages, but with step increases in divergence associated with each sweeping major lineage. This led to a faster overall rate of evolution when measured at the between-lineage level compared to within lineages, and fluctuating levels of diversity. These observations highlight the value of viral sequencing integrated into community surveillance studies to monitor the viral epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other pathogens, particularly in the current phase of the pandemic with routine RT-PCR testing now ended in the community.\nFacilitating youth diabetes studies with the most comprehensive epidemiological dataset available through a public web portal\nAuthors: McDonough, C.; Li, Y. C.; Vangeepuram, N.; Liu, B.; Pandey, G.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293517\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes (preDM) is rapidly increasing among youth, posing significant health and economic consequences. To address this growing concern, we created the most comprehensive youth-focused diabetes dataset to date derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2018. The dataset, consisting of 15,149 youth aged 12 to 19 years, encompasses preDM/DM relevant variables from sociodemographic, health status, diet, and other lifestyle behavior domains. An interactive web portal, POND (Prediabetes/diabetes in youth ONline Dashboard), was developed to provide public access to the dataset, allowing users to explore variables potentially associated with youth preDM/DM. Leveraging statistical and machine learning methods, we conducted two case studies, revealing established and lesser-known variables linked to youth preDM/DM. This dataset and portal can facilitate future studies to inform prevention and management strategies for youth prediabetes and diabetes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo characterise Long COVID in a highly vaccinated population infected by Omicron.

DesignFollow-up survey of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Western Australia, 16 July-3 August 2022.

SettingCommunity

Participants22,744 persons with COVID-19 who had agreed to participate in research at the time of diagnosis were texted a survey link 90 days later; non-responders were telephoned. Post stratification weights were applied to responses from 11,697 (51.4%) participants, 94.0% of whom had received &gt;= 3 vaccine doses.

Main outcome measuresPrevalence of  Long COVID - defined as reporting new or ongoing COVID-19 illness-related symptoms or health issues 90 days post diagnosis; associated health care utilisation, reductions in work/study and risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression.

Results18.2% (n=2,130) of respondents met case definition for Long COVID. Female sex, being 50-69 years of age, pre-existing health issues, residing in a rural or remote area, and receiving fewer vaccine doses were significant independent predictors of Long COVID (p &lt; 0.05). Persons with Long COVID reported a median of 6 symptoms, most commonly fatigue (70.6%) and difficulty concentrating (59.6%); 38.2% consulted a GP and 1.6% reported hospitalisation in the month prior to the survey due to ongoing symptoms. Of 1,778 respondents with Long COVID who were working/studying before their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17.9% reported reducing/discontinuing work/study.

Conclusion90 days post Omicron infection, almost 1 in 5 respondents reported Long COVID symptoms; 1 in 15 of all persons with COVID-19 sought healthcare for associated health concerns &gt;=2 months after the acute illness.

Significance of the studyO_ST_ABSThe knownC_ST_ABSThe prevalence of Long COVID varies widely across studies conducted in diverse settings globally (range: 9%-81%).

The newIn a highly vaccinated population (94% with &gt;=3 vaccine doses), almost 20% of persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant reported symptoms consistent with Long COVID 90 days post diagnosis. Long COVID was associated with sustained negative impacts on work/study and a substantial utilisation of GP services 2-3 months after the acute illness; however, ED presentations and hospitalisations for Long COVID were rare.

The implicationsGP clinics play a significant role in managing the burden of Long COVID in Australia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2DM) incidence is increased after diagnosis of COVID-19. The impact of vaccination on this increase, for how long it persists, and the effect of COVID-19 on other types of diabetes remain unclear.

MethodsWith NHS England approval, we studied diabetes incidence following COVID-19 diagnosis in pre-vaccination (N=15,211,471, January 2020-December 2021), vaccinated (N =11,822,640), and unvaccinated (N=2,851,183) cohorts (June-December 2021), using linked electronic health records. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing diabetes incidence post-COVID-19 diagnosis with incidence before or without diagnosis up to 102 weeks post-diagnosis. Results were stratified by COVID-19 severity (hospitalised/non-hospitalised) and diabetes type.

FindingsIn the pre-vaccination cohort, aHRS for T2DM incidence after COVID-19 (compared to before or without diagnosis) declined from 3.01 (95% CI: 2.76,3.28) in weeks 1-4 to 1.24 (1.12,1.38) in weeks 53-102. aHRS were higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated people (4.86 (3.69,6.41)) versus 1.42 (1.24,1.62) in weeks 1-4) and for hospitalised COVID-19 (pre-vaccination cohort 21.1 (18.8,23.7) in weeks 1-4 declining to 2.04 (1.65,2.51) in weeks 52-102), than non-hospitalised COVID-19 (1.45 (1.27,1.64) in weeks 1-4, 1.10 (0.98,1.23) in weeks 52-102). T2DM persisted for 4 months after COVID-19 for [~]73% of those diagnosed. Patterns were similar for Type 1 diabetes, though excess incidence did not persist beyond a year post-COVID-19.

InterpretationElevated T2DM incidence after COVID-19 is greater, and persists longer, in hospitalised than non-hospitalised people. It is markedly less apparent post-vaccination. Testing for T2DM after severe COVID-19 and promotion of vaccination are important tools in addressing this public health problem.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for population-based observational studies published between December 1st 2019 and July 12th 2023 examining associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 diagnosis (search string: SARS-CoV-2 or COVID* or coronavirus*) and subsequent incident diabetes (search term: diabetes). Of nineteen relevant studies; eight had a composite outcome of diabetes types, six stratified by diabetes type and five pertained to type-1-diabetes (T1DM) only. We did not identify any studies relating to gestational or other types of diabetes. Eleven studies were from the US, three from the UK, two from Germany, one from Canada, one from Denmark and one from South Korea.

Most studies described cumulative relative risks (for infection versus no infection) one to two years post-SARS-CoV-2 infection of 1.2 to 2.6, though four studies found no associations with T1DM after the post-acute period. All studies lacked the power to compare diabetes relative risk by type, severity, and vaccination status in population subgroups. One study examined relative risks by vaccination status, but this used a composite outcome of diabetes and hyperlipidaemia and was conducted in a predominantly white male population.

Two studies of T1DM found no evidence of elevated risk beyond 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, whilst two reported elevated risks at six months. Two studies of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) examined relative risks by time period post-infection: one study of US insurance claims reported a persistent association six months post-infection, whereas a large UK population-based study reported no associations after 12 weeks. However, the latter study used only primary care data, therefore COVID-19 cases were likely to have been under-ascertained.

No large studies have investigated the persistence of diabetes diagnosed following COVID-19; key to elucidating the role of stress/steroid-induced hyperglycaemia.

Added value of this studyThis study, which is the largest to address the question to date, analysed linked primary and secondary care health records with SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 vaccination data for 15 million people living in England. This enabled us to compare the elevation in diabetes incidence after COVID-19 diagnosis by diabetes type, COVID-19 severity and vaccination status, overall and in population subgroups. Importantly, excess diabetes incidence by time period since infection could also be quantified. Since healthcare in the UK is universal and free-at-the-point-of-delivery, almost the entire population is registered with primary care. Therefore the findings are likely to be generalisable.

We found that, before availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a COVID-19 diagnosis (vs. no diagnosis) was associated with increased T2DM incidence which remained elevated by approximately 30% beyond one year after diagnosis. Though still present (with around 30% excess incidence at eight weeks), these associations were substantially attenuated in unvaccinated compared with vaccinated people. Excess incidence was greater in people hospitalised with COVID-19 than those who were not hospitalised after diagnosis. T1DM incidence was elevated up to, but not beyond, a year post COVID-19. Around 73% of people diagnosed with incident T2DM after COVID-19 still had evidence of diabetes four months after infection.

Implications of all the available evidenceThere is a 30-50% elevated T2DM incidence post-COVID-19, but we report the novel finding that there is elevated incidence beyond one-year post-diagnosis. Elevated T1DM incidence did not appear to persist beyond a year, which may explain why previous studies disagree. For the first time in a general-population dataset, we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces, but does not entirely ameliorate, excess diabetes incidence after COVID-19. This supports a policy of universal vaccination and suggests that other public health activities, such as enhanced diabetes screening after severe COVID-19, may be warranted, particularly in unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs SARS-CoV-2 has transitioned from a pandemic to endemic disease, the majority of new infections have been among previously infected individuals. To manage the risks and benefits of ongoing COVID-19 policies, it is important to understand whether prior infection modifies the severity of subsequent infections.

MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a collection of health systems who provide de-identified electronic health records for research purposes. Our analysis was a sequential series of nested trial emulations. In the first of two analytic stages, we created a month-specific model of the probability of prior infection for each individual. In the second stage, we used an ordinal logistic regression with inverse probability weights calculated in the first stage to simulate a series of monthly trials comparing severity between the cohorts of first and second infections. In addition to cohort-wide effect estimates, we also conducted analyses among race/ethnicity, sex, and age subgroups.

ResultsFrom an initial cohort of 7,446,481 combined first and second infections, we identified a cohort of 2,227,484 infections, among which 7.6% were second infections. Ninety-four percent of patients with two recorded infections experienced mild disease for both. The overall odds ratio (OR) for more severe disease with prior infection was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 - 1.10). Monthly point estimates of the OR ranged from 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37 - 0.84) in October 2020 to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.33 - 2.00) in February 2023. In most subgroups, the effect of prior infection was significant. In 8 out of 10 subgroups, the maximum monthly OR occurred after the minimum monthly OR, suggesting that protection has waned throughout the pandemic.

ConclusionOverall, prior infection was associated with a significant slightly elevated risk of severe disease. This effect varied month to month. As the pandemic proceeded, the effect of prior infection tended to evolve from generally protective during the pre-Omicron era to unprotective during the Omicron era. This points to the need for continued strategies to avert and minimize the harms of COVID-19, rather than relying upon immunity acquired through previous infection.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 affect the severity of subsequent COVID-19 episodes?

FindingsWe observed a mild protective effect of prior infection during the early and mid-stages of the pandemic that waned after the rise of the Omicron variants, ultimately resulting in loss of protection or a tendency toward more severe second infections.

MeaningPrior infection alone is likely not enough to avert the worst public health harms of endemic SARS-CoV-2. Interventions to avoid infection and reduce the severity of COVID-19 will still be important in the post-pandemic era.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong-term symptoms after a SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., post-COVID-19 condition or long COVID), constitute a substantial public health problem. Yet, the prevalence remains currently unclear as different case definitions are used, and negatively tested controls are lacking. We aimed to estimate post-COVID-19 condition prevalence using six definitions.

MethodsThe Prevalence, Risk factors, and Impact Evaluation (PRIME) post-COVID-19 condition study is a population-based sample of COVID-19 tested adults. End 2021, 61,655 adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire, including 44 symptoms plus a severity score (0-10) per symptom. The prevalence was calculated in both positively and negatively tested adults, stratified by time since their COVID-19 test (3-5, 6-11 or [&amp;ge;]12 months ago).

ResultsIn positives (n=7,405; 75.6%), the prevalence of long-term symptoms was between 26.9% and 64.1% using the six definitions, while in negatives (n=2,392; 24.4%) the prevalence varied between 11.4% and 32.5%. The prevalence of long-term symptoms potentially accountable to COVID-19 ranged from 17.9% to 26.3%.

ConclusionThere is a (substantial) variation in prevalence estimates by using different definitions as is current practice, showing limited overlap between definitions, indicating that the essential post-COVID-19 condition criteria are still unclear. Including negatives is important to determine long-term symptoms accountable to COVID-19.

        <p class="abstract">Post-acute health care costs following SARS-CoV-2 infection are not known. Beginning 56 days following SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, we compared person-specific total and component health care costs across their distribution for the following year (test-positive versus test-negative, matched people; January 1, 2020-March 31, 2021). For 531,182 individuals, mean person-specific total health care costs were $513.83 (95% CI $387.37-$638.40) higher for test-positive females and $459.10 (95% CI $304.60-$615.32) higher for test-positive males, or &gt;10% increase in mean per-capita costs, driven by hospitalization, long-term care, and complex continuing care costs. At the 99th percentile of each subgroup, person-specific health care costs were $12,533.00 (95% CI $9,008.50-$16,473.00) higher for test-positive females and $14,604.00 (95% CI $9,565.50-$19,506.50) for test-positive males, driven by hospitalization, specialist (males), and homecare costs (females). Cancer costs were lower. Six-month and 1-year costs differences were similar. These findings can inform planning for post-acute SARS-CoV-2 health care costs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundProteins are essential for the development and progression of cancer and for the human bodys defense against tumor onset. The availability of a large panel of protein measurements and whole exome sequence data in the UK Biobank has enabled the simultaneous examination of plasma protein associations with risk across multiple cancer sites and their potential role in cancer etiology.

MethodsWe investigated the associations of plasma proteins with incidence of 19 cancers and 9 cancer subsites in up to 44,645 middle-aged adults in the UK Biobank, who had measurements of 1,463 plasma proteins generated using Olink Explore Proximity Extension Assay in baseline blood samples (2006-2010). Using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression, we estimated the risk of each protein with each cancer overall and by time-to-diagnosis after correction for multiple-testing. Identified protein-cancer associations were further assessed in an analysis of cancer risk using cis-pQTL and exome-wide protein genetic scores (exGS) in all UK Biobank participants (n=337,543).

ResultsWe identified 371 proteins associated with the risk of at least one incident cancer, represented by a total of 621 protein-cancer associations. These proteins were associated with cancers of the blood (201 proteins), liver (131), kidney (51), lung (28), esophagus (22), colorectum (15), stomach (8), breast (5), prostate (3), endometrium (3), ovary (2), bladder (1), head and neck (1), and brain (1). 100 of these 621 protein-cancer associations persisted for cases diagnosed more than seven years after blood draw. Of these 621 associations, there was further support from cis-pQTL analyses for the etiological role of TNFRSF14 in risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and from whole exome protein score (exGS) analyses for 28 other protein-cancer associations, including SRP14 and risk of leukemia. Proteins with directionally concordant evidence from long time-to-diagnosis analyses and from both cis-pQTL and exGS analyses were SFTPA2 for lung cancer, TNFRSF1B and CD74 for NHL, and ADAM8 for leukemia.

ConclusionsFor the first time using an integrated multi-omics and cross-cancer approach, we have comprehensively assessed the plasma proteome in relation to cancer risk and identified multiple novel etiological candidates. Differences in the levels of many circulating proteins were detectable more than seven years before cancer diagnosis; while some of these are likely to be markers of early cancer processes that may inform risk stratification, and/or risk factors, concordant evidence from genetic analyses suggests that some may have a role in cancer development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGenetic variants used as instruments for exposures in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses may also have horizontal pleiotropic effects (i.e., influence outcomes via pathways other than through the exposure), which can undermine the validity of results. We examined the extent to which horizontal pleiotropy may be present, using smoking behaviours as an example.

MethodsWe first ran a phenome-wide association study in UK Biobank, using a genetic instrument for smoking initiation. From the most strongly associated phenotypes, we selected those that we considered could either plausibly or not plausibly be caused by smoking. We next examined the association between genetic instruments for smoking initiation, smoking heaviness and lifetime smoking and these phenotypes in both UK Biobank and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We conducted negative control analyses among never smokers, including children in ALSPAC.

ResultsWe found evidence that smoking-related genetic instruments (mainly for smoking initiation and lifetime smoking) were associated with phenotypes not plausibly caused by smoking in UK Biobank and (to a lesser extent) ALSPAC, although this may reflect the much smaller sample size in ALSPAC. We also observed associations with several phenotypes among never smokers.

ConclusionOur results suggest that genetic instruments for smoking-related phenotypes demonstrate horizontal pleiotropy. When using genetic variants - particularly those for complex behavioural exposures - in genetically-informed causal inference analyses (e.g., MR) it is important to include negative control outcomes where possible, and other triangulation approaches, to avoid arriving at incorrect conclusions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRising midlife mortality in the United States (US) has raised concerns, particularly the increase in &#34;deaths of despair&#34; (due to drugs, alcohol, and suicide). While life expectancy is also stalling in other countries such as the UK, whether midlife mortality is rising outside the US is not known.

MethodsWe document trends in midlife mortality in the US, UK and a group of 16 high-income countries in Western Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan, as well as 7 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries from 1990-2019. We use annual mortality data from the World Health Organization Mortality Database to analyze sex and age-specific (25-44, 45-54, and 55-64) age-standardized death rates across 13 major cause-of-death categories.

FindingsUS midlife mortality rates worsened since 1990 for several causes of death including drug- related, alcohol-related, suicide, metabolic disease, nervous system disease, respiratory disease, and infectious/parasitic diseases. Deaths due to homicide, transport accidents, and cardiovascular disease declined overall since 1990 but saw recent increases or stalling of improvements. Midlife mortality has also recently increased in the UK for 45-54-year-olds, and in Canada, Poland, and Sweden among 25-44-year-olds.

ConclusionThe US is increasingly falling behind not only high-income but also CEE countries heavily impacted by the post-Soviet mortality crisis of the 1990s. While levels of midlife mortality in the UK are substantially lower than in the US overall, there are signs that UK midlife mortality is worsening relative to the rest of Europe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (ONS-CIS) is the largest surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the community, and collected data on the United Kingdom (UK) epidemic from April 2020 until March 2023 before being paused. Here, we report on the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 determined by analysing the sequenced samples collected by the ONS-CIS during this period. We observed a series of sweeps or partial sweeps, with each sweeping lineage having a distinct growth advantage compared to their predecessors. The sweeps also generated an alternating pattern in which most samples had either S-gene target failure (SGTF) or non- SGTF over time. Evolution was characterised by steadily increasing divergence and diversity within lineages, but with step increases in divergence associated with each sweeping major lineage. This led to a faster overall rate of evolution when measured at the between-lineage level compared to within lineages, and fluctuating levels of diversity. These observations highlight the value of viral sequencing integrated into community surveillance studies to monitor the viral epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other pathogens, particularly in the current phase of the pandemic with routine RT-PCR testing now ended in the community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes (preDM) is rapidly increasing among youth, posing significant health and economic consequences. To address this growing concern, we created the most comprehensive youth-focused diabetes dataset to date derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2018. The dataset, consisting of 15,149 youth aged 12 to 19 years, encompasses preDM/DM relevant variables from sociodemographic, health status, diet, and other lifestyle behavior domains. An interactive web portal, POND (Prediabetes/diabetes in youth ONline Dashboard), was developed to provide public access to the dataset, allowing users to explore variables potentially associated with youth preDM/DM. Leveraging statistical and machine learning methods, we conducted two case studies, revealing established and lesser-known variables linked to youth preDM/DM. This dataset and portal can facilitate future studies to inform prevention and management strategies for youth prediabetes and diabetes.</p>
