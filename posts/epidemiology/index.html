MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020. ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices. ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with \"long COVID\" to minimize road use. What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations. What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with \"long covid\" about road risk is warranted.\nAssociation between common adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands\nAuthors: Holwerda, M. R.; Hoeve, C. E.; Huiberts, A. J.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.; van den Hof, S.; Knol, M.\nScore: 142.8, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297194\nINTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations. METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination. RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (\u003c60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54). CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.\nEvaluation of Stroke Risk Following COVID-19 mRNA Bivalent Vaccines Among U.S. Adults Aged \u003e=65 Years\nAuthors: Lu, Y.; Matuska, K.; Nadimpalli, G.; Ma, Y.; Duma, N.; Zhang, H.; Chiang, Y.; Lyu, H.; Chillarige, Y.; Forshee, R. A.; Anderson, S. A.\nScore: 39.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nCovid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, a nested case-control study in births from April 2021 to March 2022, England\nAuthors: Mensah, A. A.; Stowe, J.; Jardine, J. E.; Kirsebom, F. C.; Clare, T.; Kall, M.; Campbell, H.; Lopez-Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.\nScore: 35.1, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296737\nIntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception. Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes. What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants. What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer. How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.\nInferring Viral Transmission Pathways from Within-Host Variation\nAuthors: Specht, I. O. A.; Petros, B. A.; Moreno, G. K.; Brock-Fisher, T.; Krasilnikova, L. A.; Schifferli, M.; Yang, K.; Cronan, P.; Glennon, O.; Schaffner, S. F.; Park, D. J.; MacInnis, B. L.; Ozonoff, A.; Fry, B.; Mitzenmacher, M. D.; Varilly, P.; Sabeti, P. C.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.23297039\nGenome sequencing can offer critical insight into pathogen spread in viral outbreaks, but existing transmission inference methods use simplistic evolutionary models and only incorporate a portion of available genetic data. Here, we develop a robust evolutionary model for transmission reconstruction that tracks the genetic composition of within-host viral populations over time and the lineages transmitted between hosts. We confirm that our model reliably describes within-host variant frequencies in a dataset of 134,682 SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequenced genomes from Massachusetts, USA. We then demonstrate that our reconstruction approach infers transmissions more accurately than two leading methods on synthetic data, as well as in a controlled outbreak of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and an epidemiologically-investigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in South Africa. Finally, we apply our transmission reconstruction tool to 5,692 outbreaks among the 134,682 Massachusetts genomes. Our methods and results demonstrate the utility of within-host variation for transmission inference of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and provide an adaptable mathematical framework for tracking within-host evolution.\nHormonal Contraceptives are Shaping the Human Plasma Proteome in a Large Population Cohort\nAuthors: Dordevic, N.; Dierks, C.; Hantikainen, E.; Farztdinov, V.; Amari, F.; Verri Hernandes, V.; De Grandi, A.; Domingues, F. S.; Mülleder, M.; Pramstaller, P. P.; Rainer, J.; Ralser, M.\nScore: 28.1, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296871\nLarge-scale plasma proteomics in population studies offer new avenues to explore non-genetic associations, such as biomarkers for lifestyle and environmental exposure. Moreover, through longitudinal monitoring, they help in characterizing the onset and progression of diseases. Utilizing the SWATH DIA-MS-based proteomic approach with 5-minute chromatographic gradients, we examined the neat plasma proteome of 3,632 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. We present precise protein quantities for 148 highly abundant plasma protein groups. Many of these proteins are challenging to quantify using affinity-based reagents. This set of highly abundant plasma proteins includes immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, metabolic proteins, and components of the innate immune system, such as the complement system. Our findings indicate that, beyond age and sex, the most significant biological variable affecting the plasma proteome was the use of hormonal contraceptives. The signature from this drug class was more pronounced compared to other common medications, which influenced only a subset of the measured proteins and exhibited smaller effect sizes. Notably, Angiotensinogen (AGT) levels were strongly influenced by contraceptive use, suggesting that AGT levels might serve as a potential biomarker for contraceptive usage. Due to its high prevalence, and apparently strong influence, this type of medication should be accounted for in any epidemiological or clinical study of the plasma proteome to avoid spurious findings.

S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297270\nCOVID-19 testing policies varied in time from testing only the symptomatic, testing the symptomatic and persons at higher risk of severe disease, on-demand testing for people who wanted one, and two periods of government-imposed mass testing in Slovakia. Using Poisson regression, this study examines the associations of COVID-19 cases during the times that the noted policies were in effect in 34 countries rated highest on democracy scores. Statistically corrected for other risk factors, increases in negative tests were associated with subsequent surges in cases when on-demand testing was promoted, particularly when coupled with poor contact tracing. Mass testing in Slovakia was associated with reduced spread of the virus for short periods but was deemed unsustainable. The data support the hypothesis that on-demand testing resulted in the unanticipated consequence of increased travel and increased exposure of travelers to the virus.\nTrends in Nationally Notifiable Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea\nAuthors: Chang, T.; Cho, S.-i.; Yoo, D.-s.; Min, K.-D.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297064\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented to cope with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. These interventions could also have affected other infectious diseases, but there have been no comprehensive studies regarding their impacts. This study examined trends in notifiable infectious diseases in both humans and animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed for each disease using data from 2016 to 2019, and the incidences for 2020 to 2021 were predicted. Subsequently, the predicted numbers of cases were compared with actual observations. Our findings indicated a substantial reduction in human respiratory infectious diseases during implementation of NPIs. However, human gastrointestinal infectious diseases and livestock diseases did not show a significant decrease. The results revealed that the preventive effect sizes of NPIs varied among diseases and indicated the potential for side effects, suggesting that complementary interventions are needed to minimize these negative effects.\nHow demographic factors matter for antimicrobial resistance - quantification of the patterns and impact of variation in prevalence of resistance by age and sex.\nAuthors: Waterlow, N. R.; Cooper, B. S.; Robotham, J. V.; Knight, G. M.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23296060\nBackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values. In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation. ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40. At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli. ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.\nSnoring and risk of dementia: a prospective cohort and Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Gao, Y.; Andrews, S.; Brenowitz, W.; Raji, C. A.; Yaffe, K.; Leng, Y.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296972\nBackgroundThe association between snoring, a very common condition that increases with age, and dementia risk is controversial. Snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiometabolic conditions, both of which are associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, snoring also increases with body mass index (BMI), which in late life is linked to lower dementia risk, possibly due to metabolic changes during prodromal dementia. MethodsThe prospective cohort study used data from 450,027 UK Biobank participants with snoring measured at baseline (2006 - 2010), and followed up for dementia diagnosis (censored at 2022). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis used summary statistics for genome-wide association studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) (n = 94,437; cases = 35,274) and snoring (n = 408,317; snorers = 151,011). ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 7,937 individuals developed dementia. Snoring was associated with an 8% lower risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and AD (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). The association was stronger in older individuals, APOE {varepsilon}4 allele carriers, and during shorter follow-up periods. MR analyses suggested no causal effect of snoring on AD, however, genetic liability to AD was associated with a lower risk of snoring. Multivariable MR indicated that the effect of AD on snoring was primarily driven by BMI. ConclusionsThe phenotypic association between snoring and lower dementia risk likely stems from reverse causation, with genetic predisposition to AD associated with reduced snoring. This may be driven by weight loss in prodromal AD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine data on COVID-19 disease associated with a 10 percent increase in U.S. road deaths from 2020 to 2021 that raises the question of the potential effect of pandemic stress and neurological damage from COVID-19 disease.

MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020.

ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices.

ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with &#34;long COVID&#34; to minimize road use.

What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations.

What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with &#34;long covid&#34; about road risk is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations.

METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination.

RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (&lt;60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54).

CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy.

MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception.

Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95).

ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.

What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants.

What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genome sequencing can offer critical insight into pathogen spread in viral outbreaks, but existing transmission inference methods use simplistic evolutionary models and only incorporate a portion of available genetic data. Here, we develop a robust evolutionary model for transmission reconstruction that tracks the genetic composition of within-host viral populations over time and the lineages transmitted between hosts. We confirm that our model reliably describes within-host variant frequencies in a dataset of 134,682 SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequenced genomes from Massachusetts, USA. We then demonstrate that our reconstruction approach infers transmissions more accurately than two leading methods on synthetic data, as well as in a controlled outbreak of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and an epidemiologically-investigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in South Africa. Finally, we apply our transmission reconstruction tool to 5,692 outbreaks among the 134,682 Massachusetts genomes. Our methods and results demonstrate the utility of within-host variation for transmission inference of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and provide an adaptable mathematical framework for tracking within-host evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large-scale plasma proteomics in population studies offer new avenues to explore non-genetic associations, such as biomarkers for lifestyle and environmental exposure. Moreover, through longitudinal monitoring, they help in characterizing the onset and progression of diseases. Utilizing the SWATH DIA-MS-based proteomic approach with 5-minute chromatographic gradients, we examined the neat plasma proteome of 3,632 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. We present precise protein quantities for 148 highly abundant plasma protein groups. Many of these proteins are challenging to quantify using affinity-based reagents. This set of highly abundant plasma proteins includes immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, metabolic proteins, and components of the innate immune system, such as the complement system. Our findings indicate that, beyond age and sex, the most significant biological variable affecting the plasma proteome was the use of hormonal contraceptives. The signature from this drug class was more pronounced compared to other common medications, which influenced only a subset of the measured proteins and exhibited smaller effect sizes. Notably, Angiotensinogen (AGT) levels were strongly influenced by contraceptive use, suggesting that AGT levels might serve as a potential biomarker for contraceptive usage. Due to its high prevalence, and apparently strong influence, this type of medication should be accounted for in any epidemiological or clinical study of the plasma proteome to avoid spurious findings.

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 testing policies varied in time from testing only the symptomatic, testing the symptomatic and persons at higher risk of severe disease, on-demand testing for people who wanted one, and two periods of government-imposed mass testing in Slovakia. Using Poisson regression, this study examines the associations of COVID-19 cases during the times that the noted policies were in effect in 34 countries rated highest on democracy scores. Statistically corrected for other risk factors, increases in negative tests were associated with subsequent surges in cases when on-demand testing was promoted, particularly when coupled with poor contact tracing. Mass testing in Slovakia was associated with reduced spread of the virus for short periods but was deemed unsustainable. The data support the hypothesis that on-demand testing resulted in the unanticipated consequence of increased travel and increased exposure of travelers to the virus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented to cope with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. These interventions could also have affected other infectious diseases, but there have been no comprehensive studies regarding their impacts. This study examined trends in notifiable infectious diseases in both humans and animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed for each disease using data from 2016 to 2019, and the incidences for 2020 to 2021 were predicted. Subsequently, the predicted numbers of cases were compared with actual observations. Our findings indicated a substantial reduction in human respiratory infectious diseases during implementation of NPIs. However, human gastrointestinal infectious diseases and livestock diseases did not show a significant decrease. The results revealed that the preventive effect sizes of NPIs varied among diseases and indicated the potential for side effects, suggesting that complementary interventions are needed to minimize these negative effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values.

In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation.

ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40.

At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli.

ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe association between snoring, a very common condition that increases with age, and dementia risk is controversial. Snoring is linked to obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiometabolic conditions, both of which are associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, snoring also increases with body mass index (BMI), which in late life is linked to lower dementia risk, possibly due to metabolic changes during prodromal dementia.

MethodsThe prospective cohort study used data from 450,027 UK Biobank participants with snoring measured at baseline (2006 - 2010), and followed up for dementia diagnosis (censored at 2022). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis used summary statistics for genome-wide association studies of Alzheimers disease (AD) (n = 94,437; cases = 35,274) and snoring (n = 408,317; snorers = 151,011).

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 7,937 individuals developed dementia. Snoring was associated with an 8% lower risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88 to 0.97) and AD (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). The association was stronger in older individuals, APOE {varepsilon}4 allele carriers, and during shorter follow-up periods. MR analyses suggested no causal effect of snoring on AD, however, genetic liability to AD was associated with a lower risk of snoring. Multivariable MR indicated that the effect of AD on snoring was primarily driven by BMI.

ConclusionsThe phenotypic association between snoring and lower dementia risk likely stems from reverse causation, with genetic predisposition to AD associated with reduced snoring. This may be driven by weight loss in prodromal AD.</p>
