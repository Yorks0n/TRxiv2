We compared vaccination status of 2050 hospitalizations including 92 ICU admissions with age group-, sex-, region- and date-specific population vaccination coverage between 9 October and 5 December 2023. VE against hospitalization was 70.7% (95% CI: 66.6; 74.3), VE against ICU admission was 73.3% (95% CI: 42.2; 87.6).\nProtect or prevent? A practicable framework for the dilemmas of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization\nAuthors: Arghal, R.; Rubin, H.; Saeedi Bidokhti, S.; Sarkar, S.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.10.23299100\nDetermining COVID-19 vaccination strategies presents many challenges in light of limited vaccination capacity and the heterogeneity of affected communities. Who should be prioritized for early vaccination when different groups manifest different levels of risks and contact rates? Answering such questions often becomes computationally intractable given that network size can exceed millions. We obtain a framework to compute the optimal vaccination strategy within seconds to minutes from among all strategies, including highly dynamic ones that adjust vaccine allocation as often as required, and even with modest computation resources. We then determine the optimal strategy for a large range of parameter values representative of various US states, countries, and case studies including retirement homes and prisons. The optimal is almost always one of a few candidate strategies, and, even when not, the suboptimality of the best among these candidates is minimal. Further, we find that many commonly deployed vaccination strategies, such as vaccinating the high risk group first, or administering second doses without delay, can often incur higher death rates, hospitalizations, and symptomatic counts. Our framework can be easily adapted to future variants or pandemics through appropriate choice of the compartments of the disease and parameters.\nCombined multiplex panel test results are a poor estimate of disease prevalence without adjustment for test error.\nAuthors: Challen, R.; Chatzilena, A.; Qian, G.; Kwiatkowska, R.; Hyams, C.; Finn, A.; Tsaneva-Atanasova, K.; Danon, L.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299860\nMultiplex panel tests identify many individual pathogens at once, using a set of component tests. In some panels the number of components can be large. If the panel is detecting causative pathogens for a single syndrome or disease then we might estimate the burden of that disease by combining the results of the panel, for example determining the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia as caused by many individual pneumococcal serotypes. When we are dealing with multiplex test panels with many components, test error in the individual components of a panel, even when present at very low levels, can cause significant overall error. Uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests, and statistical fluctuations in the numbers of false positives and false negatives, will cause large uncertainty in the combined estimates of disease prevalence. In many cases this can be a source of significant bias. In this paper we develop a mathematical framework to characterise this issue, present novel statistical methods that adjust for this bias and quantify uncertainty, and use simulation to test these methods. As multiplex testing becomes more commonly used for screening in routine clinical practice, accumulation of test error due to the combination of large numbers of test results needs to be identified and corrected for. Author summaryDuring analysis of pneumococcal incidence data obtained from serotype specific multiplex urine antigen testing, we identified that despite excellent test sensitivity and specificity, the small error rate in each individual serotype test has the potential to compound and cause large uncertainty in the resulting estimates of pneumococcal prevalence, obtained by combining individual results. This limits the accuracy of estimates of the burden of disease caused by vaccine preventable pneumococcal serotypes, and in certain situations can produce marked bias.\nImpact of COVID-19 on mental illness in vaccinated and unvaccinated people: a population-based cohort study in OpenSAFELY\nAuthors: Walker, V.; Patalay, P.; Cuitin Coronado, J.

A.\nScore: 41.2, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299602\nBackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19. OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

V.; Yashkin, A. P.; Akushevich, I.; Arbeev, K. G.; Duan, H.; Gorbunova, G. A.; Stallard, P. J. E.; Yashin, A. I.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299092\nINTRODUCTIONDiverse pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) have been linked to Alzheimers disease (AD) indicating a possibility that the culprit may be compromised immunity rather than particular microbe. If true, then vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity might be protective against AD. METHODSWe estimated associations of common adult infections, including herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses, as well as vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risk of AD in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study. RESULTSShingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%. DISCUSSIONOur results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.\nThe duration of lithium use and biological ageing: telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age and all-cause mortality\nAuthors: Mutz, J.; Wong, W. L. E.; Powell, T. R.; Young, A. H.; Dawe, G. S.; Lewis, C. M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300105\nBackground: Lithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality. Methods: The UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality. Results: 591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality. Conclusions: We observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.\nGenetic evidence for efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6, and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Heikkila, T. E.; Kaiser, E. K.; Lin, J.; Gill, D.; Koskenniemi, J. J.; Karhunen, V.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300016\nBackground: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes. Methods: We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes. Findings: Colocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]). Interpretation: Our findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.\nLong-Term Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Variants and Other Respiratory Infections: Evidence from the Virus Watch Prospective Cohort in England\nAuthors: Beale, S.; Yavlinsky, A.; Fong, W. L. E.; Nguyen, V.; Kovar, J.; Vos, T.; Wulf Hansen, S.; Hayward, A.; Abubakar, I.; Aldridge, R. W.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300124\nBackground: Given the considerable prevalence of long-term sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding pathogen-related factors that influence long-term outcomes is warranted. We aimed to compare the likelihood of long-term symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 variants, other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and non-infected individuals. Method: Data were from 5,630 individuals participating in Virus Watch, a prospective community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in England. We used logistic regression to compare the predicted probability of developing long-term symptoms (\u003e2 months duration) during different variant dominance periods according to infection status (SARS-CoV-2, other ARI, or no infection), adjusting for confounding by demographic and clinical factors and vaccination status. Results: Predicted probability of long-term sequelae was greater following SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Wild Type (adjusted predicted probability (PP) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.14-0.43), Alpha (PP= 0.28, 95% CI =0.14-0.42), Delta (PP= 0.34, 95% CI =0.25-0.43) and Omicron BA.1 periods (PP= 0.27, 95% CI =0.22-0.33) compared to later Omicron sub-variants (PP range from 0.11, 95% CI 0.08-0.15 to 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.18). While differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs (PP range 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.11 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.28) varied by period, estimates for long-term symptoms following both infection types substantially exceeded those for non-infected participants (PP range 0.01, 95% CI 0.00,0.02 to 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) across all variant periods. Conclusions: Between-variant differences influenced the likelihood of post-infection sequelae for SARS-CoV-2, with lower predicted probabilities for recent Omicron sub-variants similar to those for other contemporaneous ARIs. Both SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs were associated with long-term symptom development, and further aetiological investigation including between-pathogen comparison is recommended.\nExpected and observed deaths in France from 2020 to 2022: accurately assessing the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period.\nAuthors: Moulaire, P.; Hejblum, G.; Lapidus, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299903\nBackgroundExcess mortality has been used worldwide for summarizing the COVID-19 pandemic-related burden. In France, the reported estimates for years 2020 and 2021 vary by a factor of three, and reported evolving trends for year 2022 are discordant. ObjectivesWe aimed at selecting the most appropriate modelling approach enabling an accurate estimation of the excess mortality in France during the 2020-2022 pandemic years. MethodBased on the 18,646,089 deaths that occurred In France between 1990 and 2023, the natural trend of age-and gender-specific death rates over time was considered according to three models which performances were compared for accurately predicting mortality data in the absence of pandemic perturbations. The best modelling approach was then used for estimating age-and gender-specific excess deaths and corresponding expected years of life lost in the individuals deceased in 2020, 2021, and 2022. ResultsA quadratic model trained with years 2010-2019 estimated that 49,352 [40,257; 58,165] (mean [95% confidence interval]), 43,028 [29,071; 56,381], and 54,373 [34,696; 73,187] excess deaths occurred in France in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Corresponding years of life lost rose over time with 503,289 [446,347; 561,415], 581,495 [493,911; 671,162], and 667 439 [544,196; 794,225] years of life lost for the individuals deceased in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. ConclusionThe study proposes a reliable method for accurately estimating excess mortality. Applying this method to the 2020-2022 years of the COVID-19 pandemic in France yielded estimates of excess mortality that peaked in year 2022.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Determining COVID-19 vaccination strategies presents many challenges in light of limited vaccination capacity and the heterogeneity of affected communities. Who should be prioritized for early vaccination when different groups manifest different levels of risks and contact rates? Answering such questions often becomes computationally intractable given that network size can exceed millions. We obtain a framework to compute the optimal vaccination strategy within seconds to minutes from among all strategies, including highly dynamic ones that adjust vaccine allocation as often as required, and even with modest computation resources. We then determine the optimal strategy for a large range of parameter values representative of various US states, countries, and case studies including retirement homes and prisons. The optimal is almost always one of a few candidate strategies, and, even when not, the suboptimality of the best among these candidates is minimal. Further, we find that many commonly deployed vaccination strategies, such as vaccinating the high risk group first, or administering second doses without delay, can often incur higher death rates, hospitalizations, and symptomatic counts. Our framework can be easily adapted to future variants or pandemics through appropriate choice of the compartments of the disease and parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiplex panel tests identify many individual pathogens at once, using a set of component tests. In some panels the number of components can be large. If the panel is detecting causative pathogens for a single syndrome or disease then we might estimate the burden of that disease by combining the results of the panel, for example determining the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia as caused by many individual pneumococcal serotypes. When we are dealing with multiplex test panels with many components, test error in the individual components of a panel, even when present at very low levels, can cause significant overall error. Uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests, and statistical fluctuations in the numbers of false positives and false negatives, will cause large uncertainty in the combined estimates of disease prevalence. In many cases this can be a source of significant bias. In this paper we develop a mathematical framework to characterise this issue, present novel statistical methods that adjust for this bias and quantify uncertainty, and use simulation to test these methods. As multiplex testing becomes more commonly used for screening in routine clinical practice, accumulation of test error due to the combination of large numbers of test results needs to be identified and corrected for.

Author summaryDuring analysis of pneumococcal incidence data obtained from serotype specific multiplex urine antigen testing, we identified that despite excellent test sensitivity and specificity, the small error rate in each individual serotype test has the potential to compound and cause large uncertainty in the resulting estimates of pneumococcal prevalence, obtained by combining individual results. This limits the accuracy of estimates of the burden of disease caused by vaccine preventable pneumococcal serotypes, and in certain situations can produce marked bias.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a  pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and  vaccinated and  unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19.

OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19.

InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONDiverse pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) have been linked to Alzheimers disease (AD) indicating a possibility that the culprit may be compromised immunity rather than particular microbe. If true, then vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity might be protective against AD.

METHODSWe estimated associations of common adult infections, including herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses, as well as vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risk of AD in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study.

RESULTSShingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%.

DISCUSSIONOur results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Lithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality. Methods: The UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality. Results: 591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality. Conclusions: We observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes. Methods: We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes. Findings: Colocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]). Interpretation: Our findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Given the considerable prevalence of long-term sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding pathogen-related factors that influence long-term outcomes is warranted. We aimed to compare the likelihood of long-term symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 variants, other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and non-infected individuals. Method: Data were from 5,630 individuals participating in Virus Watch, a prospective community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in England. We used logistic regression to compare the predicted probability of developing long-term symptoms (&gt;2 months duration) during different variant dominance periods according to infection status (SARS-CoV-2, other ARI, or no infection), adjusting for confounding by demographic and clinical factors and vaccination status. Results: Predicted probability of long-term sequelae was greater following SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Wild Type (adjusted predicted probability (PP) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.14-0.43), Alpha (PP= 0.28, 95% CI =0.14-0.42), Delta (PP= 0.34, 95% CI =0.25-0.43) and Omicron BA.1 periods (PP= 0.27, 95% CI =0.22-0.33) compared to later Omicron sub-variants (PP range from 0.11, 95% CI 0.08-0.15 to 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.18). While differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs (PP range 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.11 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.28) varied by period, estimates for long-term symptoms following both infection types substantially exceeded those for non-infected participants (PP range 0.01, 95% CI 0.00,0.02 to 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) across all variant periods. Conclusions: Between-variant differences influenced the likelihood of post-infection sequelae for SARS-CoV-2, with lower predicted probabilities for recent Omicron sub-variants similar to those for other contemporaneous ARIs. Both SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs were associated with long-term symptom development, and further aetiological investigation including between-pathogen comparison is recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExcess mortality has been used worldwide for summarizing the COVID-19 pandemic-related burden. In France, the reported estimates for years 2020 and 2021 vary by a factor of three, and reported evolving trends for year 2022 are discordant.

ObjectivesWe aimed at selecting the most appropriate modelling approach enabling an accurate estimation of the excess mortality in France during the 2020-2022 pandemic years.

MethodBased on the 18,646,089 deaths that occurred In France between 1990 and 2023, the natural trend of age-and gender-specific death rates over time was considered according to three models which performances were compared for accurately predicting mortality data in the absence of pandemic perturbations. The best modelling approach was then used for estimating age-and gender-specific excess deaths and corresponding expected years of life lost in the individuals deceased in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

ResultsA quadratic model trained with years 2010-2019 estimated that 49,352 [40,257; 58,165] (mean [95% confidence interval]), 43,028 [29,071; 56,381], and 54,373 [34,696; 73,187] excess deaths occurred in France in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Corresponding years of life lost rose over time with 503,289 [446,347; 561,415], 581,495 [493,911; 671,162], and 667 439 [544,196; 794,225] years of life lost for the individuals deceased in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.

ConclusionThe study proposes a reliable method for accurately estimating excess mortality. Applying this method to the 2020-2022 years of the COVID-19 pandemic in France yielded estimates of excess mortality that peaked in year 2022.</p>
