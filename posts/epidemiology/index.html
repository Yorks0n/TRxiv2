Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant. MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported. ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant). ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.\nLimited impact of lifting universal masks on SARS-COV-2 transmission in schools: The crucial role of outcome measurements\nAuthors: Li, M.; Yang, B.; Cowling, B. J.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.26.23294658\nAs the pandemics dynamics changed, many municipalities lifted face wearing requirement in school which was initially implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission within Massachusetts school districts. We first replicated previous research by Cowger et al. (2022) utilizing a Difference-in-Difference (DID) model. Then, we back project the case infection and calculate the Rt value to redo the DID analysis. However, when shifting the outcome measurement to the reproductive number (Rt), our findings suggest that lifting mask mandates can only significantly influence the Rt first two weeks post-intervention. This implies that while mask mandate plays a role in mitigation, its lifting does not drastically influence COVID-19 transmissibility in the long term.\nThe mediating role of mammographic density in the protective effect of early-life adiposity on breast cancer risk: a multivariable Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Vabistsevits, M.; Davey Smith, G.; Richardson, T. G.; Richmond, R. C.; Sieh, W.; Rothstein, J. H.; Habel, L. A.; Alexeeff, S. E.; Lloyd-Lewis, B.; Sanderson, E.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294765\nObservational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR). We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD. Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA. In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.\nA Mixed-Effects Model to Predict COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using Wastewater Surveillance\nAuthors: Daza-Torres, M. L.; Montesinos Lopez, J. C.; Desai, A. N.; Naughton, C. C.; Bischel, H. N.; Nuno, M.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23293945\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions investigated the poten- tial use of wastewater-based disease surveillance as an early warning system. Initially, methods were created to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. In- vestigators have since conducted extensive studies to examine the link between viral concentration in wastewater and COVID-19 cases in areas served by sewage treatment plants over time. However, only a few reports have attempted to create predictive models for hospitalizations at county-level based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater. This study implemented a linear mixed-effects model that observes the association between levels of virus in wastewater and county-level hospitalizations. The model was then utilized to predict short-term county-level hospitalization trends in 21 counties in California based on data from March 21, 2022, to May 21, 2023. The mod- eling framework proposed here permits repeated measurements as well as fixed and random effects. The model that assumed wastewater data as an input variable, instead of cases or test positivity rate, showed strong performance and successfully captured trends in hospitalizations. Additionally, the model allows for the prediction of SARS- CoV-2 hospitalizations two weeks ahead. Forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations could provide crucial information for hospitals to better allocate resources and prepare for potential surges in patient numbers.\nLight at night and modeled circadian disruption predict higher risk of mortality: A prospective study in \u003e88,000 participants\nAuthors: Windred, D. P.; Burns, A. C.; Lane, J. M.; Olivier, P.; Rutter, M. K.; Saxena, R.; Phillips, A. J. K.; Cain, S. W.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295231\nImportance: Light at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. Objective: To characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: UK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 57% female. Exposure: Participants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main Outcome: Cause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{+/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. Results: Risk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Minimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.\nHigh proportions of post-exertional malaise and orthostatic intolerance in people living with post-COVID-19 condition: the PRIME post-COVID study\nAuthors: Pagen, D. M.; Van Herck, M.; van Bilsen, C. J.; Brinkhues, S.; Konings, K.; den Heijer, C. D.; Spruit, M. A.; Hoebe, C. J.; Dukers-Muijrers, N. H.\nScore: 298.2, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294204\nBackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors. MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex. ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21]. Associated factors were age [\u0026le;]60 years, [\u0026ge;]1 comorbidities and living alone. ConclusionsHigh proportions of PEM and OI are observed in PL-PCC. Standard screening for PEM and OI is recommended in PL-PCC, to promote appropriate therapies.

Media-biased polyphonic epidemiology vs. evidence-based data.\nAuthors: Berna, F.; Florens, N.; Verneuil, L.; Paille, F.; Berna, C.; Nizard, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294995\nBackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an \"explosion\" in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly \"boosted\" by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports \"a dramatic uptick\" in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution. This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) \"increases\" or \"explosion\" might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009. MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic. ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an \"explosion\" in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM. ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.\nUnraveling the role of rise in temperature on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance\nAuthors: Goswami, A.; Morris, J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295147\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR), bacteria's ability to withstand antibiotics' effects, is a growing threat to global health, making it more difficult to treat infections. Temperature is a pivotal factor contributing to bacterial growth rate. Temperatures between 35 and 37{degrees}C are often the most favorable for proliferating human infections. Knowing that a rise in temperature influences bacterial growth rate, contributing to a higher infection rate, it is imperative to unravel and comprehend the association between climate change and the emergence of AMR. We hypothesized that rising temperatures could exacerbate the emergence of AMR in opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the global distribution of AMR and the correlation between AMR and socioeconomic factors, climate change, and air quality in the United States. The study found that AMR is a significant problem worldwide, with high resistance rates to common infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections in many countries. In the United States, MRSA-AMR was more common in low-income states with increased poverty rates and poor air quality. The study also found a positive correlation between the rise in temperature over the past 10 years and AMR bacterial infections. The study led to the conclusion that socioeconomic factors, climate change, and race collectively have an impact on the prevalence of AMR infections. The probability of AMR infection was highest within states with more than 1 {degrees}C rise in temperature in the last 10 years, while it was also more likely to occur in poorer states. Though the statistical details might vary depending on the data collected in future, the correlation between climate change and the emergence of AMR in bacterial infection is alarming. The study indicates that climate change has an essential, largely unrecognized influence on AMR bacterial infections that warrants additional research. It implies that comprehensive and integrated strategies are needed to address the AMR and climate change challenges.\nEstimating seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection after highly contagious Omicron outbreak: A cross sectional study in a university setting\nAuthors: Hou, C.-W.; Williams, S.; Trivino-Soto, G.; Boyle, V.; Rainford, D.; Vicino, S.; Magee, M.; Chung, Y.; Labaer, J.; Murugan, V.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.23293775\nObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among individuals aged 18 years and older DesignProspective cohort study. SettingsPopulation-based study was conducted within the Arizona State University (ASU) community. ParticipantsThe study recruited 1,397 adult participants that volunteered over a period of three days (March 1-March 3 of 2022). Primary outcome measuresSeroprevalence was conducted in the community to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies resulting from previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or vaccination. ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies was found to be 96.3% using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay and 98% using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. For anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies, the seroprevalence was 39.1% by an ELISA assay and 41.4% by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Individuals that experienced breakthrough infections exhibited the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies. Additionally, saliva samples showed promise as a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels, as they exhibited a strong correlation with the data obtained from serum samples. ConclusionAccurate estimation of population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV- 2 will monitor the trend of infection in the community and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during and after outbreaks is crucial for informing the development of effective risk mitigation protocols within the community. Protocols may include measures such as encouraging booster shots, extending mask mandates, or transitioning to online classes. Serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in communities and prompt response to future outbreaks. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe simultaneously investigated active infection and seroprevalence for the university population. C_LIO_LIOur study was strengthened by having the participants self-report data independently validated with diagnostic tests. C_LIO_LISaliva samples could be a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels. C_LIO_LIOur study was performed within the university setting therefore it only reflects the COVID-19 situation within that community. C_LIO_LIThe number of breakthrough infections and the longitudinal samples were small, thus requiring confirmation. C_LI\nA self-paced walk test for individual calibration of heart rate to energy expenditure\nAuthors: Westgate, K.; Gonzales, T. I.; Hollidge, S.; Lindsay, T.; Wareham, N.; Brage, S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294939\nIntroductionEstimating free-living physical activity (PA) with continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring is challenging due to individual variation in the relationship between HR and energy expenditure. This variation can be captured through individual calibration with graded exercise tests, but structured tests with prescribed load requires medical screening and are not always feasible in population settings. We present and evaluate an individual calibration method using HR response to a less demanding self-paced walk test. Methods643 participants from the Fenland Study (Cambridgeshire, UK) completed a 200-meter self-paced walk test, a treadmill test, and one week of continuous HR and accelerometry monitoring. Mixed effects regression was used to derive a walk test calibration model from HR response to the walk using treadmill-based parameters as criterion. Free-living PA estimates from the calibration model were compared with treadmill-calibrated as well as non-exercise calibrated estimates. ResultsThe walk calibration model captured 57% of the variance in the HR-energy expenditure relationship determined by the treadmill test. Applying the walk calibration method to data from free-living yielded similar PA estimates to those using treadmill calibration (52.7 vs 52.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; mean difference: 0.7 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1, 95% CI: -0.0, 1.5) and high correlation (r=0.89). Individual differences were observed (RMSE: 10.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; 95% limits of agreement: -20.6, 19.1 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1). Compared to using a non-exercise group calibration model (RMSE: 14.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; 95% limits of agreement: -30.4, 24.5 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1), the walk calibration improved precision by 29%. ConclusionsA 200-meter self-paced walk test captures a significant proportion of the between-individual variation in the HR-energy expenditure relationship and facilitates estimation of free-living PA in population settings.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant.

MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported.

ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant).

ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the pandemics dynamics changed, many municipalities lifted face wearing requirement in school which was initially implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID-19 transmission within Massachusetts school districts. We first replicated previous research by Cowger et al. (2022) utilizing a Difference-in-Difference (DID) model. Then, we back project the case infection and calculate the Rt value to redo the DID analysis. However, when shifting the outcome measurement to the reproductive number (Rt), our findings suggest that lifting mask mandates can only significantly influence the Rt first two weeks post-intervention. This implies that while mask mandate plays a role in mitigation, its lifting does not drastically influence COVID-19 transmissibility in the long term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Observational studies suggest that mammographic density (MD) may have a role in the unexplained protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer risk. Here, we investigated a complex and interlinked relationship between puberty onset, adiposity, MD, and their effects on breast cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR).

We estimated the effects of childhood and adulthood adiposity, and age at menarche on MD phenotypes (dense area (DA), non-dense area (NDA), percent density (PD)) using MR and multivariable MR (MVMR), allowing us to disentangle their total and direct effects. Next, we examined the effect of MD on breast cancer risk, including risk of molecular subtypes, and accounting for genetic pleiotropy. Finally, we used MVMR to evaluate whether the protective effect of childhood adiposity on breast cancer was mediated by MD.

Childhood adiposity had a strong inverse effect on mammographic DA, while adulthood adiposity increased NDA. Later menarche had an effect of increasing DA and PD, but when accounting for childhood adiposity, this effect attenuated to the null. DA and PD had a risk-increasing effect on breast cancer across all subtypes. The MD single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) estimates were extremely heterogeneous, and examination of the SNPs suggested different mechanisms may be linking MD and breast cancer. Finally, MR mediation analysis estimated that 56% (95% CIs [32% - 79%]) of the childhood adiposity effect on breast cancer risk was mediated via DA.

In this work, we sought to disentangle the relationship between factors affecting MD and breast cancer. We showed that higher childhood adiposity decreases mammographic DA, which subsequently leads to reduced breast cancer risk. Understanding this mechanism is of great importance for identifying potential targets of intervention, since advocating weight gain in childhood would not be recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions investigated the poten- tial use of wastewater-based disease surveillance as an early warning system. Initially, methods were created to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. In- vestigators have since conducted extensive studies to examine the link between viral concentration in wastewater and COVID-19 cases in areas served by sewage treatment plants over time. However, only a few reports have attempted to create predictive models for hospitalizations at county-level based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater. This study implemented a linear mixed-effects model that observes the association between levels of virus in wastewater and county-level hospitalizations. The model was then utilized to predict short-term county-level hospitalization trends in 21 counties in California based on data from March 21, 2022, to May 21, 2023. The mod- eling framework proposed here permits repeated measurements as well as fixed and random effects. The model that assumed wastewater data as an input variable, instead of cases or test positivity rate, showed strong performance and successfully captured trends in hospitalizations. Additionally, the model allows for the prediction of SARS- CoV-2 hospitalizations two weeks ahead. Forecasts of COVID-19 hospitalizations could provide crucial information for hospitals to better allocate resources and prepare for potential surges in patient numbers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Importance: Light at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. Objective: To characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: UK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{&#43;/-}7.8 years, 57% female. Exposure: Participants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main Outcome: Cause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({&#43;/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{&#43;/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. Results: Risk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and Relevance: Minimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundExercise-based treatments can be harmful in people who were SARS-CoV-2 positive and living with post-COVID-19 condition (PL-PCC) and who have post-exertional malaise (PEM) or orthostatic intolerance (OI). Nevertheless, PEM and OI are not routinely assessed by clinicians. We estimated PEM and OI proportions in PL-PCC, as well in people not living with PCC (PnL-PCC) and negatives (i.e., never reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test), and identified associated factors.

MethodsParticipants from the PRIME post-COVID study were included. PEM and OI were assessed using validated questionnaires. PCC was defined as feeling unrecovered after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable regression analyses to study PEM and OI were stratified for sex.

ResultsData from 3,783 participants was analyzed. In PL-PCC, proportion of PEM was 48.1% and 41.2%, and proportion of OI was 29.3% and 27.9% in women and in men, respectively. Proportions were higher in PL-PCC compared to negatives, for PEM in women OR=4.38 [95%CI:3.01-6.38]; in men OR=4.78 [95%CI:3.13-7.29]; for OI in women 3.06 [95%CI:1.97-4.76]; in men 2.71 [95%CI:1.75-4.21].

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an &#34;explosion&#34; in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly &#34;boosted&#34; by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports &#34;a dramatic uptick&#34; in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution.

This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) &#34;increases&#34; or &#34;explosion&#34; might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009.

MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic.

ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an &#34;explosion&#34; in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM.

ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), bacteria&#39;s ability to withstand antibiotics&#39; effects, is a growing threat to global health, making it more difficult to treat infections. Temperature is a pivotal factor contributing to bacterial growth rate. Temperatures between 35 and 37{degrees}C are often the most favorable for proliferating human infections. Knowing that a rise in temperature influences bacterial growth rate, contributing to a higher infection rate, it is imperative to unravel and comprehend the association between climate change and the emergence of AMR. We hypothesized that rising temperatures could exacerbate the emergence of AMR in opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the global distribution of AMR and the correlation between AMR and socioeconomic factors, climate change, and air quality in the United States. The study found that AMR is a significant problem worldwide, with high resistance rates to common infections such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections in many countries. In the United States, MRSA-AMR was more common in low-income states with increased poverty rates and poor air quality. The study also found a positive correlation between the rise in temperature over the past 10 years and AMR bacterial infections. The study led to the conclusion that socioeconomic factors, climate change, and race collectively have an impact on the prevalence of AMR infections. The probability of AMR infection was highest within states with more than 1 {degrees}C rise in temperature in the last 10 years, while it was also more likely to occur in poorer states. Though the statistical details might vary depending on the data collected in future, the correlation between climate change and the emergence of AMR in bacterial infection is alarming. The study indicates that climate change has an essential, largely unrecognized influence on AMR bacterial infections that warrants additional research. It implies that comprehensive and integrated strategies are needed to address the AMR and climate change challenges.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among individuals aged 18 years and older

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingsPopulation-based study was conducted within the Arizona State University (ASU) community.

ParticipantsThe study recruited 1,397 adult participants that volunteered over a period of three days (March 1-March 3 of 2022).

Primary outcome measuresSeroprevalence was conducted in the community to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies resulting from previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or vaccination.

ResultsThe seroprevalence of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies was found to be 96.3% using a semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay and 98% using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. For anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies, the seroprevalence was 39.1% by an ELISA assay and 41.4% by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Individuals that experienced breakthrough infections exhibited the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies. Additionally, saliva samples showed promise as a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels, as they exhibited a strong correlation with the data obtained from serum samples.

ConclusionAccurate estimation of population-based serosurveillance for SARS-CoV- 2 will monitor the trend of infection in the community and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during and after outbreaks is crucial for informing the development of effective risk mitigation protocols within the community. Protocols may include measures such as encouraging booster shots, extending mask mandates, or transitioning to online classes. Serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in communities and prompt response to future outbreaks.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIWe simultaneously investigated active infection and seroprevalence for the university population.
C_LIO_LIOur study was strengthened by having the participants self-report data independently validated with diagnostic tests.
C_LIO_LISaliva samples could be a potential diagnostic biofluid for measuring antibody levels.
C_LIO_LIOur study was performed within the university setting therefore it only reflects the COVID-19 situation within that community.
C_LIO_LIThe number of breakthrough infections and the longitudinal samples were small, thus requiring confirmation.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEstimating free-living physical activity (PA) with continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring is challenging due to individual variation in the relationship between HR and energy expenditure. This variation can be captured through individual calibration with graded exercise tests, but structured tests with prescribed load requires medical screening and are not always feasible in population settings. We present and evaluate an individual calibration method using HR response to a less demanding self-paced walk test.

Methods643 participants from the Fenland Study (Cambridgeshire, UK) completed a 200-meter self-paced walk test, a treadmill test, and one week of continuous HR and accelerometry monitoring. Mixed effects regression was used to derive a walk test calibration model from HR response to the walk using treadmill-based parameters as criterion. Free-living PA estimates from the calibration model were compared with treadmill-calibrated as well as non-exercise calibrated estimates.

ResultsThe walk calibration model captured 57% of the variance in the HR-energy expenditure relationship determined by the treadmill test. Applying the walk calibration method to data from free-living yielded similar PA estimates to those using treadmill calibration (52.7 vs 52.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; mean difference: 0.7 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1, 95% CI: -0.0, 1.5) and high correlation (r=0.89). Individual differences were observed (RMSE: 10.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; 95% limits of agreement: -20.6, 19.1 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1). Compared to using a non-exercise group calibration model (RMSE: 14.0 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1; 95% limits of agreement: -30.4, 24.5 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1), the walk calibration improved precision by 29%.

ConclusionsA 200-meter self-paced walk test captures a significant proportion of the between-individual variation in the HR-energy expenditure relationship and facilitates estimation of free-living PA in population settings.</p>
