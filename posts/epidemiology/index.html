A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1114.5, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nThe impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the likelihood of children identified as sources of infection in the NIH workforce: a cohort study\nAuthors: van Loben Sels, J. M.; Bailin, H. B.; Bell, M. R.; McCormick-Ell, J.; McGann, M.; Das, S.; Roder, A. E.; Ghedin, E.; Castel, A. D.; D. Rebecca, P.; Kwan, J. L.\nScore: 116.9, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23297422\nBackgroundChildren (\u003c18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce. ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (\u003c5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months. ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages. What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces. What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.\nCombining genomic data and infection estimates to characterize the complex dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States\nAuthors: Lopes, R.; Pham, K.; Klaassen, F.; Chitwood, M. H.; Hahn, A.; Redmond, S.; Swartwood, N. A.; Salomon, J. A.; Menzies, N. A.; Cohen, T.; Grubaugh, N. D.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298178\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nEvaluation of Stroke Risk Following COVID-19 mRNA Bivalent Vaccines Among U.S. Adults Aged \u003e=65 Years\nAuthors: Lu, Y.; Matuska, K.; Nadimpalli, G.; Ma, Y.; Duma, N.; Zhang, H.; Chiang, Y.; Lyu, H.; Chillarige, Y.; Forshee, R. A.; Anderson, S. A.\nScore: 1136.9, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nDevice-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity and major cardiovascular events\nAuthors: Stamatakis, E.; Ahmadi, M. N.; Biswas, R. K.; del Pozo Cruz, B.; Thogersen-Ntoumani, C.; Murphy, M.; Sabag, A.; Lear, S.; Gill, J. M.; Chow, C. K.; Hamer, M.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297430\nImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults. ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study. ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes. Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke). ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups. Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.\nOperationalized releases of wAlbB Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti lead to sharp decreases in dengue incidence dependent on Wolbachia frequency\nAuthors: Hoffmann, A.

P.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298240\nIn Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a 'replacement' strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.\nInfluenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Lee, Y.-C.; Liu, L.; Yuan, L.; Risk, M.; Heinrich, K.; Witteveen-Lane, M.; Hayek, S.; Malosh, R.; Pop-Busui, R.; Jiang, B.; Shen, C.; Chesla, D.; Kennedy, R.; Shi, X.; Sims, M.; Homayouni, R.; Zhao, L.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297682\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p\u003c0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p\u003c0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p \u003c0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p \u003c0.001). ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.\n3-Generation Family Medical Histories of Mental, Neurologic, Cardiometabolic, Birth Defect, Asthma, Allergy, and Autoimmune Conditions Associated with Autism\nAuthors: Schendel, D.; Ejlskov, L.; Overgaard, M.; Jinwala, Z.; Kim, V.; Parner, E.; Kalkbrenner, A.; Ladd-Acosta, C.; Fallin, M. D.; Xie, S.; Mortensen, P. B.; Lee, B.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298042\nBackgroundFamily histories of different mental and non-mental conditions have often been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the restricted scope of conditions and family members that have been investigated limits etiologic understanding. We aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of ASD associations with 3-generation family histories of 90 mental, neurologic, cardiometabolic, birth defect, asthma, allergy, and autoimmune conditions. The assessment comprised separate estimates of association with ASD overall; separate estimates by sex and intellectual disability (ID) status; as well as separate estimates of the co-occurrence of each of the 90 disorders in autistic persons. Additionally, we aimed to provide interactive catalogues of results to facilitate results visualization and further hypothesis-generation. MethodsWe conducted a population-based, registry cohort study comprised of all live births in Denmark, 1980-2012, of Denmark-born parents, and with birth registry information (1,697,231 births), and their 3-generation family member types (20 types). All cohort members were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for an ASD diagnosis. All participants (cohort members and each family member) were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for each of 90 diagnoses, emigration or death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for ASD overall; by sex; or accounting for ID via separate Cox regression models for each diagnosis-family member type combination, adjusting for birth year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, parental ages at birth, and number of family member types of index person. aHRs were also calculated for sex-specific co-occurrence of each disorder, for ASD overall and considering ID. A catalogue of all results is displayed via interactive heat maps here: https://ncrr-au.shinyapps.io/asd-riskatlas/ and interactive graphic summaries of results are here: https://public.tableau.com/views/ASDPlots_16918786403110/e-Figure5. ResultsIncreased aHRs for ASD (26,840 cases; 1.6% of births) were observed for almost all individual mental disorder-family member type combinations yet for fewer non-mental disorder-family member type combinations. aHRs declined with diminishing degree of relatedness between the index person and family member for some disorders, especially mental disorders. Variation in aHR magnitude by family member sex (e.g., higher maternal than paternal aHRs) or side of the family (e.g., higher maternal versus paternal half sibling aHRs) was more evident among non-mental than mental disorders. Co-occurring ID in the family member or the index person impacted aHR variation. ConclusionOur approach revealed considerable breadth and variation in magnitude of familial health history associations with ASD by type of condition, sex of the affected family member, side of the family, sex of the index person, and ID status which is indicative of diverse genetic, familial, and non-genetic ASD etiologic pathways. More careful attention to identifying sources of autism likelihood encompassed in family medical history, in addition to genetics, may accelerate understanding of factors underlying neurodiversity.\nA data-adaptive method for investigating effect heterogeneity with high-dimensional covariates in Mendelian randomization\nAuthors: Tian, H.; Tom, B. D. M.; Burgess, S.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.23297706\nMendelian randomization is a popular method for causal inference with observational data that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables. Similarly to a randomized trial, a standard Mendelian randomization analysis estimates the population-averaged effect of an exposure on an outcome. Dividing the population into subgroups can reveal effect heterogeneity to inform who would most benefit from intervention on the exposure. However, as covariates are measured post-\"randomization\", naive stratification typically induces collider bias in stratum-specific estimates. We extend a previously proposed stratification method (the \"doubly-ranked method\") to form strata based on a single covariate, and introduce a data-adaptive random forest method to calculate stratum-specific estimates that are robust to collider bias based on a high-dimensional covariate set. We also propose measures to assess heterogeneity between stratum-specific estimates (to understand whether estimates are more variable than expected due to chance alone) and variable importance (to identify the key drivers of effect heterogeneity). We show that the effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung function is heterogeneous, depending most strongly on hip circumference and weight. While for most individuals, the predicted effect of increasing BMI on lung function is negative, it is positive for some individuals and strongly negative for others.\nMeasures of population immunity can predict the dominant clade of influenza A (H3N2) and reveal age-associated differences in susceptibility and specificity\nAuthors: Kim, K.; Gouma, S.; Vieira, M. C.; Weirick, M. E.; Hensley, S. E.; Cobey, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297569\nFor antigenically variable pathogens such as influenza, strain fitness is partly determined by the relative availability of hosts susceptible to infection with that strain compared to others. Antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) confer substantial protection against influenza infection. We asked if a cross-sectional antibody-derived estimate of population susceptibility to different clades of influenza A (H3N2) could predict the success of clades in the following season. We collected sera from 483 healthy individuals aged 1 to 90 years in the summer of 2017 and analyzed neutralizing responses to the HA and NA of representative strains. The clade to which neutralizing antibody titers were lowest, indicating greater population susceptibility, dominated the next season. Titers to different HA and NA clades varied dramatically between individuals but showed significant associations with age, suggesting dependence on correlated past exposures. Despite this correlation, inter-individual variability in antibody titers to H3N2 strains increased gradually with age. This study indicates how representative measures of population immunity might improve evolutionary forecasts and inform selective pressures on influenza. Author summaryThe rapid evolution of influenza requires semi-annual updates to the strains included in influenza vaccines. New vaccine strains are frequently chosen based on their ability to escape immunity to other strains, with the degree of escape estimated from experimental infections of ferrets. However, the cross-reactivity derived from ferret experiments does not always match measures in people, who often have a long history of influenza exposures. We conducted a large cross-sectional serological study involving 483 individuals between 1 and 90 years of age and tested their sera against the major surface protein of eight circulating influenza strains. Levels of neutralizing antibody successfully predicted the dominant strain in the next influenza season. Different age groups showed different patterns of binding, although there was substantial variability in responses within age groups and an increase in the diversity of neutralizing antibody profiles with age. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using cross-sectional sera to estimate major selection pressure on influenza.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChildren (&lt;18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce.

ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (&lt;5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months.

ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages.

What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces.

What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults.

ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study.

ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes.

Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).

ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a &#39;replacement&#39; strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022).

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p&lt;0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p&lt;0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p &lt;0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p &lt;0.001).

ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFamily histories of different mental and non-mental conditions have often been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the restricted scope of conditions and family members that have been investigated limits etiologic understanding. We aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of ASD associations with 3-generation family histories of 90 mental, neurologic, cardiometabolic, birth defect, asthma, allergy, and autoimmune conditions. The assessment comprised separate estimates of association with ASD overall; separate estimates by sex and intellectual disability (ID) status; as well as separate estimates of the co-occurrence of each of the 90 disorders in autistic persons. Additionally, we aimed to provide interactive catalogues of results to facilitate results visualization and further hypothesis-generation.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based, registry cohort study comprised of all live births in Denmark, 1980-2012, of Denmark-born parents, and with birth registry information (1,697,231 births), and their 3-generation family member types (20 types). All cohort members were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for an ASD diagnosis. All participants (cohort members and each family member) were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for each of 90 diagnoses, emigration or death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for ASD overall; by sex; or accounting for ID via separate Cox regression models for each diagnosis-family member type combination, adjusting for birth year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, parental ages at birth, and number of family member types of index person. aHRs were also calculated for sex-specific co-occurrence of each disorder, for ASD overall and considering ID. A catalogue of all results is displayed via interactive heat maps here: https://ncrr-au.shinyapps.io/asd-riskatlas/ and interactive graphic summaries of results are here: https://public.tableau.com/views/ASDPlots_16918786403110/e-Figure5.

ResultsIncreased aHRs for ASD (26,840 cases; 1.6% of births) were observed for almost all individual mental disorder-family member type combinations yet for fewer non-mental disorder-family member type combinations. aHRs declined with diminishing degree of relatedness between the index person and family member for some disorders, especially mental disorders. Variation in aHR magnitude by family member sex (e.g., higher maternal than paternal aHRs) or side of the family (e.g., higher maternal versus paternal half sibling aHRs) was more evident among non-mental than mental disorders. Co-occurring ID in the family member or the index person impacted aHR variation.

ConclusionOur approach revealed considerable breadth and variation in magnitude of familial health history associations with ASD by type of condition, sex of the affected family member, side of the family, sex of the index person, and ID status which is indicative of diverse genetic, familial, and non-genetic ASD etiologic pathways. More careful attention to identifying sources of autism likelihood encompassed in family medical history, in addition to genetics, may accelerate understanding of factors underlying neurodiversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mendelian randomization is a popular method for causal inference with observational data that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables. Similarly to a randomized trial, a standard Mendelian randomization analysis estimates the population-averaged effect of an exposure on an outcome. Dividing the population into subgroups can reveal effect heterogeneity to inform who would most benefit from intervention on the exposure. However, as covariates are measured post-&#34;randomization&#34;, naive stratification typically induces collider bias in stratum-specific estimates. We extend a previously proposed stratification method (the &#34;doubly-ranked method&#34;) to form strata based on a single covariate, and introduce a data-adaptive random forest method to calculate stratum-specific estimates that are robust to collider bias based on a high-dimensional covariate set. We also propose measures to assess heterogeneity between stratum-specific estimates (to understand whether estimates are more variable than expected due to chance alone) and variable importance (to identify the key drivers of effect heterogeneity). We show that the effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung function is heterogeneous, depending most strongly on hip circumference and weight. While for most individuals, the predicted effect of increasing BMI on lung function is negative, it is positive for some individuals and strongly negative for others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For antigenically variable pathogens such as influenza, strain fitness is partly determined by the relative availability of hosts susceptible to infection with that strain compared to others. Antibodies to the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) confer substantial protection against influenza infection. We asked if a cross-sectional antibody-derived estimate of population susceptibility to different clades of influenza A (H3N2) could predict the success of clades in the following season. We collected sera from 483 healthy individuals aged 1 to 90 years in the summer of 2017 and analyzed neutralizing responses to the HA and NA of representative strains. The clade to which neutralizing antibody titers were lowest, indicating greater population susceptibility, dominated the next season. Titers to different HA and NA clades varied dramatically between individuals but showed significant associations with age, suggesting dependence on correlated past exposures. Despite this correlation, inter-individual variability in antibody titers to H3N2 strains increased gradually with age. This study indicates how representative measures of population immunity might improve evolutionary forecasts and inform selective pressures on influenza.

Author summaryThe rapid evolution of influenza requires semi-annual updates to the strains included in influenza vaccines. New vaccine strains are frequently chosen based on their ability to escape immunity to other strains, with the degree of escape estimated from experimental infections of ferrets. However, the cross-reactivity derived from ferret experiments does not always match measures in people, who often have a long history of influenza exposures. We conducted a large cross-sectional serological study involving 483 individuals between 1 and 90 years of age and tested their sera against the major surface protein of eight circulating influenza strains. Levels of neutralizing antibody successfully predicted the dominant strain in the next influenza season. Different age groups showed different patterns of binding, although there was substantial variability in responses within age groups and an increase in the diversity of neutralizing antibody profiles with age. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using cross-sectional sera to estimate major selection pressure on influenza.</p>
