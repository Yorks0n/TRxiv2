A.\nScore: 1127.8, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nEffects of childhood and adult height on later life cardiovascular disease risk estimated through Mendelian randomization\nAuthors: Richardson, T. G.; Urquijo, H.; Howe, L. J.; Hawkes, G.; Frayling, T. M.; Davey Smith, G.\nScore: 39.2, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296922\nBackgroundTaller individuals are at elevated and protected risk of various cardiovascular disease endpoints. Whether this is due to a direct consequence of their height during childhood, a long-term effect of remaining tall throughout the lifecourse, or confounding by other factors, is unknown. MethodsWe sought to address this by harnessing human genetic data to separate the independent effects of childhood and adulthood height using an approach known as lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR). We analysed 5 cardiovascular disease endpoints (coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)) using findings from large-scale genome-wide consortia (n=184,305 to 1,030,836). ResultsProtective effects of taller childhood height on risk of later life CAD (OR=0.78 per change in height category, 95% CI=0.70 to 0.86, P=4x10 -10) and stroke (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.86 to 1.00, P=0.03) were found using a univariable model, although evidence of these effects attenuated in a multivariable setting upon accounting for adulthood height. In contrast, direct effects of taller childhood height on increased risk of later life AF (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.42 to 1.79, P=5x10 -7) and TAA (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.95, P=0.03) were found even after accounting for adulthood height in the multivariable model. ConclusionsThe protective effect of childhood height on risk of CAD and stroke is largely attributed to the causal pathway involving adulthood height, w hich may therefore be explained by taller children typically becoming taller individuals in later life. Conversely, the independent effect of childhood height on increased risk of AF and TAA may point towards developmental mechanisms in early life which confer a lifelong risk on these disease outcomes.\nAssociation between common adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands\nAuthors: Holwerda, M. R.; Hoeve, C. E.; Huiberts, A. J.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.; van den Hof, S.; Knol, M.\nScore: 171.3, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297194\nINTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations. METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination. RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (\u003c60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54). CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.\nA methylome-wide association study of major depression with out-of-sample case-control classification and trans-ancestry comparison\nAuthors: Shen, X.; Barbu, M.; Caramaschi, D.; Arathimos, R.; Czamara, D.; David, F.; Dearman, A.; Dilkes, E.; Herrera Rivero, M.; Huider, F.; Kühn, L.; Lu, K.-C.; Palviainen, T.; Schowe, A.

J.; Gadd, D. A.; Greimel, E.; Hannon, E.; Harris, S.; Homuth, G.; Howard, D.; Iurato, S.; Korhonen, T.; Lu, T.-P.; Martin, N.; Martins, J.; McDermott, E.; Meinert, S.; Navarro, P.; Ollikainen, M.; Pehl, V.; Piechaczek, C.; Scher\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297630\nMajor Depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p \u003c 6.42x10-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis ({beta} = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta ({beta}=-0.154, p=1.5x10-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Walds ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7x10-3 to 4.58x10-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.\nInfluenza vaccine effectiveness against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Lee, Y.-C.; Liu, L.; Yuan, L.; Risk, M.; Heinrich, K.; Witteveen-Lane, M.; Hayek, S.; Malosh, R.; Pop-Busui, R.; Jiang, B.; Shen, C.; Chesla, D.; Kennedy, R.; Shi, X.; Sims, M.; Homayouni, R.; Zhao, L.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297682\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022). MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p\u003c0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p\u003c0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p \u003c0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p \u003c0.001). ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.\nBody mass index and all-cause mortality in HUNT and UK Biobank studies: revised non-linear Mendelian randomization analyses\nAuthors: Burgess, S.; Sun, Y.-Q.; Zhou, A.; Buck, C.; Mason, A. M.; Mai, X.-M.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297612\nObjectivesTo estimate the shape of the causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality risk in a Mendelian randomization framework. DesignMendelian randomization analyses of two prospective population-based cohorts. SettingIndividuals of European ancestries living in Norway or the United Kingdom. Participants56,150 participants from the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway and 366,385 participants from UK Biobank recruited by postal invitation. OutcomesAll-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, non-cardiovascular non-cancer). ResultsA previously published non-linear Mendelian randomization analysis of these data using the residual stratification method suggested a J-shaped association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality outcomes with the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of around 25 kg/m2. However, the \"constant genetic effect\" assumption required by this method is violated. The re-analysis of these data using the more reliable doubly-ranked stratification method still indicated a J-shaped relationship, but with less precision in estimates at the lower end of the BMI distribution. Evidence for a harmful effect of reducing BMI at low BMI levels was only present in some analyses, and where present, only below 20 kg/m2. A harmful effect of increasing BMI for all-cause mortality was evident above 25 kg/m2, for cardiovascular mortality above 24 kg/m2, for non-cardiovascular non-cancer mortality above 26 kg/m2, and for cancer mortality above 30 kg/m2. In UK Biobank, the association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality at high BMI levels was stronger in women than in men. ConclusionThis research challenges findings from previous conventional observational epidemiology and Mendelian randomization investigations that the lowest level of mortality risk is at a BMI level of around 25 kg/m2. Our results provide evidence that reductions in BMI will only increase mortality risk for a small proportion of the population, and increases in BMI will increase mortality risk for those with BMI above 25 kg/m2. Strengths and limitations of the studyO_LIMendelian randomization design minimizes bias due to confounding and reverse causation C_LIO_LILarge sample sizes enable powerful analyses even in low BMI individuals C_LIO_LIValidity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables cannot be verified C_LIO_LIBias due to selection could be non-negligible and could vary across strata C_LIO_LIAll estimates are averaged across a stratum of the population; individual effects of raising or lowering BMI may vary between individuals C_LI\nWastewater Tiling Amplicon Sequencing Reveals Longitudinal Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Prevalence in the Community\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Ni, G.; Tian, W.; Wang, H.; Li, J.; Thai, P.; Choi, P. M.; Jackson, G.; Hu, S.; Yang, B.; Guo, J.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297759\nSARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, while the decline in clinical sequencing efforts hampers public health sectors to prepare for the menace of ongoing variant emergence and future COVID-19 surges.1 Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed to provide complementary insights on the variants being transmitted in communities.2 However, limited research has been dedicated to the use sequencing methods for tracking disease prevalence and variant dynamics in wastewater, particularly on a large scale. Here, we employed a tiling amplicon sequencing to track the dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from Queensland, Australia from 2020 to 2022. RNA concentrations in wastewater measured by ATOPlex showed a stronger correlation and greater consistency with the number of daily new cases than a PCR-based method. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater were largely in line with clinical reports. These findings support that WBE and sensitive sequencing methods can serve as a long-term approach for disease surveillance, thus aiding in disease outbreak prevention, control, and management.\nUnderstanding COVID-19 testing behaviour in England through a sociodemographic lens\nAuthors: Bajaj, S.; Chen, S.; Creswell, R.; Naidoo, R.; L.-H. Tsui, J.; Kolade, O.; Nicholson, G.; Lehmann, B.; A. Hay, J.; U.G. Kraemer, M.; Aguas, R.; A. Donnelly, C.; Fowler, T.; Hopkins, S.; Cantrell, L.; Dahal, P.; J. White, L.; Stepniewska, K.; Voysey, M.; Lambert, B.; EY-Oxford Health Analytics Consortium, Score: 6.2, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297608\nBackgroundUnderstanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour can help to protect the vulnerable and guide equity-driven interventions. Using COVID-19 testing data for England and data from community prevalence surveillance surveys (REACT-1 and ONS-CIS) from October 2020 to March 2022, we investigated the relationship between sociodemographic factors and testing behaviours in England. MethodsWe used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for 290 million tests performed and reported) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (data for 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public, provided by date, self-reported age and ethnicity at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. Using confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability by PCR by sociodemographic groups. We also estimated the daily incidence allowing us to determine the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme. FindingsFrom March 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per-capita than those in the least deprived areas (Median ratio [Inter quartile range, IQR]: 0{middle dot}50 [0{middle dot}44, 0{middle dot}54]). During October 2020 - June 2021, PCR testing patterns were in the opposite direction (Median ratio [IQR]: 1{middle dot}8 [1{middle dot}7, 1{middle dot}9]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British communities were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the Alpha and Omicron BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England COVID-19 testing program detected 26% - 40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups. PCR testing biases were generally higher than for LFDs, which was in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. During the invasion phases of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern, the PCR testing bias in the most deprived populations was roughly double (ratio: 2{middle dot}2 and 2{middle dot}7 respectively) that in the least. We also determined that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that there was possibly a longer delay in reporting a positive LFD test in the Black populations. InterpretationDifferences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups may be reflective of the relatively higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, digital literacy, and differing perception about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. Our work shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions at fine scale levels and by sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics.

We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations. MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects. ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data. ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.\nAn efficient approach to nowcasting the time-varying reproduction number\nAuthors: Sumalinab, B.; Gressani, O.; Hens, N.; Faes, C.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297251\nEstimating the instantaneous reproduction number ([R]t) in near real-time is crucial for monitoring and responding to epidemic outbreaks on a daily basis. However, such estimates often suffer from bias due to reporting delays inherent in surveillance systems. A fast and flexible Bayesian methodology is proposed to overcome this challenge by estimating[R] t while taking into account reporting delays. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the nowcasting of cases is naturally taken into account to get a valid uncertainty estimation of the nowcasted reproduction number. The proposed methodology is evaluated through a simulation study and applied to COVID-19 incidence data in Belgium.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTaller individuals are at elevated and protected risk of various cardiovascular disease endpoints. Whether this is due to a direct consequence of their height during childhood, a long-term effect of remaining tall throughout the lifecourse, or confounding by other factors, is unknown.

MethodsWe sought to address this by harnessing human genetic data to separate the independent effects of childhood and adulthood height using an approach known as lifecourse Mendelian randomization (MR). We analysed 5 cardiovascular disease endpoints (coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA)) using findings from large-scale genome-wide consortia (n=184,305 to 1,030,836).

ResultsProtective effects of taller childhood height on risk of later life CAD (OR=0.78 per change in height category, 95% CI=0.70 to 0.86, P=4x10 -10) and stroke (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.86 to 1.00, P=0.03) were found using a univariable model, although evidence of these effects attenuated in a multivariable setting upon accounting for adulthood height. In contrast, direct effects of taller childhood height on increased risk of later life AF (OR=1.61, 95% CI=1.42 to 1.79, P=5x10 -7) and TAA (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.95, P=0.03) were found even after accounting for adulthood height in the multivariable model.

ConclusionsThe protective effect of childhood height on risk of CAD and stroke is largely attributed to the causal pathway involving adulthood height, w hich may therefore be explained by taller children typically becoming taller individuals in later life. Conversely, the independent effect of childhood height on increased risk of AF and TAA may point towards developmental mechanisms in early life which confer a lifelong risk on these disease outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations.

METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination.

RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (&lt;60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54).

CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Major Depression (MD) is a leading cause of global disease burden, and both experimental and population-based studies suggest that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be associated with the condition. However, previous DNAm studies have not so far been widely replicated, suggesting a need for larger meta-analysis studies. In the present study, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Major Depressive Disorder working group conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis (MWAS) for life-time MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1846 controls). We identified fifteen CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance (p &lt; 6.42x10-8). Top CpG effect sizes in European ancestries were positively correlated with those from an independent East Asian MWAS (r = 0.482 and p = 0.068 for significant CpG sites, r = 0.261 and p = 0.009 for the top 100 CpG sites). Methylation score (MS) created using the MWAS summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis ({beta} = 0.122, p = 0.005, AUC = 0.53). MS was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with Tumor Necrosis Factor Beta ({beta}=-0.154, p=1.5x10-5). Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis demonstrated that 23 CpG sites were potentially causally associated with MD and six of those were replicated in an independent mQTL dataset (Walds ratio test, absolute {beta} ranged from 0.056 to 0.932, p ranged from 7x10-3 to 4.58x10-6). CpG sites located in the Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) region showed the strongest evidence from MR analysis of being associated with MD. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system. Larger sample sizes in diverse ancestries are likely to reveal replicable associations to improve mechanistic inferences with the potential to inform molecular target identification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSSome studies conducted before the Delta and Omicron variant-dominant periods have indicated that influenza vaccination provided protection against COVID-19 infection or hospitalization, but these results were limited by small study cohorts and a lack of comprehensive data on patient characteristics. No studies have examined this question during the Delta and Omicron periods (08/01/2021 to 2/22/2022).

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of influenza-vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Corewell Health East(CHE, formerly known as Beaumont Health), Corewell Health West(CHW, formerly known as Spectrum Health) and Michigan Medicine (MM) healthcare system during the Delta-dominant and Omicron-dominant periods. We used a test-negative, case-control analysis to assess the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 outcome in adults, while controlling for individual characteristics as well as pandameic severity and waning immunity of COVID-19 vaccine.

ResultsThe influenza vaccination has shown to provided some protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized outcome across three main healthcare systems. CHE site (odds ratio [OR]=0.73, vaccine effectiveness [VE]=27%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [18-35], p&lt;0.001), CHW site (OR=0.85, VE=15%, 95% CI: [6-24], p&lt;0.001), MM (OR=0.50, VE=50%, 95% CI: [40-58], p &lt;0.001) and overall (OR=0.75, VE=25%, 95% CI: [20-30], p &lt;0.001).

ConclusionThe influenza vaccine provides a small degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection across our study sites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo estimate the shape of the causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality risk in a Mendelian randomization framework.

DesignMendelian randomization analyses of two prospective population-based cohorts.

SettingIndividuals of European ancestries living in Norway or the United Kingdom.

Participants56,150 participants from the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) in Norway and 366,385 participants from UK Biobank recruited by postal invitation.

OutcomesAll-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, non-cardiovascular non-cancer).

ResultsA previously published non-linear Mendelian randomization analysis of these data using the residual stratification method suggested a J-shaped association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality outcomes with the lowest mortality risk at a BMI of around 25 kg/m2. However, the &#34;constant genetic effect&#34; assumption required by this method is violated. The re-analysis of these data using the more reliable doubly-ranked stratification method still indicated a J-shaped relationship, but with less precision in estimates at the lower end of the BMI distribution. Evidence for a harmful effect of reducing BMI at low BMI levels was only present in some analyses, and where present, only below 20 kg/m2. A harmful effect of increasing BMI for all-cause mortality was evident above 25 kg/m2, for cardiovascular mortality above 24 kg/m2, for non-cardiovascular non-cancer mortality above 26 kg/m2, and for cancer mortality above 30 kg/m2. In UK Biobank, the association between genetically-predicted BMI and mortality at high BMI levels was stronger in women than in men.

ConclusionThis research challenges findings from previous conventional observational epidemiology and Mendelian randomization investigations that the lowest level of mortality risk is at a BMI level of around 25 kg/m2. Our results provide evidence that reductions in BMI will only increase mortality risk for a small proportion of the population, and increases in BMI will increase mortality risk for those with BMI above 25 kg/m2.

Strengths and limitations of the studyO_LIMendelian randomization design minimizes bias due to confounding and reverse causation
C_LIO_LILarge sample sizes enable powerful analyses even in low BMI individuals
C_LIO_LIValidity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables cannot be verified
C_LIO_LIBias due to selection could be non-negligible and could vary across strata
C_LIO_LIAll estimates are averaged across a stratum of the population; individual effects of raising or lowering BMI may vary between individuals

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, while the decline in clinical sequencing efforts hampers public health sectors to prepare for the menace of ongoing variant emergence and future COVID-19 surges.1 Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed to provide complementary insights on the variants being transmitted in communities.2 However, limited research has been dedicated to the use sequencing methods for tracking disease prevalence and variant dynamics in wastewater, particularly on a large scale. Here, we employed a tiling amplicon sequencing to track the dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from Queensland, Australia from 2020 to 2022. RNA concentrations in wastewater measured by ATOPlex showed a stronger correlation and greater consistency with the number of daily new cases than a PCR-based method. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater were largely in line with clinical reports. These findings support that WBE and sensitive sequencing methods can serve as a long-term approach for disease surveillance, thus aiding in disease outbreak prevention, control, and management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUnderstanding underlying mechanisms of heterogeneity in test-seeking and reporting behaviour can help to protect the vulnerable and guide equity-driven interventions. Using COVID-19 testing data for England and data from community prevalence surveillance surveys (REACT-1 and ONS-CIS) from October 2020 to March 2022, we investigated the relationship between sociodemographic factors and testing behaviours in England.

MethodsWe used mass testing data for lateral flow device (LFD; data for 290 million tests performed and reported) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (data for 107 million tests performed and returned from the laboratory) tests made available for the general public, provided by date, self-reported age and ethnicity at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. Using a mechanistic causal model to debias the PCR testing data, we obtained estimates of weekly SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by self-reported ethnic groups and age groups for LTLAs in England. This approach to debiasing the PCR (or LFD) testing data also estimated a testing bias parameter defined as the odds of testing in infected versus not infected individuals, which would be close to zero if the likelihood of test seeking (or seeking and reporting) was the same regardless of infection status. Using confirmatory PCR data, we estimated false positivity rates, sensitivity, specificity, and the rate of decline in detection probability by PCR by sociodemographic groups. We also estimated the daily incidence allowing us to determine the fraction of cases captured by the testing programme.

FindingsFrom March 2021 onwards, individuals in the most deprived regions reported approximately half as many LFD tests per-capita than those in the least deprived areas (Median ratio [Inter quartile range, IQR]: 0{middle dot}50 [0{middle dot}44, 0{middle dot}54]). During October 2020 - June 2021, PCR testing patterns were in the opposite direction (Median ratio [IQR]: 1{middle dot}8 [1{middle dot}7, 1{middle dot}9]). Infection prevalences in Asian or Asian British communities were considerably higher than those of other ethnic groups during the Alpha and Omicron BA.1 waves. Our estimates indicate that the England COVID-19 testing program detected 26% - 40% of all cases (including asymptomatic cases) over the study period with no consistent differences by deprivation levels or ethnic groups.

PCR testing biases were generally higher than for LFDs, which was in line with the general policy of symptomatic and asymptomatic use of these tests. During the invasion phases of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern, the PCR testing bias in the most deprived populations was roughly double (ratio: 2{middle dot}2 and 2{middle dot}7 respectively) that in the least. We also determined that ethnic minorities and older individuals were less likely to use confirmatory PCR tests through most of the pandemic and that there was possibly a longer delay in reporting a positive LFD test in the Black populations.

InterpretationDifferences in testing behaviours across sociodemographic groups may be reflective of the relatively higher costs of self-isolation to vulnerable populations, differences in test accessibility, digital literacy, and differing perception about the utility of tests and risks posed by infection. Our work shows how mass testing data can be used in conjunction with surveillance surveys to identify gaps in the uptake of public health interventions at fine scale levels and by sociodemographic groups. It provides a framework for monitoring local interventions and yields valuable lessons for policy makers in ensuring an equitable response to future pandemics.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations.

MethodsConcentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects.

ResultsSingle pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1{micro}g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data.

ConclusionLong term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Estimating the instantaneous reproduction number ([R]t) in near real-time is crucial for monitoring and responding to epidemic outbreaks on a daily basis. However, such estimates often suffer from bias due to reporting delays inherent in surveillance systems. A fast and flexible Bayesian methodology is proposed to overcome this challenge by estimating[R] t while taking into account reporting delays. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with the nowcasting of cases is naturally taken into account to get a valid uncertainty estimation of the nowcasted reproduction number. The proposed methodology is evaluated through a simulation study and applied to COVID-19 incidence data in Belgium.</p>
