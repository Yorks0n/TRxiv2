Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023. MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths. FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [\u0026ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [\u0026ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [\u0026ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period. InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures. FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest. Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [\u0026ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [\u0026ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [\u0026ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967). Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.\nBNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted Vaccine and COVID-19 Hospital Admissions and Ambulatory Visits in US Adults\nAuthors: Tartof, S. Y.; Slezak, J. M.; Frankland, T. B.; Puzniak, L.; Hong, V.; Ackerson, B. K.; Stern, J. A.; Simmons, S.; Jodar, L.; McLaughlin, J. M.\nScore: 2257.8, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300512\nImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited. ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits. ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. KEY POINTS QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated? FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.\nRisk factors for experiencing Long-COVID symptoms: Insights from two nationally representative surveys\nAuthors: Wu, Y.; Sawano, M.; Wu, Y.; Shah, R.; Bishop, P.; Iwasaki, A.; Krumholz, H.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301170\nBackgroundLong COVID (LC) is a complex and multisystemic condition marked by a diverse range of symptoms, yet its associated risk factors remain poorly defined. MethodsLeveraging data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), both representative of the United States population, this study aimed to identify demographic characteristics associated with LC. The sample was restricted to individuals aged 18 years and older who reported a positive COVID-19 test or doctors diagnosis. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing characteristics between participants with and without LC. Furthermore, we developed multivariate logistic regression models on demographic covariates that would have been valid at the time of the COVID-19 infection. ResultsAmong the 124,313 individuals in BRFSS and 10,131 in the NHIS reporting either a positive test or doctors diagnosis for COVID-19 (Table), 26,783 (21.5%) in BRFSS and 1,797 (17.1%) in NHIS reported LC. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we found middle age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of a college degree, and residence in non-metropolitan areas associated with higher risk of LC. Notably, the initial severity of acute COVID-19 was strongly associated with LC risk. In contrast, significantly lower ORs were reported for Non-Hispanic Asian and Black Americans compared to Non-Hispanic White. ConclusionsIn the United States, there is marked variation in the risk of LC by demographic factors and initial infection severity. Further research is needed to understand the underlying cause of these observations.\nLong COVID Disability Burden in US Adults: YLDs and NIH Funding Relative to Other Conditions\nAuthors: Bonuck, K.; Gao, Q.; Congdon, S.; Kim, R.\nScore: 124.1, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301057\nBackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex. MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions. FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (\u003c1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition. InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden. Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords \"years lived with disability\" + \"COVID\" yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced \"disability-adjusted life years\" (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, \"disease burden\" + Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact. We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions. Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at \u003c1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was \u003e= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions. Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.\nImpact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 on total and cause-specific maternal mortality: A natural experiment in Chile during the peak of the outbreak SARS-CoV-2 Impact on Maternal Mortality: Chiles Outbreak Study\nAuthors: Enriquez, Y.; Critto, M. E.; Weinberg, R.; de Janon Quevedo, L.; Galleguillos, A.; Koch, E.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301426\nBackgroundThis study estimated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on maternal death causes in Chile during the outbreak peak between 2020 and 2021. Materials and MethodsA natural experiment was conducted using official data on maternal deaths and live births (LBs) between 1997 and 2021. Trend changes in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were assessed using segmented regression. The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected rates on MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). FindingsITS analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak impacted the MMR due to indirect causes, with a greater increase in indirect nonrespiratory causes than respiratory causes. The ARIMA forecast was consistent with ITS, showing that the expected MMR for indirect causes was substantially lower than the observed rates (9.65 in 2020 and 7.46/100,000 LBs in 2021). The expected MMR was 3.44 in 2020 and 1.55 in 2021. For nonrespiratory causes, the observed values of the MMR for 2020 (8.77/100.000 LBs) and 2021 (7.46/100.000 LBs) doubled the prediction 4.02 (95% CI: 0.44-7.61) and 3.83 (95% CI: -0.12-7.79). No significant effect was found on direct obstetrical deaths. InterpretationDuring 2020-2021, there was a rise in the MMR in Chile attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic contributed to an escalation in the MMR due to indirect causes, particularly nonrespiratory and infectious causes, suggesting that the risk of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 was increased from previous comorbidities.\nEstimating epidemiological delay distributions for infectious diseases\nAuthors: Park, S. W.; Akhmetzhanov, A. R.; Charniga, K.; Cori, A.; Davies, N. G.; Dushoff, J.; Funk, S.; Gostic, K.; Grenfell, B.; Linton, N.; Lipsitch, M.; Lison, A.; Overton, C. E.; Ward, T.; Abbott, S.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301247\nUnderstanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates directly influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. In this study, we explore challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases. Despite their importance, these issues are frequently overlooked in the current literature, often resulting in biased conclusions. This study aims to shed light on these challenges, providing valuable insights for epidemiologists and infectious disease modellers. Our work motivates comprehensive approaches for accounting for these issues based on the underlying theoretical concepts. We also discuss simpler methods that are widely used, which do not fully account for known biases. We evaluate the statistical performance of these methods using simulated exponential growth and epidemic scenarios informed by data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic. Our findings highlight that using simpler methods can lead to biased estimates of vital epidemiological parameters. An approximate-latent-variable method emerges as the best overall performer, while an efficient, widely implemented interval-reduced-censoring-and-truncation method was only slightly worse. Other methods, such as a joint-primary-incidence-and-delay method and a dynamic-correction method, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, although they have inherent limitations and may not be the best choice for more complex problems. Despite presenting a range of methods that performed well in the contexts we evaluated, residual biases persisted, predominantly due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the censoring interval follows a uniform distribution; instead, this distribution should depend on epidemic dynamics. However, in realistic scenarios with daily censoring, these biases appeared minimal. This study underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions in real-time, provides an overview of the theory that practitioners need to keep in mind when doing so with useful tools to avoid common methodological errors, and points towards areas for future research. SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat was known prior to this paperC_ST_ABSO_LIImportance of accurate estimates: Estimating epidemiological delay distributions accurately is critical for model development, epidemic forecasts, and analytic decision support. C_LIO_LIRight truncation: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g. infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Failing to account for the right truncation can lead to underestimation of the mean delay during real-time data analysis. C_LIO_LIInterval censoring: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events needs to be considered when estimating delay distributions from epidemiological data. Accounting for censoring in only one event can lead to additional biases. C_LIO_LIDynamical bias: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemics current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. Consider an analogy from demography: a growing population will contain an excess of young people, while a shrinking population will contain an excess of older people, compared to what would be expected from mortality profiles alone. Dynamical biases have been identified as significant issues in real-time epidemiological studies. C_LIO_LIExisting methods: Methods and software to adjust for censoring, truncation, and dynamic biases exist. However, many of these methods have not been systematically compared, validated, or tested outside the context in which they were originally developed. Furthermore, some of these methods do not adjust for the full range of biases. C_LI What this paper addsO_LITheory overview: An overview of the theory required to estimate distributions is provided, helping practitioners understand the underlying principles of the methods and the connections between right truncation, dynamical bias, and interval censoring. C_LIO_LIReview of methods: This paper presents a review of methods accounting for truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases in estimating epidemiological delay distributions in the context of the underlying theory. C_LIO_LIEvaluation of methods: Methods were evaluated using simulations as well as data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic. C_LIO_LICautionary guidance: This work underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions, provides clear signposting for which methods to use when, and points out areas for future research. C_LIO_LIPractical guidance: Guidance is also provided for those making use of delay distributions in routine practice. C_LI Key findingsO_LIImpact of neglecting biases: Neglecting truncation and censoring biases can lead to flawed estimates of important epidemiological parameters, especially in real-time epidemic settings. C_LIO_LIEquivalence of dynamical bias and right truncation: In the context of a growing epidemic, right truncation has an essentially equivalent effect as dynamical bias. Typically, we recommend correcting for one or the other, but not both. C_LIO_LIBias in common censoring adjustment: Taking the common approach to censoring adjustment of naively discretising observed delay into daily intervals and fitting continuous-time distributions can result in biased estimates. C_LIO_LIPerformance of methods: We identified an approximate-latent-variable method as the best overall performer, while an interval-reduced-censoring-andtruncation method was resource-efficient, widely implemented, and performed only slightly worse. C_LIO_LIInherent limitations of some methods: Other methods, such as jointly estimating primary incidence and the forward delay, and dynamic bias correction, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting. C_LIO_LIPersistence of residual biases: Residual biases persisted across all methods we investigated, largely due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the primary censoring interval follows a uniform distribution rather than one influenced by the growth rate. These are minimal if the censoring interval is small compared to other relevant time scales, as is the case for daily censoring with most human diseases. C_LI Key limitationsO_LIDifferences between right censoring and truncation: We primarily focus on right truncation, which is most relevant when the secondary events are easier to observe than primary events (e.g., symptom onset vs. infection)--in this case, we cant observe the delay until the secondary event has occurred. In other cases, we can directly observe the primary event and wait for the secondary event to occur (e.g., eventual recovery or death of a hospitalized individual)--in this case, it would be more appropriate to use right censoring to model the unresolved delays. For simplicity, we did not cover the right censoring in this paper. C_LIO_LIDaily censoring process: Our work considered only a daily interval censoring process for primary and secondary events. To mitigate this, we investigated scenarios with short delays and high growth rates, mimicking longer censoring intervals with extended delays and slower growth rates. C_LIO_LIDeviation from uniform distribution assumption: We show that the empirical distribution of event times within the primary censoring interval deviated from the common assumption of a uniform distribution due to epidemic dynamics. This discrepancy introduced a small absolute bias based on the length of the primary censoring window to all methods and was a particular issue when delay distributions were short relative to the censoring windows length. In practice, other biological factors, such as circadian rhythms, are likely to have a stronger effect than the growth rate at a daily resolution. Nonetheless, our work lays out a theoretical ground for linking epidemic dynamics to a censoring process. Further work is needed to develop robust methods for wider censoring intervals. C_LIO_LITemporal changes in delay distributions: The Ebola case study showcased considerable variation in reporting delays across the epidemic timeline, far greater than any bias due to censoring or truncation. Further work is needed to extend our methods to address such issues. C_LIO_LILack of other bias consideration: The idealized simulated scenarios we used did not account for observation error for either primary or secondary events, possibly favouring methods that do not account for real-world sources of biases. C_LIO_LILimited distributions and methods considered: We only considered lognormal distributions in this study, though our findings are generalizable to other distributions. Mixture distributions and non-parametric or hazard-based methods were not included in our assessment. C_LIO_LIExclusion of fitting discrete-time distributions: We focused on fitting continuous-time distributions throughout the paper. However, fitting discretetime distributions can be a viable option in practice, especially at a daily resolution. More work is needed to compare inferences based on discrete-time distributions vs continuous-time distributions with daily censoring. C_LIO_LIExclusion of transmission interval distributions: Our work primarily focused on inferring distributions of non-transmission intervals, leaving out potential complications related to dependent events. Additional considerations such as shared source cases, identifying intermediate hosts, and the possibility of multiple source cases for a single infectee were not factored into our analysis. C_LI\nAttribution of invasive group A streptococcal infections to varicella and respiratory virus circulation, the Netherlands, 2010-2023\nAuthors: de Gier, B.; van de Kassteele, J.; van Asten, L.; Schoffelen, A. F.; ISIS-AR Study Group, ; Hooiveld, M.; te Wierik, M. J. M.; van Sorge, N. M.; de Melker, H. E.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24300975\nBackgroundAfter the lifting of most COVID-19 control measures, many infectious diseases re-emerged in 2022. A strong increase in invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections, among both adults and young children, was reported by several countries. Viral infections such as influenza and varicella, known risk factors for iGAS infection, also increased during 2022. We estimated the proportion of GAS skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in children aged 0-5 years attributable to varicella, and the proportion of GAS pneumonia/sepsis in children aged 0-5 and adults attributable to respiratory viruses in the Netherlands. MethodsWe performed time-series regression using weekly data on influenza A and B, RSV, hMPV and SARS-CoV-2, varicella and non-invasive GAS infections, and GAS isolates cultured from blood, lower airways, skin, pus and wounds, from January 2010 to March 2023. ResultsUp to 2022, approximately 50%(95%CI 36-64%) of GAS SSTI in children were attributable to varicella. Between January 2022 and March 2023, 34%(95%CI 24-43%) of GAS SSTI cases were attributable to varicella. Of iGAS pneumonia/sepsis between January 2022 and March 2023, 25%(95%CI 18-31%) and 37%(95% CI 23-53%) was attributable to respiratory virus infections in adults and children, respectively, with the largest contributor being influenza A. ConclusionsVaricella and respiratory virus infections likely contributed to, but only partly explain, the observed iGAS increase among children and adults in 2022-2023 in the Netherlands. Public health measures to control viral infections, such as vaccination against varicella or influenza, might reduce the iGAS disease burden but will not suffice to curb the current high incidence.\nClinical Characteristics and Factors Associated with Long COVID in Zambia, August 2020 to January 2023\nAuthors: Malambo, W.; Chanda, D.; Besa, L.; Engamba, D.; Mwiinga, L.; Mwitumwa, M.; Matibula, P.; Naik, N.; Sivile, S.; Agolory, S.; Auld, A.; Mulenga, L.; Hines, J. Z.; Fwoloshi, S.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301423\nBackgroundSeveral seroprevalence studies in Africa documented the extent of spread of SARS-CoV-2, yet there is limited data on signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection (long COVID). We sought to examine patient characteristics at post-acute COVID-19 (PAC-19) clinics in Zambia and assess factors associated with long COVID at first visit to a PAC-19 clinic and longitudinally among a cohort of patients. MethodsLong COVID was defined, initially in the Zambia PAC-19 clinical guidelines, as new, relapsing or persistent symptoms lasting \u003e4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe illness was defined as COVID-19 episode that required supplemental oxygen therapy, intensive care unit stay or treatment with steroids/remdesivir. We fitted logistic regression models with cross-sectional and longitudinal data and considered statistical significance at p\u003c0.05. ResultsIn total, 1,359 patients attended PAC-19 clinics and had data abstracted from Aug-2020 to Jan-2023; 548 (40.3%) patients with [\u0026ge;]2 visits were included in the longitudinal analysis. Patients median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR]: 41-63) years, 919 (67.6%) were hospitalized for acute COVID-19, and of whom 686 (74.6%) had severe illness. Patients with hospital length of stay [\u0026ge;]15 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.06-10.3), severe illness (aOR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.68-6.75), and comorbidities (aOR:1.51; 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) had significantly higher odds of long COVID. Longitudinally, long COVID prevalence significantly (p\u003c0.001) declined from 75.4% at the first PAC-19 visit to 26.0% by the fifth visit. The median follow-up time was 7 (IQR: 4-12) weeks. ConclusionLong COVID symptoms were common among patient presenting for care in PAC-19 clinics in Zambia, but most recovered within [~]2 months. Despite potentially substantial morbidity due to long COVID, few patients overall with COVID-19 attended a PAC-19 clinic. Scaling up PAC-19 services and integrating into routine clinical care could improve access by patients.\nPopulation-based cancer incidence and mortality rates and ratios among adults with intellectual disabilities in Scotland\nAuthors: Ward, L. M.; Cooper, S.-A.; Sosenko, F.; Morrison, D.; Fleming, M.; McCowan, C.; Robb, K.; Hanna, C.; Hughes-McCormack, L.; Dunn, K.; Conway, D.; Henderson, A.; Smith, G.; Truesdale, M.; Cairns, D.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.23300433\nObjective: To provide contemporary data on cancer mortality rates within the context of incidence in the population with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Scotland's 2011 Census was used to identify adults with intellectual disabilities and controls with records linked to the Scottish Cancer Registry and death certificate data (March 2011-December 2019). The control cohort without intellectual disabilities and/or autism were used for indirect standardisation and calculation of Crude Incident Rates/Crude Mortality Rates (CIR/CMR), and age-sex Standardized Incident Rate Ratios/ Standardized Mortality Ratios (SIR/SMR), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Results: Adults with intellectual disabilities were most likely diagnosed cancers of digestive, specifically colorectal (14.2%), lung (9.3%), breast (female 22.9%), body of the uterus (female 9.3%) and male genital organs (male 17.6%). Higher incident cancers included metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SIR=1.70, male SIR=2.08), body of uterus (female SIR=1.63), ovarian (female SIR=1.59), kidney (female SIR=1.85), and testicular (male SIR=2.49). SMRs were higher, regardless of a higher, similar, or lower incidence (female SMR=1.34, male SMR=1.07). Excess mortality risk was found for colorectal (male SMR=1.59), kidney (female SMR=2.85u), female genital organs (ovarian SMR=2.86u, body of uterus SMR=2.11), breast (female SMR=1.58), and metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SMR=2.50u, male SMR=2.84). Conclusions: Adults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to die of cancer than the general population. Reasons for this may include later presentation/diagnosis (so poorer outcomes), poorer treatment/compliance, or both. Accessible public health approaches are important for people with intellectual disabilities, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the different cancer experiences faced by this population.\nFrailty, Mental Disorders, and Metabolic Syndrome: A Genetic Association and Mediation Mendelian Randomization Study\nAuthors: Deng, M.-G.; Wang, K.; Nie, J.-Q.; Liu, F.; Liang, Y.; Liu, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301316\nObjectiveTo examine the genetic associations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with frailty and mental disorders [depression, schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BIP)], along with causality between frailty and MetS and the mediating role of mental disorders. MethodsThe summary-level datasets were obtained from recent genome-wide association studies. The genetic correlation was explored from the perspectives of global and local genetic correlation. Univariate Mendelian Randomization (UMR) was used to investigate the causal link between frailty and metabolic syndrome (MetS), followed by multivariate MR to address the confounding effects of body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (PA). Finally, two-step MR analyses were conducted to examine whether the causal relationship was mediated by mental disorders. ResultsThe global genetic correlation analyses presented MetS was positively associated with frailty and depression, but reversely related to SCZ. Similarly, MetS was locally correlated to frailty, depression, and SCZ in numerous genomic regions. The UMR demonstrated that fragile people have a higher likelihood of suffering from MetS (OR: 2.773, 95% CI: 1.455-5.286, p = 0.002), and reversely people with MetS tended to be more fragile (beta: 0.211, 95% CI: 0.180-0.241, p \u003c 0.001). This bidirectional causal association still existed even after adjusting for BMI and PA. The mediation analyses implied this causality was mediated by depression, but not SCZ and BIP. ConclusionOur research provided evidence of genetic correlations between MetS and frailty, depression, and SCZ. Additionally, we discovered a bidirectional causality between frailty and MetS, with depression playing a significant mediating role.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter &#34;CAT&#34;) reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023.

MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [&amp;ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [&amp;ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [&amp;ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period.

InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest.

Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [&amp;ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [&amp;ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [&amp;ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited.

ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits.

ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

KEY POINTS

QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated?

FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID (LC) is a complex and multisystemic condition marked by a diverse range of symptoms, yet its associated risk factors remain poorly defined.

MethodsLeveraging data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), both representative of the United States population, this study aimed to identify demographic characteristics associated with LC. The sample was restricted to individuals aged 18 years and older who reported a positive COVID-19 test or doctors diagnosis. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing characteristics between participants with and without LC. Furthermore, we developed multivariate logistic regression models on demographic covariates that would have been valid at the time of the COVID-19 infection.

ResultsAmong the 124,313 individuals in BRFSS and 10,131 in the NHIS reporting either a positive test or doctors diagnosis for COVID-19 (Table), 26,783 (21.5%) in BRFSS and 1,797 (17.1%) in NHIS reported LC. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we found middle age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of a college degree, and residence in non-metropolitan areas associated with higher risk of LC. Notably, the initial severity of acute COVID-19 was strongly associated with LC risk. In contrast, significantly lower ORs were reported for Non-Hispanic Asian and Black Americans compared to Non-Hispanic White.

ConclusionsIn the United States, there is marked variation in the risk of LC by demographic factors and initial infection severity. Further research is needed to understand the underlying cause of these observations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex.

MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions.

FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (&lt;1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition.

InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden.

Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords &#34;years lived with disability&#34; &#43; &#34;COVID&#34; yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced &#34;disability-adjusted life years&#34; (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, &#34;disease burden&#34; &#43; Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact.

We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions.

Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at &lt;1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was &gt;= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions.

Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThis study estimated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on maternal death causes in Chile during the outbreak peak between 2020 and 2021.

Materials and MethodsA natural experiment was conducted using official data on maternal deaths and live births (LBs) between 1997 and 2021. Trend changes in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were assessed using segmented regression. The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected rates on MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

FindingsITS analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak impacted the MMR due to indirect causes, with a greater increase in indirect nonrespiratory causes than respiratory causes. The ARIMA forecast was consistent with ITS, showing that the expected MMR for indirect causes was substantially lower than the observed rates (9.65 in 2020 and 7.46/100,000 LBs in 2021). The expected MMR was 3.44 in 2020 and 1.55 in 2021. For nonrespiratory causes, the observed values of the MMR for 2020 (8.77/100.000 LBs) and 2021 (7.46/100.000 LBs) doubled the prediction 4.02 (95% CI: 0.44-7.61) and 3.83 (95% CI: -0.12-7.79). No significant effect was found on direct obstetrical deaths.

InterpretationDuring 2020-2021, there was a rise in the MMR in Chile attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic contributed to an escalation in the MMR due to indirect causes, particularly nonrespiratory and infectious causes, suggesting that the risk of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 was increased from previous comorbidities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates directly influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. In this study, we explore challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases. Despite their importance, these issues are frequently overlooked in the current literature, often resulting in biased conclusions. This study aims to shed light on these challenges, providing valuable insights for epidemiologists and infectious disease modellers.

Our work motivates comprehensive approaches for accounting for these issues based on the underlying theoretical concepts. We also discuss simpler methods that are widely used, which do not fully account for known biases. We evaluate the statistical performance of these methods using simulated exponential growth and epidemic scenarios informed by data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic.

Our findings highlight that using simpler methods can lead to biased estimates of vital epidemiological parameters. An approximate-latent-variable method emerges as the best overall performer, while an efficient, widely implemented interval-reduced-censoring-and-truncation method was only slightly worse. Other methods, such as a joint-primary-incidence-and-delay method and a dynamic-correction method, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, although they have inherent limitations and may not be the best choice for more complex problems.

Despite presenting a range of methods that performed well in the contexts we evaluated, residual biases persisted, predominantly due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the censoring interval follows a uniform distribution; instead, this distribution should depend on epidemic dynamics. However, in realistic scenarios with daily censoring, these biases appeared minimal. This study underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions in real-time, provides an overview of the theory that practitioners need to keep in mind when doing so with useful tools to avoid common methodological errors, and points towards areas for future research.

SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat was known prior to this paperC_ST_ABSO_LIImportance of accurate estimates: Estimating epidemiological delay distributions accurately is critical for model development, epidemic forecasts, and analytic decision support.
C_LIO_LIRight truncation: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g. infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Failing to account for the right truncation can lead to underestimation of the mean delay during real-time data analysis.
C_LIO_LIInterval censoring: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events needs to be considered when estimating delay distributions from epidemiological data. Accounting for censoring in only one event can lead to additional biases.
C_LIO_LIDynamical bias: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemics current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. Consider an analogy from demography: a growing population will contain an excess of young people, while a shrinking population will contain an excess of older people, compared to what would be expected from mortality profiles alone. Dynamical biases have been identified as significant issues in real-time epidemiological studies.
C_LIO_LIExisting methods: Methods and software to adjust for censoring, truncation, and dynamic biases exist. However, many of these methods have not been systematically compared, validated, or tested outside the context in which they were originally developed. Furthermore, some of these methods do not adjust for the full range of biases.

C_LIO_LIPractical guidance: Guidance is also provided for those making use of delay distributions in routine practice.
C_LI

Key findingsO_LIImpact of neglecting biases: Neglecting truncation and censoring biases can lead to flawed estimates of important epidemiological parameters, especially in real-time epidemic settings.
C_LIO_LIEquivalence of dynamical bias and right truncation: In the context of a growing epidemic, right truncation has an essentially equivalent effect as dynamical bias. Typically, we recommend correcting for one or the other, but not both.
C_LIO_LIBias in common censoring adjustment: Taking the common approach to censoring adjustment of naively discretising observed delay into daily intervals and fitting continuous-time distributions can result in biased estimates.
C_LIO_LIPerformance of methods: We identified an approximate-latent-variable method as the best overall performer, while an interval-reduced-censoring-andtruncation method was resource-efficient, widely implemented, and performed only slightly worse.
C_LIO_LIInherent limitations of some methods: Other methods, such as jointly estimating primary incidence and the forward delay, and dynamic bias correction, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting.
C_LIO_LIPersistence of residual biases: Residual biases persisted across all methods we investigated, largely due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the primary censoring interval follows a uniform distribution rather than one influenced by the growth rate. These are minimal if the censoring interval is small compared to other relevant time scales, as is the case for daily censoring with most human diseases.
C_LI

Key limitationsO_LIDifferences between right censoring and truncation: We primarily focus on right truncation, which is most relevant when the secondary events are easier to observe than primary events (e.g., symptom onset vs. infection)--in this case, we cant observe the delay until the secondary event has occurred. In other cases, we can directly observe the primary event and wait for the secondary event to occur (e.g., eventual recovery or death of a hospitalized individual)--in this case, it would be more appropriate to use right censoring to model the unresolved delays. For simplicity, we did not cover the right censoring in this paper.
C_LIO_LIDaily censoring process: Our work considered only a daily interval censoring process for primary and secondary events. To mitigate this, we investigated scenarios with short delays and high growth rates, mimicking longer censoring intervals with extended delays and slower growth rates.
C_LIO_LIDeviation from uniform distribution assumption: We show that the empirical distribution of event times within the primary censoring interval deviated from the common assumption of a uniform distribution due to epidemic dynamics. This discrepancy introduced a small absolute bias based on the length of the primary censoring window to all methods and was a particular issue when delay distributions were short relative to the censoring windows length. In practice, other biological factors, such as circadian rhythms, are likely to have a stronger effect than the growth rate at a daily resolution. Nonetheless, our work lays out a theoretical ground for linking epidemic dynamics to a censoring process. Further work is needed to develop robust methods for wider censoring intervals.
C_LIO_LITemporal changes in delay distributions: The Ebola case study showcased considerable variation in reporting delays across the epidemic timeline, far greater than any bias due to censoring or truncation. Further work is needed to extend our methods to address such issues.
C_LIO_LILack of other bias consideration: The idealized simulated scenarios we used did not account for observation error for either primary or secondary events, possibly favouring methods that do not account for real-world sources of biases.
C_LIO_LILimited distributions and methods considered: We only considered lognormal distributions in this study, though our findings are generalizable to other distributions. Mixture distributions and non-parametric or hazard-based methods were not included in our assessment.
C_LIO_LIExclusion of fitting discrete-time distributions: We focused on fitting continuous-time distributions throughout the paper. However, fitting discretetime distributions can be a viable option in practice, especially at a daily resolution. More work is needed to compare inferences based on discrete-time distributions vs continuous-time distributions with daily censoring.
C_LIO_LIExclusion of transmission interval distributions: Our work primarily focused on inferring distributions of non-transmission intervals, leaving out potential complications related to dependent events. Additional considerations such as shared source cases, identifying intermediate hosts, and the possibility of multiple source cases for a single infectee were not factored into our analysis.

A strong increase in invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections, among both adults and young children, was reported by several countries. Viral infections such as influenza and varicella, known risk factors for iGAS infection, also increased during 2022. We estimated the proportion of GAS skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in children aged 0-5 years attributable to varicella, and the proportion of GAS pneumonia/sepsis in children aged 0-5 and adults attributable to respiratory viruses in the Netherlands.

MethodsWe performed time-series regression using weekly data on influenza A and B, RSV, hMPV and SARS-CoV-2, varicella and non-invasive GAS infections, and GAS isolates cultured from blood, lower airways, skin, pus and wounds, from January 2010 to March 2023.

ResultsUp to 2022, approximately 50%(95%CI 36-64%) of GAS SSTI in children were attributable to varicella. Between January 2022 and March 2023, 34%(95%CI 24-43%) of GAS SSTI cases were attributable to varicella. Of iGAS pneumonia/sepsis between January 2022 and March 2023, 25%(95%CI 18-31%) and 37%(95% CI 23-53%) was attributable to respiratory virus infections in adults and children, respectively, with the largest contributor being influenza A.

ConclusionsVaricella and respiratory virus infections likely contributed to, but only partly explain, the observed iGAS increase among children and adults in 2022-2023 in the Netherlands. Public health measures to control viral infections, such as vaccination against varicella or influenza, might reduce the iGAS disease burden but will not suffice to curb the current high incidence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSeveral seroprevalence studies in Africa documented the extent of spread of SARS-CoV-2, yet there is limited data on signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection (long COVID). We sought to examine patient characteristics at post-acute COVID-19 (PAC-19) clinics in Zambia and assess factors associated with long COVID at first visit to a PAC-19 clinic and longitudinally among a cohort of patients.

MethodsLong COVID was defined, initially in the Zambia PAC-19 clinical guidelines, as new, relapsing or persistent symptoms lasting &gt;4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe illness was defined as COVID-19 episode that required supplemental oxygen therapy, intensive care unit stay or treatment with steroids/remdesivir. We fitted logistic regression models with cross-sectional and longitudinal data and considered statistical significance at p&lt;0.05.

ResultsIn total, 1,359 patients attended PAC-19 clinics and had data abstracted from Aug-2020 to Jan-2023; 548 (40.3%) patients with [&amp;ge;]2 visits were included in the longitudinal analysis. Patients median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR]: 41-63) years, 919 (67.6%) were hospitalized for acute COVID-19, and of whom 686 (74.6%) had severe illness. Patients with hospital length of stay [&amp;ge;]15 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.06-10.3), severe illness (aOR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.68-6.75), and comorbidities (aOR:1.51; 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) had significantly higher odds of long COVID. Longitudinally, long COVID prevalence significantly (p&lt;0.001) declined from 75.4% at the first PAC-19 visit to 26.0% by the fifth visit. The median follow-up time was 7 (IQR: 4-12) weeks.

ConclusionLong COVID symptoms were common among patient presenting for care in PAC-19 clinics in Zambia, but most recovered within [~]2 months. Despite potentially substantial morbidity due to long COVID, few patients overall with COVID-19 attended a PAC-19 clinic. Scaling up PAC-19 services and integrating into routine clinical care could improve access by patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: To provide contemporary data on cancer mortality rates within the context of incidence in the population with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Scotland&#39;s 2011 Census was used to identify adults with intellectual disabilities and controls with records linked to the Scottish Cancer Registry and death certificate data (March 2011-December 2019). The control cohort without intellectual disabilities and/or autism were used for indirect standardisation and calculation of Crude Incident Rates/Crude Mortality Rates (CIR/CMR), and age-sex Standardized Incident Rate Ratios/ Standardized Mortality Ratios (SIR/SMR), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Results: Adults with intellectual disabilities were most likely diagnosed cancers of digestive, specifically colorectal (14.2%), lung (9.3%), breast (female 22.9%), body of the uterus (female 9.3%) and male genital organs (male 17.6%). Higher incident cancers included metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SIR=1.70, male SIR=2.08), body of uterus (female SIR=1.63), ovarian (female SIR=1.59), kidney (female SIR=1.85), and testicular (male SIR=2.49). SMRs were higher, regardless of a higher, similar, or lower incidence (female SMR=1.34, male SMR=1.07). Excess mortality risk was found for colorectal (male SMR=1.59), kidney (female SMR=2.85u), female genital organs (ovarian SMR=2.86u, body of uterus SMR=2.11), breast (female SMR=1.58), and metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SMR=2.50u, male SMR=2.84). Conclusions: Adults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to die of cancer than the general population. Reasons for this may include later presentation/diagnosis (so poorer outcomes), poorer treatment/compliance, or both. Accessible public health approaches are important for people with intellectual disabilities, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the different cancer experiences faced by this population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo examine the genetic associations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) with frailty and mental disorders [depression, schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BIP)], along with causality between frailty and MetS and the mediating role of mental disorders.

MethodsThe summary-level datasets were obtained from recent genome-wide association studies. The genetic correlation was explored from the perspectives of global and local genetic correlation. Univariate Mendelian Randomization (UMR) was used to investigate the causal link between frailty and metabolic syndrome (MetS), followed by multivariate MR to address the confounding effects of body mass index (BMI) and physical activity (PA). Finally, two-step MR analyses were conducted to examine whether the causal relationship was mediated by mental disorders.

ResultsThe global genetic correlation analyses presented MetS was positively associated with frailty and depression, but reversely related to SCZ. Similarly, MetS was locally correlated to frailty, depression, and SCZ in numerous genomic regions. The UMR demonstrated that fragile people have a higher likelihood of suffering from MetS (OR: 2.773, 95% CI: 1.455-5.286, p = 0.002), and reversely people with MetS tended to be more fragile (beta: 0.211, 95% CI: 0.180-0.241, p &lt; 0.001). This bidirectional causal association still existed even after adjusting for BMI and PA. The mediation analyses implied this causality was mediated by depression, but not SCZ and BIP.

ConclusionOur research provided evidence of genetic correlations between MetS and frailty, depression, and SCZ. Additionally, we discovered a bidirectional causality between frailty and MetS, with depression playing a significant mediating role.</p>
