Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.\nVentilation during COVID-19 in a school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).\nAuthors: Zand, M. S.; Spallina, S.; Ross, A.; Zandi, K.; Pawlowski, A.; Seplaki, C.; Herington, J.; Corbett, A.; Kaukeinen, K.; Freedman, E.; Holden-Wiltse, J.; Alcantara, L.; Li, D.; Cameron, A.; Beaumont, N.; Dozier, A.; Dewhurst, S.; Foxe, J.\nScore: 73.8, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295268\nBackgroundThis study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 [\u0026ge;]1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation. MethodsWe established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[\u0026le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[\u0026ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [\u0026ge;]1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project. ConclusionsThere was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations [\u0026ge;]1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.\nIs influenza B/Yamagata extinct and what public health implications could this have? An updated literature review and comprehensive assessment of global surveillance databases.\nAuthors: Caini, S.; Meijer, A.; Nunes, M. C.; Henaff, L.; Zounon, M.; Boudewijns, B.; Del Riccio, M.; Paget, J.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296068\nIntroductionEarly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information. MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide. ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation. DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.\nProtocol for the development of a tool (INSPECT-SR) to identify problematic randomised controlled trials in systematic reviews of health interventions.\nAuthors: Wilkinson, J.

J.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295626\nIntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data, and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed, and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions. Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.\nModel-based impact evaluation of new tuberculosis vaccines in aging populations under different modeling scenarios: the case of China.\nAuthors: Tovar, M.; Sanz, J.; Moreno, Y.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.23296224\nThe slow descent in TB burden, the COVID-19 pandemic, along the rise of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seriously threaten TB control and the goals of the End TB strategy. To fight back, several vaccine candidates are under development, with some of them undergoing phases 2B and 3 of the development pipeline. The impact of these vaccines on the general population needs to be addressed using disease-transmission models, and, in a country like China, which last year ranked third in number of cases worldwide, and where the population is undergoing a fast process of demographic aging, the impact of TB vaccination campaigns may depend heavily upon the age of targeted populations and with the mechanistic descriptions of the TB vaccines. For these reasons, transmission models need to capture the coupling between TB dynamics and demographic evolution, as well as to be able to accommodate different mechanistic descriptions of TB vaccine protection. In this work, we studied the potential impact of a new TB vaccine in China targeting adolescents (15-19 y.o.) or elderly people (60-64 y.o.), according to varying vaccine descriptions that represent reasonable mechanisms of action leading to prevention of disease (PoD), or prevention of recurrence (PoR), each of them targetting specific routes to TB disease. To measure the influence of the description of the coupling between transmission dynamics and aging in TB transmission models, we explored two different approaches to compute the evolution of the contact matrices, which relate to the spreading among different age strata. Our results show that the magnitude of model-based impact estimates substantially depends upon the vaccine profile, and it is also strongly related to the modeling approach chosen to describe the time evolution of contact matrices. In spite of these sources of uncertainty, our results also show, in line with previous modeling works, that elder vaccination is a suitable option in China to reduce the incidence of TB.\nPrevalence of Long COVID-associated symptoms in adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany: Results of the population-based study: Corona Monitoring Nationwide 2021/22 (RKI-SOEP-2)\nAuthors: Poethko-Mueller, C.; Ordonez-Cruickshank, A.; Nuebel, J.; Sarganas, G.; Goesswald, A.; Schmid, L.; Schaffrath Rosario, A.; Hoebel, J.; Schlaud, M.; Scheidt-Nave, C.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295426\nBackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to \"Long COVID\" and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge. AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany. MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [\u0026ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection. Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p\u003c0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p\u003c0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p\u003c0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p\u003c0.001). [\u0026ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0). ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.\nNumber of children and mid- to later-life cognitive function and cognitive impairment in rural South Africa: Evidence from \"Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa\" (HAALSI)\nAuthors: Phillips, M. L.; Kobayashi, L. C.; Chakraborty, R.; Wagner, R.; Mahlalela, N.; Brown, J. W.; Harezlak, J.; Ludema, C.; Rosenberg, M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is projected to rise substantially by 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with aging populations. Reproductive life history may be associated with later-life cognitive function. We aim to estimate the association between number of children and mid- to later-life cognitive performance. MethodData were from 5059 older adults (46% men) aged [\u0026ge;]40 years in the population-representative rural cohort of the \"Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa\" (HAALSI). We fit linear regression and modified Poisson models to estimate the associations between number of children and cognitive function. Analyses were stratified by sex/gender, controlling for age, education, literacy, self-reported childhood health, country of birth, and fathers occupation. ResultsAfter adjustment, men with any number of children and women with 5+ children had higher cognitive function compared to those without children ({beta}[95% CI]: Men: 1-2: 0.29[0.13 - 0.45], 3-4: 0.50[0.34 - 0.65], 5+: 0.48[0.33 - 0.63]; Women: 5+: 0.17[0.01 - 0.34]). Results from the adjusted modified Poisson regression models found that for men and women, groups with any number of children showed a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment than the group with 0 children (PR[95% CI] Men: 1-2: 0.48[0.31 - 0.75], 3-4: 0.21[0.12 - 0.37], 5+: 0.28[0.19 - 0.41], Women: 1-2: 0.52[0.31 - 0.88], 3-4: 0.55[0.33 - 0.91], 5+: 0.41[0.25 - 0.69]). ConclusionAmong older rural South African adults, having children was associated with greater cognitive performance and lower prevalence of cognitive impairment. Men tended to have larger protective associations than women, which may be due to sex/gender differences in biological and social roles of childbearing and rearing. Understanding the complex relationship between having children and later-life cognitive function may help identify interventions to reduce the impact of cognitive decline.\nNear-term forecasting of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations in Aotearoa New Zealand\nAuthors: Plank, M. J.; Watson, L. M.; Maclaren, O. J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296118\nNear-term forecasting of infectious disease incidence and consequent demand for acute healthcare services can support capacity planning and public health responses. Despite well-developed scenario modelling to support the Covid-19 response, Aotearoa New Zealand lacks advanced infectious disease forecasting capacity. We develop a model using Aotearoa New Zealands unique Covid-19 data streams to predict reported Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and hospital occupancy. The method combines a semi-mechanistic model for disease transmission to predict cases with Gaussian process regression models to predict the fraction of reported cases that will require hospital treatment. We evaluate forecast performance against out-of-sample data over the period from 2 October 2022 to 23 July 2023. Our results show that forecast performance is reasonably good over a 1-3 week time horizon, although generally deteriorates as the time horizon is lengthened. The model has been operationalised to provide weekly national and regional forecasts in real-time. This study is an important step towards development of more sophisticated situational awareness and infectious disease forecasting tools in Aotearoa New Zealand. Author summaryThe emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has ended, but Covid-19 continues to put significant additional load on stretched healthcare systems. Forecasting the number of hospital cases caused an infectious disease like Covid-19 over the next few weeks can help with effective planning and response. The ability to forecast reliably requires timely, high-quality data and accurate mathematical models. We have developed a model for forecasting the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The model works in two stages: firstly predicting the number of new cases and secondly estimating the proportion of those cases that will need hospital treatment. The model produces a range of likely values, which is important because is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. We show that the model does a reasonably good job of predicting hospitalisations up to 3 weeks ahead. The model has been used by public health agencies in Aotearoa New Zealand to help with healthcare capacity planning.\nSerological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection by vaccination status and variant in England\nAuthors: Quinot, C.; Lunt, R.; Kirsebom, F.; Andrews, N.; Whitaker, H.; Skarnes, C.; Letley, L.; Haskins, D.; Angel, C.; Firminger, S.; Ratcliffe, K.; Sheridan, A.; Rajan, S.; Akindele, L.; Ijaz, S.; Zambon, M.; Brown, K.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.\nScore: 137.1, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295073\nBackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant. MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported. ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant). ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.\nAfter the Infection: A Survey of Pathogens and Non-communicable Human Disease\nAuthors: Lape, M.; Schnell, D.; Parameswaran, S.; Ernst, K.; Salomonis, N.; Martin, L. J.; Harnett, B. M.; Kottyan, L. C.; Weirauch, M. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295428\nThere are many well-established relationships between pathogens and human disease, but far fewer when focusing on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We leverage data from The UK Biobank and TriNetX to perform a systematic survey across 20 pathogens and 426 diseases, focused primarily on NCDs. To this end, we assess the association between disease status and infection history proxies. We identify 206 pathogen-disease pairs that replicate in both cohorts. We replicate many established relationships, including Helicobacter pylori with several gastroenterological diseases, and connections between Epstein-Barr virus with multiple sclerosis and lupus. Overall, our approach identified evidence of association for 15 of the pathogens and 96 distinct diseases, including a currently controversial link between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We validate this connection through two orthogonal analyses, revealing increased CMV gene expression in UC patients and enrichment for UC genetic risk signal near human genes that have altered expression upon CMV infection. Collectively, these results form a foundation for future investigations into mechanistic roles played by pathogens in disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 has become endemic, with dynamics that reflect the waning of immunity and re-exposure, by contrast to the epidemic phase driven by exposure in immunologically naive populations. Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThis study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 [&amp;ge;]1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation.

MethodsWe established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months.

Results97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[&amp;le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[&amp;ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [&amp;ge;]1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project.

ConclusionsThere was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations [&amp;ge;]1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEarly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information.

MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide.

ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation.

DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data, and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed, and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions.

Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The slow descent in TB burden, the COVID-19 pandemic, along the rise of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seriously threaten TB control and the goals of the End TB strategy. To fight back, several vaccine candidates are under development, with some of them undergoing phases 2B and 3 of the development pipeline. The impact of these vaccines on the general population needs to be addressed using disease-transmission models, and, in a country like China, which last year ranked third in number of cases worldwide, and where the population is undergoing a fast process of demographic aging, the impact of TB vaccination campaigns may depend heavily upon the age of targeted populations and with the mechanistic descriptions of the TB vaccines. For these reasons, transmission models need to capture the coupling between TB dynamics and demographic evolution, as well as to be able to accommodate different mechanistic descriptions of TB vaccine protection. In this work, we studied the potential impact of a new TB vaccine in China targeting adolescents (15-19 y.o.) or elderly people (60-64 y.o.), according to varying vaccine descriptions that represent reasonable mechanisms of action leading to prevention of disease (PoD), or prevention of recurrence (PoR), each of them targetting specific routes to TB disease. To measure the influence of the description of the coupling between transmission dynamics and aging in TB transmission models, we explored two different approaches to compute the evolution of the contact matrices, which relate to the spreading among different age strata. Our results show that the magnitude of model-based impact estimates substantially depends upon the vaccine profile, and it is also strongly related to the modeling approach chosen to describe the time evolution of contact matrices. In spite of these sources of uncertainty, our results also show, in line with previous modeling works, that elder vaccination is a suitable option in China to reduce the incidence of TB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to &#34;Long COVID&#34; and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge.

AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany.

MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [&amp;ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection.

Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p&lt;0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p&lt;0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p&lt;0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p&lt;0.001). [&amp;ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0).

ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is projected to rise substantially by 2050, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with aging populations. Reproductive life history may be associated with later-life cognitive function. We aim to estimate the association between number of children and mid- to later-life cognitive performance.

MethodData were from 5059 older adults (46% men) aged [&amp;ge;]40 years in the population-representative rural cohort of the &#34;Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa&#34; (HAALSI). We fit linear regression and modified Poisson models to estimate the associations between number of children and cognitive function. Analyses were stratified by sex/gender, controlling for age, education, literacy, self-reported childhood health, country of birth, and fathers occupation.

ResultsAfter adjustment, men with any number of children and women with 5&#43; children had higher cognitive function compared to those without children ({beta}[95% CI]: Men: 1-2: 0.29[0.13 - 0.45], 3-4: 0.50[0.34 - 0.65], 5&#43;: 0.48[0.33 - 0.63]; Women: 5&#43;: 0.17[0.01 - 0.34]). Results from the adjusted modified Poisson regression models found that for men and women, groups with any number of children showed a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment than the group with 0 children (PR[95% CI] Men: 1-2: 0.48[0.31 - 0.75], 3-4: 0.21[0.12 - 0.37], 5&#43;: 0.28[0.19 - 0.41], Women: 1-2: 0.52[0.31 - 0.88], 3-4: 0.55[0.33 - 0.91], 5&#43;: 0.41[0.25 - 0.69]).

ConclusionAmong older rural South African adults, having children was associated with greater cognitive performance and lower prevalence of cognitive impairment. Men tended to have larger protective associations than women, which may be due to sex/gender differences in biological and social roles of childbearing and rearing. Understanding the complex relationship between having children and later-life cognitive function may help identify interventions to reduce the impact of cognitive decline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Near-term forecasting of infectious disease incidence and consequent demand for acute healthcare services can support capacity planning and public health responses. Despite well-developed scenario modelling to support the Covid-19 response, Aotearoa New Zealand lacks advanced infectious disease forecasting capacity. We develop a model using Aotearoa New Zealands unique Covid-19 data streams to predict reported Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and hospital occupancy. The method combines a semi-mechanistic model for disease transmission to predict cases with Gaussian process regression models to predict the fraction of reported cases that will require hospital treatment. We evaluate forecast performance against out-of-sample data over the period from 2 October 2022 to 23 July 2023. Our results show that forecast performance is reasonably good over a 1-3 week time horizon, although generally deteriorates as the time horizon is lengthened. The model has been operationalised to provide weekly national and regional forecasts in real-time. This study is an important step towards development of more sophisticated situational awareness and infectious disease forecasting tools in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Author summaryThe emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has ended, but Covid-19 continues to put significant additional load on stretched healthcare systems. Forecasting the number of hospital cases caused an infectious disease like Covid-19 over the next few weeks can help with effective planning and response. The ability to forecast reliably requires timely, high-quality data and accurate mathematical models. We have developed a model for forecasting the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The model works in two stages: firstly predicting the number of new cases and secondly estimating the proportion of those cases that will need hospital treatment. The model produces a range of likely values, which is important because is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. We show that the model does a reasonably good job of predicting hospitalisations up to 3 weeks ahead. The model has been used by public health agencies in Aotearoa New Zealand to help with healthcare capacity planning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant.

MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported.

ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant).

ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There are many well-established relationships between pathogens and human disease, but far fewer when focusing on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We leverage data from The UK Biobank and TriNetX to perform a systematic survey across 20 pathogens and 426 diseases, focused primarily on NCDs. To this end, we assess the association between disease status and infection history proxies. We identify 206 pathogen-disease pairs that replicate in both cohorts. We replicate many established relationships, including Helicobacter pylori with several gastroenterological diseases, and connections between Epstein-Barr virus with multiple sclerosis and lupus. Overall, our approach identified evidence of association for 15 of the pathogens and 96 distinct diseases, including a currently controversial link between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We validate this connection through two orthogonal analyses, revealing increased CMV gene expression in UC patients and enrichment for UC genetic risk signal near human genes that have altered expression upon CMV infection. Collectively, these results form a foundation for future investigations into mechanistic roles played by pathogens in disease.</p>
