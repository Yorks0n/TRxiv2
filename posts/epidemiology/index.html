Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ. We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality. Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.\nEstimated number of lives directly saved by COVID-19 vaccination programs in the WHO European Region, December 2020 to March 2023\nAuthors: Mesle, M. M.; Brown, J.; Mook, P.; Katz, M. A.; Hagan, J.; Pastore, R.; Nitzan, D.; Benka, B.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Bossuyt, N.; Stouten, V.; Vernemmen, C.; Constantinou, E.; Kyncl, J.; Maly, M.; Sanca, O.; Grove Krause, T.; Skafte Vestergaard, L.; Leino, T.; Poukka, E.; Gkolfinopoulou, K.; Mellou, K.; Maria Tsintziloni, M.; Molnar, Z.; Aspelund, G.; Thordardottir, M.; Domegan, L.; Kelly, E.; O'Donell, J.; Sacco, C.; Riccardo, F.; Mateo Urdiales, A.; Bumsteinas, V.; Liausediene, R.; Mossong, J.; Vergison, A.; Borg, M.-L.; Melillo, T.; Kocinski, D.; Pollozhani, E.; Meijerink, H.; Costa, D.; Pa\nScore: 761.2, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301206\nBackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter \"CAT\") reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023. MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths. FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [\u0026ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [\u0026ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [\u0026ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period. InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures. FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest. Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [\u0026ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [\u0026ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [\u0026ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967). Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.\nMR-link-2: pleiotropy robust cis Mendelian randomization validated in four independent gold-standard datasets of causality\nAuthors: van der Graaf, A.; Warmerdam, R.; Auwerx, C. M. P.; eQTLGen Consortium, ; Vosa, U.; Borges, M. C.; Franke, L.; Kutalik, Z.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301400\nMendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures. To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.\nSafety of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine batches: A nationwide cohort study\nAuthors: Hviid, A.; Bech Svalgaard, I.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301520\nBackgroundThe safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been extensively evaluated since the global rollout began. While serious adverse events are rare, safety issues continue to arise. This study evaluates the claim that earlier small vaccine batches were associated with higher rates of serious adverse events compared to later batches. MethodsA nationwide cohort study was conducted in Denmark, comprising individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine from 52 pre-defined batches classified into three pre-defined groups. Vaccinated individuals were matched 1:1 between batch groups on age, sex, and vaccination priority group. The study outcomes, included 27 serious adverse events, 2 negative control outcomes and all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing rates between batch groups in the 28-days following vaccination. We conducted two comparisons of the early small batches to two groups of larger batches used later in the pandemic. ResultsIn the study period, 9,983,448 vaccinations were administered from batches in the three pre-defined groups. Slightly increased rates of arrhythmia were observed in both study comparisons, HRs 1.25 (95% CI,1.05-1.50) and 1.15 (1.00-1.31), respectively, but sensitivity analyses did not robustly support these associations. For the remaining outcomes, increased rates in both study comparisons were not observed. ConclusionThis nationwide cohort study provides reassurance regarding the safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine across different batches used in Denmark. The findings support the overall safety of the vaccine, with no clinically relevant variations in serious adverse event rates between batches.\nEffect of Paxlovid Treatment on Long COVID Onset: An EHR-Based Target Trial Emulation from N3C\nAuthors: Preiss, A.; Bhatia, A.; Zang, C.; Aragon, L. V.; Baratta, J. M.; Baskaran, M.; Blancero, F.; Brannock, M. D.; Chew, R. F.; Diaz, I.; Fitzgerald, M.; Kelly, E. P.; Zhou, A. G.; Weiner, M. G.; Carton, T. W.; Wang, F.; Kaushal, R.; Chute, C. G.; Haendel, M.; Moffitt, R.; Pfaff, E.; N3C, ; RECOVER, Score: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301525\nPreventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,461 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. Our primary outcome measure was a PASC computable phenotype. Secondary outcomes were the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.01). However, its effect varied across the cognitive (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.90), fatigue (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), and respiratory (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.02) symptom clusters, suggesting that Paxlovid treatment may help prevent post-acute cognitive and fatigue symptoms more than others.\nInferring the sensitivity of wastewater metagenomic sequencing for pathogen early detection\nAuthors: Grimm, S. L.; Kaufman, J. T.; Rice, D. P.; Whittaker, C.; Bradshaw, W. J.; McLaren, M. R.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300450\nDetecting novel pathogens at an early stage requires robust early warning that is both sensitive and pathogen-agnostic. Wastewater metagenomic sequencing (W-MGS) could meet these goals, but its sensitivity and financial feasibility depend on the relative abundance of novel pathogen sequences in W-MGS data. Here we collate W-MGS data from a diverse range of studies to characterize the relative abundance of known viruses in wastewater. We then develop a Bayesian statistical model to integrate these data with epidemiological estimates for 13 human-infecting viruses, and use it to estimate the expected relative abundance of different viral pathogens for a given prevalence or incidence in the community. Our results reveal pronounced variation between studies, with estimates differing by one to three orders of magnitude for the same pathogen: for example, the expected relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 at 1% weekly incidence varied between 10-7 and 10-10. Integrating these estimates with a simple cost model highlights similarly wide inter-study and inter-pathogen variation in the cost of W-MGS-based early detection, with a mean yearly cost estimate of roughly $19,000 for a Norovirus-like pathogen and $2.9 million for a SARS-CoV-2-like pathogen at 1% incidence. The model and parameter estimates presented here represent an important resource for future investigation into the performance of wastewater MGS, and can be extended to incorporate new wastewater datasets as they become available.\nCOVID-19 vaccine uptake and effectiveness by time since vaccination in the Western Cape province, South Africa: An observational cohort study during 2020-2022\nAuthors: Kassanjee, R.; Davies, M.-A.; Heekes, A.; Mahomed, H.; Hawkridge, A. J.; Wolmarans, M.; Morden, E.; Jacobs, T.; Cohen, C.; Moultrie, H.; Lessells, R. J.; Van der Walt, N.; Arendse, J. O.; Goeiman, H.; Mudaly, V.; Wolter, N.; Walaza, S.; Jassat, W.; von Gottberg, A.; Hannan, P. L.; Rousseau, P.; Feikin, D.; Cloete, K.; Boulle, A.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301721\nBackground There are few data on the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and boosting in Africa, which experienced high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mostly vaccine-naive population, and has limited vaccine coverage and competing health service priorities. We assessed the association between vaccination and severe COVID-19 in the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods We performed an observational cohort study of \u003e2 million adults during 2020-2022. We described SARS-CoV-2 testing, COVID-19 outcomes, and vaccine uptake over time. We used multivariable cox models to estimate the association of BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccination with COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, adjusting for demographic characteristics, underlying health conditions, socioeconomic status proxies and healthcare utilisation. Results By end 2022, only 41% of surviving adults had completed vaccination and 8% a booster dose, despite several waves of severe COVID-19. Recent vaccination was associated with notable reductions in severe COVID-19 during distinct analysis periods dominated by Delta, Omicron BA.1/2 and BA.4/5 (sub)lineages: within 6 months of completing vaccination or boosting, vaccine effectiveness was 46-92% for death (range across periods), 45-92% for admission with severe disease or death, and 25-90% for any admission or death. During the Omicron BA.4/5 wave, within 3 months of vaccination or boosting, BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S were each 84% effective against death (95% CIs: 57-94 and 49-95, respectively). However, there were distinct reductions of VE at larger times post completing or boosting vaccination. Conclusions Continued emphasis on regular COVID-19 vaccination including boosting is important for those at high risk of severe COVID-19 even in settings with widespread infection-induced immunity.\nUnifying human infectious disease models and real-time awareness of population- and subpopulation-level intervention effectiveness\nAuthors: Seibel, R. L.; Tildesley, M. J.; Hill, E. M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301344\nBackgroundDuring infectious disease outbreaks, humans often base their decision to adhere to an intervention strategy on their personal opinion towards the intervention, perceived risk of infection and intervention effectiveness. However, due to data limitations and inference challenges, infectious disease models usually omit variables that may impact an individuals decision to get vaccinated and their awareness of the interventions effectiveness of disease control within their social contacts as well as the overall population. MethodsWe constructed a compartmental, deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) disease model that includes a behavioural function with parameters influencing intervention uptake. The behavioural function accounted for an initial subpopulation opinion towards an intervention, their outbreak information sensitivity and the extent they are swayed by the real-time intervention effectiveness information (at a subpopulation- and population-level). Applying the model to vaccination uptake and three human pathogens - pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus - we explored through model simulation how these intervention adherence decision parameters and behavioural heterogeneity in the population impacted epidemiological outcomes. ResultsFrom our model simulations we found that differences in preference towards outbreak information were pathogen-specific. Therefore, in some pathogen systems, outbreak information types at different outbreak stages may be more informative to an information-sensitive population and lead to less severe epidemic outcomes. In both behaviourally-homogeneous and behaviourally-heterogeneous populations, pandemic influenza showed patterns distinct from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola for cumulative epidemiological metrics of interest. Furthermore, there was notable sensitivity in outbreak size under different assumptions regarding the population split in behavioural traits. Outbreak information preference was sensitive to vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the importance of considering human behaviour during outbreaks in the context of the perceived effectiveness of the intervention. ImplicationsIncorporating behavioural functions that modify infection control intervention adherence into epidemiological models can aid our understanding of adherence dynamics during outbreaks. Ultimately, by parameterising models with what we know about human behaviour towards vaccination (and other infection control interventions) adherence, such models can help assist decision makers during outbreaks. Such progress will be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases when there is initially little information on the disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness.\nSuperspreading of SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review and meta-analysis of event attack rates and individual transmission patterns\nAuthors: McKee, C.

To better quantify heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly superspreading, we performed a systematic review of transmission events with data on secondary attack rates or contact tracing of individual index cases published before September 2021, prior to emergence of variants of concern and widespread vaccination. We reviewed 592 distinct events and 9,883 index cases from 491 papers. Meta-analysis of secondary attack rates identified substantial heterogeneity across 12 event types/settings, with the highest transmission (25-35%) in co-living situations including households, nursing homes, and other congregate housing. Among index cases, 67% produced zero secondary cases and only 3% (287) infected \u003e5 secondary cases (\"superspreaders\"). The highest percentage of superspreaders was among symptomatic individuals, individuals aged 49-64 years, and individuals with over 100 total contacts. However, only 55% of index cases reported age, sex, symptoms, real-time PCR cycle threshold values, or total contacts. Despite the limitations, our review highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading is more likely in settings with prolonged close contact and among symptomatic adults with many contacts. Enhanced reporting on transmission events and contact tracing could help explain heterogeneity and facilitate control efforts.\nPrevalence of Falciparum and non-Falciparum Malaria in the 2014-15 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey\nAuthors: Gaither, C.; Morgan, C.; Kirby, R.; Karema, C.; Gashema, P.; White, S.; Topazian, H.

Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs. MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors. ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria. ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Several trials of different designs were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and/or the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ.

We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality.

Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter &#34;CAT&#34;) reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023.

MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [&amp;ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [&amp;ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [&amp;ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period.

InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest.

Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [&amp;ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [&amp;ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [&amp;ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures. To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been extensively evaluated since the global rollout began. While serious adverse events are rare, safety issues continue to arise. This study evaluates the claim that earlier small vaccine batches were associated with higher rates of serious adverse events compared to later batches.

MethodsA nationwide cohort study was conducted in Denmark, comprising individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine from 52 pre-defined batches classified into three pre-defined groups. Vaccinated individuals were matched 1:1 between batch groups on age, sex, and vaccination priority group. The study outcomes, included 27 serious adverse events, 2 negative control outcomes and all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing rates between batch groups in the 28-days following vaccination. We conducted two comparisons of the early small batches to two groups of larger batches used later in the pandemic.

ResultsIn the study period, 9,983,448 vaccinations were administered from batches in the three pre-defined groups. Slightly increased rates of arrhythmia were observed in both study comparisons, HRs 1.25 (95% CI,1.05-1.50) and 1.15 (1.00-1.31), respectively, but sensitivity analyses did not robustly support these associations. For the remaining outcomes, increased rates in both study comparisons were not observed.

ConclusionThis nationwide cohort study provides reassurance regarding the safety of the BNT162b2 vaccine across different batches used in Denmark. The findings support the overall safety of the vaccine, with no clinically relevant variations in serious adverse event rates between batches.</p>

In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,461 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. Our primary outcome measure was a PASC computable phenotype. Secondary outcomes were the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.01). However, its effect varied across the cognitive (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.90), fatigue (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), and respiratory (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.02) symptom clusters, suggesting that Paxlovid treatment may help prevent post-acute cognitive and fatigue symptoms more than others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Detecting novel pathogens at an early stage requires robust early warning that is both sensitive and pathogen-agnostic. Wastewater metagenomic sequencing (W-MGS) could meet these goals, but its sensitivity and financial feasibility depend on the relative abundance of novel pathogen sequences in W-MGS data. Here we collate W-MGS data from a diverse range of studies to characterize the relative abundance of known viruses in wastewater. We then develop a Bayesian statistical model to integrate these data with epidemiological estimates for 13 human-infecting viruses, and use it to estimate the expected relative abundance of different viral pathogens for a given prevalence or incidence in the community. Our results reveal pronounced variation between studies, with estimates differing by one to three orders of magnitude for the same pathogen: for example, the expected relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 at 1% weekly incidence varied between 10-7 and 10-10. Integrating these estimates with a simple cost model highlights similarly wide inter-study and inter-pathogen variation in the cost of W-MGS-based early detection, with a mean yearly cost estimate of roughly $19,000 for a Norovirus-like pathogen and $2.9 million for a SARS-CoV-2-like pathogen at 1% incidence. The model and parameter estimates presented here represent an important resource for future investigation into the performance of wastewater MGS, and can be extended to incorporate new wastewater datasets as they become available.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background There are few data on the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and boosting in Africa, which experienced high levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mostly vaccine-naive population, and has limited vaccine coverage and competing health service priorities. We assessed the association between vaccination and severe COVID-19 in the Western Cape, South Africa. Methods We performed an observational cohort study of &gt;2 million adults during 2020-2022. We described SARS-CoV-2 testing, COVID-19 outcomes, and vaccine uptake over time. We used multivariable cox models to estimate the association of BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccination with COVID-19-related hospitalisation and death, adjusting for demographic characteristics, underlying health conditions, socioeconomic status proxies and healthcare utilisation. Results By end 2022, only 41% of surviving adults had completed vaccination and 8% a booster dose, despite several waves of severe COVID-19. Recent vaccination was associated with notable reductions in severe COVID-19 during distinct analysis periods dominated by Delta, Omicron BA.1/2 and BA.4/5 (sub)lineages: within 6 months of completing vaccination or boosting, vaccine effectiveness was 46-92% for death (range across periods), 45-92% for admission with severe disease or death, and 25-90% for any admission or death. During the Omicron BA.4/5 wave, within 3 months of vaccination or boosting, BNT162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S were each 84% effective against death (95% CIs: 57-94 and 49-95, respectively). However, there were distinct reductions of VE at larger times post completing or boosting vaccination. Conclusions Continued emphasis on regular COVID-19 vaccination including boosting is important for those at high risk of severe COVID-19 even in settings with widespread infection-induced immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring infectious disease outbreaks, humans often base their decision to adhere to an intervention strategy on their personal opinion towards the intervention, perceived risk of infection and intervention effectiveness. However, due to data limitations and inference challenges, infectious disease models usually omit variables that may impact an individuals decision to get vaccinated and their awareness of the interventions effectiveness of disease control within their social contacts as well as the overall population.

MethodsWe constructed a compartmental, deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) disease model that includes a behavioural function with parameters influencing intervention uptake. The behavioural function accounted for an initial subpopulation opinion towards an intervention, their outbreak information sensitivity and the extent they are swayed by the real-time intervention effectiveness information (at a subpopulation- and population-level). Applying the model to vaccination uptake and three human pathogens - pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus - we explored through model simulation how these intervention adherence decision parameters and behavioural heterogeneity in the population impacted epidemiological outcomes.

ResultsFrom our model simulations we found that differences in preference towards outbreak information were pathogen-specific. Therefore, in some pathogen systems, outbreak information types at different outbreak stages may be more informative to an information-sensitive population and lead to less severe epidemic outcomes. In both behaviourally-homogeneous and behaviourally-heterogeneous populations, pandemic influenza showed patterns distinct from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola for cumulative epidemiological metrics of interest. Furthermore, there was notable sensitivity in outbreak size under different assumptions regarding the population split in behavioural traits. Outbreak information preference was sensitive to vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the importance of considering human behaviour during outbreaks in the context of the perceived effectiveness of the intervention.

ImplicationsIncorporating behavioural functions that modify infection control intervention adherence into epidemiological models can aid our understanding of adherence dynamics during outbreaks. Ultimately, by parameterising models with what we know about human behaviour towards vaccination (and other infection control interventions) adherence, such models can help assist decision makers during outbreaks. Such progress will be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases when there is initially little information on the disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 superspreading occurs when transmission is highly efficient and/or an individual infects many others, contributing to rapid spread. To better quantify heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly superspreading, we performed a systematic review of transmission events with data on secondary attack rates or contact tracing of individual index cases published before September 2021, prior to emergence of variants of concern and widespread vaccination. We reviewed 592 distinct events and 9,883 index cases from 491 papers. Meta-analysis of secondary attack rates identified substantial heterogeneity across 12 event types/settings, with the highest transmission (25-35%) in co-living situations including households, nursing homes, and other congregate housing. Among index cases, 67% produced zero secondary cases and only 3% (287) infected &gt;5 secondary cases (&#34;superspreaders&#34;). The highest percentage of superspreaders was among symptomatic individuals, individuals aged 49-64 years, and individuals with over 100 total contacts. However, only 55% of index cases reported age, sex, symptoms, real-time PCR cycle threshold values, or total contacts. Despite the limitations, our review highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading is more likely in settings with prolonged close contact and among symptomatic adults with many contacts. Enhanced reporting on transmission events and contact tracing could help explain heterogeneity and facilitate control efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMalaria remains a major cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs.

MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors.

ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria.

ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.</p>
