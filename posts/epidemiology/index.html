A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1192.6, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nThe impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the likelihood of children identified as sources of infection in the NIH workforce: a cohort study\nAuthors: van Loben Sels, J. M.; Bailin, H. B.; Bell, M. R.; McCormick-Ell, J.; McGann, M.; Das, S.; Roder, A. E.; Ghedin, E.; Castel, A. D.; D. Rebecca, P.; Kwan, J. L.\nScore: 121.8, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23297422\nBackgroundChildren (\u003c18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce. ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (\u003c5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months. ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages. What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces. What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.\nCombining genomic data and infection estimates to characterize the complex dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States\nAuthors: Lopes, R.; Pham, K.; Klaassen, F.; Chitwood, M. H.; Hahn, A.; Redmond, S.; Swartwood, N. A.; Salomon, J. A.; Menzies, N. A.; Cohen, T.; Grubaugh, N. D.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298178\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nAssessing the Impact of Mask Mandates on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission: A Case Study of Utah\nAuthors: Horn, A. C.; Shoemaker, H. E.; Keegan, L. T.\nScore: 26.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298464\nBackground: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates. Methods: Using data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. Results: We found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. Conclusion: Our data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.\nDevice-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity and major cardiovascular events\nAuthors: Stamatakis, E.; Ahmadi, M. N.; Biswas, R. K.; del Pozo Cruz, B.; Thogersen-Ntoumani, C.; Murphy, M.; Sabag, A.; Lear, S.; Gill, J. M.; Chow, C. K.; Hamer, M.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297430\nImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults. ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study. ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes. Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke). ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups. Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.\nOperationalized releases of wAlbB Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti lead to sharp decreases in dengue incidence dependent on Wolbachia frequency\nAuthors: Hoffmann, A. A.; Wasi Ahmad, N.; Wan, M. K.; Cheong, Y. L.; Ahmad, N. A.; Golding, N.; Tierney, N.; Jelip, J.; Wilson Putit, P.; Mokhtar, N.; Singh Sandhu, S.; Lau, S. M.; Khairuddin, K.; Denim, K.; Mohd Rosli, N.; Shahar, H.; Omar, T.; Ridhuan Ghazali, M. K.; Mohd Zabari, N. Z. A.; Abdul Karim, M. A.; Saidin, M. I.; Mohd Nasir, M. N.; Aris, T.; Sinkins, S. P.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298240\nIn Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a replacement strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.\nAncestry diversity in the genetic determinants of the human plasma proteome and associated new drug targets\nAuthors: Said, S.; Pozarickij, A.; Lin, K.; Morris, S.; Kartsonaki, C.; Wright, N.; Fry, H.; Chen, Y.; Du, H.; Bennett, D.; Avery, D.; Schmidt, D. V.; Li, L.; Lv, J.; Yu, C.; Sun, D.; Pei, P.; Chen, J.; Hill, M.; Peto, R.; Collins, R.; Clarke, R.; Millwood, I.; Chen, Z.; Walters, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298365\nThe proteome is fundamental to human biology and disease but little is known about ancestral diversity of its genetic determinants. In GWAS of plasma levels of 1,451 proteins in 3,974 Chinese adults, we identified pQTLs for 1,082 proteins, including 743 with at least one cis-pQTL. Fine-mapping defined credible sets for 3,336 independent pQTLs, of which 31% did not overlap with corresponding analyses in European adults. We assessed 777 sentinel cis-pQTLs in phenome-wide MR analyses using GWAS Catalog and identified Bonferroni-significant associations for 22 protein-disease pairs. Among 10 protein-disease pairs identified from East Asian-specific GWAS, four had evidence of colocalisation. Evaluation of current drug development confirmed indications for one protein target, identified potential repurposing for seven, and discovered nine potential novel targets, including GP2 for Type-2-diabetes. The findings demonstrate the importance of extending genome-wide plasma proteomic analyses to non-European ancestry populations to identify potential novel drug targets for major diseases.\nMonitoring ESBL-Escherichia coli in Swiss wastewater between November 2021 and November 2022: insights into population carriage\nAuthors: Conforti, S.; Holschneider, A.; Sylvestre, E.; Julian, T. R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.12.23298428\nBackground: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, causing millions of deaths annually, with expectations of increased impact in the future. Wastewater surveillance offers a cost-effective, non-invasive tool to understand AMR carriage trends within a population. Aim: We monitored extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) weekly in influent wastewater from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Switzerland (November 2021 to November 2022) to investigate spatio-temporal variations, explore correlations with environmental variables, develop a predictive model for ESBL-E. coli carriage in the community, and detect the most prevalent ESBL-genes. Methods: We cultured total and ESBL-E. coli in 300 wastewater samples to quantify daily loads and percentage of ESBL-E. coli. Additionally, we screened 234 ESBL-E. coli isolates using molecular-methods for the presence of 18 ESBL-gene families. Results: We found a population-weighted mean percentage of ESBL-E. coli of 1.9% (95%CI 1.8%, 2%) across all sites and weeks, which can inform ESBL-E. coli carriage. Concentrations of ESBL-E. coli varied across WWTPs and time, with higher values observed in WWTPs serving larger populations. Recent precipitations (previous 24-/96-hours) showed no significant association with ESBL-E. coli, while temperature occasionally had a moderate impact (p\u003c0.05, correlation coefficients approximately 0.40) in some locations. We identified blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-9 and blaTEM as the predominant ESBL-gene families. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that wastewater-based surveillance of culturable ESBL-E. coli provides insights into AMR trends in Switzerland and may also inform resistance. These findings establish a foundation for long-term, nationally established monitoring protocols and provide information that may help inform targeted public health interventions.\n3-Generation Family Medical Histories of Mental, Neurologic, Cardiometabolic, Birth Defect, Asthma, Allergy, and Autoimmune Conditions Associated with Autism\nAuthors: Schendel, D.; Ejlskov, L.; Overgaard, M.; Jinwala, Z.; Kim, V.; Parner, E.; Kalkbrenner, A.; Ladd-Acosta, C.; Fallin, M. D.; Xie, S.; Mortensen, P. B.; Lee, B.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23298042\nBackgroundFamily histories of different mental and non-mental conditions have often been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the restricted scope of conditions and family members that have been investigated limits etiologic understanding. We aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of ASD associations with 3-generation family histories of 90 mental, neurologic, cardiometabolic, birth defect, asthma, allergy, and autoimmune conditions. The assessment comprised separate estimates of association with ASD overall; separate estimates by sex and intellectual disability (ID) status; as well as separate estimates of the co-occurrence of each of the 90 disorders in autistic persons. Additionally, we aimed to provide interactive catalogues of results to facilitate results visualization and further hypothesis-generation. MethodsWe conducted a population-based, registry cohort study comprised of all live births in Denmark, 1980-2012, of Denmark-born parents, and with birth registry information (1,697,231 births), and their 3-generation family member types (20 types). All cohort members were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for an ASD diagnosis. All participants (cohort members and each family member) were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for each of 90 diagnoses, emigration or death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for ASD overall; by sex; or accounting for ID via separate Cox regression models for each diagnosis-family member type combination, adjusting for birth year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, parental ages at birth, and number of family member types of index person. aHRs were also calculated for sex-specific co-occurrence of each disorder, for ASD overall and considering ID. A catalogue of all results is displayed via interactive heat maps here: https://ncrr-au.shinyapps.io/asd-riskatlas/ and interactive graphic summaries of results are here: https://public.tableau.com/views/ASDPlots_16918786403110/e-Figure5. ResultsIncreased aHRs for ASD (26,840 cases; 1.6% of births) were observed for almost all individual mental disorder-family member type combinations yet for fewer non-mental disorder-family member type combinations. aHRs declined with diminishing degree of relatedness between the index person and family member for some disorders, especially mental disorders. Variation in aHR magnitude by family member sex (e.g., higher maternal than paternal aHRs) or side of the family (e.g., higher maternal versus paternal half sibling aHRs) was more evident among non-mental than mental disorders. Co-occurring ID in the family member or the index person impacted aHR variation. ConclusionOur approach revealed considerable breadth and variation in magnitude of familial health history associations with ASD by type of condition, sex of the affected family member, side of the family, sex of the index person, and ID status which is indicative of diverse genetic, familial, and non-genetic ASD etiologic pathways. More careful attention to identifying sources of autism likelihood encompassed in family medical history, in addition to genetics, may accelerate understanding of factors underlying neurodiversity.\nCollateral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on endocrine treatments for breast and prostate cancer in the UK: implications for bone health\nAuthors: Barclay, N.

Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated across multiple time periods before and after lockdown to examine the impact of changing social restrictions on endocrine treatments and treatment-related outcomes, including osteopenia, osteoporosis and bisphosphonate prescriptions. ResultsIn patients with breast cancer, aromatase inhibitor prescriptions increased during lockdown compared to pre-pandemic (IRR: 1.22 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.11-1.34]), followed by a decrease post-first lockdown (IRR: 0.79 [95%CI: 0.69-0.89]). In patients with prostate cancer, first-generation antiandrogen prescriptions increased compared to pre-pandemic (IRR: 1.23 [95% CI: 1.08-1.4]). For breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors, diagnoses of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bisphosphonate prescriptions were reduced across all lockdown periods compared to pre-pandemic (IRR range: 0.31-0.62). ConclusionDuring the first two years of the pandemic, newly diagnosed breast and prostate cancer patients were prescribed more endocrine treatments compared to pre-pandemic, due to restrictions on hospital procedures replacing surgeries with bridging therapies. But breast cancer patients had fewer diagnoses of osteopenia and osteoporosis, and bisphosphonate prescriptions. These patients should be followed up in the coming years for signs of bone thinning. Evidence of poorer management of treatment-related side-effects will allow us to determine whether there is a need to better allocate resources to patients at high risk for bone-related complications.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChildren (&lt;18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce.

ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (&lt;5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months.

ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages.

What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces.

What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

        <p class="abstract">Background: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates. Methods: Using data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. Results: We found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. Conclusion: Our data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults.

ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study.

ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes.

Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).

ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a  replacement strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The proteome is fundamental to human biology and disease but little is known about ancestral diversity of its genetic determinants. In GWAS of plasma levels of 1,451 proteins in 3,974 Chinese adults, we identified pQTLs for 1,082 proteins, including 743 with at least one cis-pQTL. Fine-mapping defined credible sets for 3,336 independent pQTLs, of which 31% did not overlap with corresponding analyses in European adults. We assessed 777 sentinel cis-pQTLs in phenome-wide MR analyses using GWAS Catalog and identified Bonferroni-significant associations for 22 protein-disease pairs. Among 10 protein-disease pairs identified from East Asian-specific GWAS, four had evidence of colocalisation. Evaluation of current drug development confirmed indications for one protein target, identified potential repurposing for seven, and discovered nine potential novel targets, including GP2 for Type-2-diabetes. The findings demonstrate the importance of extending genome-wide plasma proteomic analyses to non-European ancestry populations to identify potential novel drug targets for major diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, causing millions of deaths annually, with expectations of increased impact in the future. Wastewater surveillance offers a cost-effective, non-invasive tool to understand AMR carriage trends within a population. Aim: We monitored extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli) weekly in influent wastewater from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Switzerland (November 2021 to November 2022) to investigate spatio-temporal variations, explore correlations with environmental variables, develop a predictive model for ESBL-E. coli carriage in the community, and detect the most prevalent ESBL-genes. Methods: We cultured total and ESBL-E. coli in 300 wastewater samples to quantify daily loads and percentage of ESBL-E. coli. Additionally, we screened 234 ESBL-E. coli isolates using molecular-methods for the presence of 18 ESBL-gene families. Results: We found a population-weighted mean percentage of ESBL-E. coli of 1.9% (95%CI 1.8%, 2%) across all sites and weeks, which can inform ESBL-E. coli carriage. Concentrations of ESBL-E. coli varied across WWTPs and time, with higher values observed in WWTPs serving larger populations. Recent precipitations (previous 24-/96-hours) showed no significant association with ESBL-E. coli, while temperature occasionally had a moderate impact (p&lt;0.05, correlation coefficients approximately 0.40) in some locations. We identified blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-9 and blaTEM as the predominant ESBL-gene families. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that wastewater-based surveillance of culturable ESBL-E. coli provides insights into AMR trends in Switzerland and may also inform resistance. These findings establish a foundation for long-term, nationally established monitoring protocols and provide information that may help inform targeted public health interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFamily histories of different mental and non-mental conditions have often been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but the restricted scope of conditions and family members that have been investigated limits etiologic understanding. We aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of ASD associations with 3-generation family histories of 90 mental, neurologic, cardiometabolic, birth defect, asthma, allergy, and autoimmune conditions. The assessment comprised separate estimates of association with ASD overall; separate estimates by sex and intellectual disability (ID) status; as well as separate estimates of the co-occurrence of each of the 90 disorders in autistic persons. Additionally, we aimed to provide interactive catalogues of results to facilitate results visualization and further hypothesis-generation.

MethodsWe conducted a population-based, registry cohort study comprised of all live births in Denmark, 1980-2012, of Denmark-born parents, and with birth registry information (1,697,231 births), and their 3-generation family member types (20 types). All cohort members were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for an ASD diagnosis. All participants (cohort members and each family member) were followed from birth through April 10, 2017 for each of 90 diagnoses, emigration or death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for ASD overall; by sex; or accounting for ID via separate Cox regression models for each diagnosis-family member type combination, adjusting for birth year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, parental ages at birth, and number of family member types of index person. aHRs were also calculated for sex-specific co-occurrence of each disorder, for ASD overall and considering ID. A catalogue of all results is displayed via interactive heat maps here: https://ncrr-au.shinyapps.io/asd-riskatlas/ and interactive graphic summaries of results are here: https://public.tableau.com/views/ASDPlots_16918786403110/e-Figure5.

ResultsIncreased aHRs for ASD (26,840 cases; 1.6% of births) were observed for almost all individual mental disorder-family member type combinations yet for fewer non-mental disorder-family member type combinations. aHRs declined with diminishing degree of relatedness between the index person and family member for some disorders, especially mental disorders. Variation in aHR magnitude by family member sex (e.g., higher maternal than paternal aHRs) or side of the family (e.g., higher maternal versus paternal half sibling aHRs) was more evident among non-mental than mental disorders. Co-occurring ID in the family member or the index person impacted aHR variation.

ConclusionOur approach revealed considerable breadth and variation in magnitude of familial health history associations with ASD by type of condition, sex of the affected family member, side of the family, sex of the index person, and ID status which is indicative of diverse genetic, familial, and non-genetic ASD etiologic pathways. More careful attention to identifying sources of autism likelihood encompassed in family medical history, in addition to genetics, may accelerate understanding of factors underlying neurodiversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic affected cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment pathways. This study examined the impact of the pandemic on incidence and trends of endocrine treatments in patients with breast or prostate cancer; and endocrine treatment-related side-effects.

MethodsPopulation-based cohort study using UK primary care Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database. There were 13,701 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and 12,221 prostate cancer patients with [&amp;ge;]1-year data availability since diagnosis between January 2017-June 2022. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated across multiple time periods before and after lockdown to examine the impact of changing social restrictions on endocrine treatments and treatment-related outcomes, including osteopenia, osteoporosis and bisphosphonate prescriptions.

ResultsIn patients with breast cancer, aromatase inhibitor prescriptions increased during lockdown compared to pre-pandemic (IRR: 1.22 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.11-1.34]), followed by a decrease post-first lockdown (IRR: 0.79 [95%CI: 0.69-0.89]). In patients with prostate cancer, first-generation antiandrogen prescriptions increased compared to pre-pandemic (IRR: 1.23 [95% CI: 1.08-1.4]). For breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors, diagnoses of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bisphosphonate prescriptions were reduced across all lockdown periods compared to pre-pandemic (IRR range: 0.31-0.62).

ConclusionDuring the first two years of the pandemic, newly diagnosed breast and prostate cancer patients were prescribed more endocrine treatments compared to pre-pandemic, due to restrictions on hospital procedures replacing surgeries with bridging therapies. But breast cancer patients had fewer diagnoses of osteopenia and osteoporosis, and bisphosphonate prescriptions. These patients should be followed up in the coming years for signs of bone thinning. Evidence of poorer management of treatment-related side-effects will allow us to determine whether there is a need to better allocate resources to patients at high risk for bone-related complications.</p>
