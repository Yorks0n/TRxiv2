These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation. MethodsWe established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months. Results97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[\u0026le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[\u0026ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [\u0026ge;]1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project. ConclusionsThere was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations [\u0026ge;]1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.\nDeep learning-based prediction of one-year mortality in the entire Finnish population is an accurate but unfair digital marker of aging\nAuthors: Vabalas, A.; Hartonen, T.; Vartiainen, P.; Jukarainen, S.; Viippola, E.; Rodosthenous, R.; Liu, A.; Hagg, S.; Perola, M.; Ganna, A.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.23295726\nBackgroundAccurately predicting short-term mortality is important for optimizing healthcare resource allocation, developing risk-reducing interventions, and improving end-of-life care. Moreover, short-term mortality risk reflects individual frailty and can serve as digital aging marker. Previous studies have focused on specific, high-risk populations. Predicting all-cause mortality in an unselected population incorporating both health and socioeconomic factors has direct public health relevance but requires careful fairness considerations. MethodsWe developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (N = 5.4 million), including \u003e8,000 features and spanning back up to 50 years. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a primary metric to assess model performance and fairness. FindingsThe model achieved an AUC of 0.944 with strong calibration, outperforming a baseline model that only included age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC \u003e 0.800 for 45 out of 50 causes), including COVID-19 which was not present in the training data. The model performed best among young females and worst in older males (AUC = 0.910 vs. AUC = 0.718). Extensive fairness analyses revealed that individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged groups had the worst model performance, not explained by age and sex differences, reduced healthcare contact, or smaller training set sizes within these groups. ConclusionA deep learning model based on nationwide longitudinal multi-modal data accurately identified short-term mortality risk holding the potential for developing a population-wide in-silico aging marker. Unfairness in model predictions represents a major challenge to the equitable integration of these approaches in public health interventions.\nAn explosion of alternative medicines in France! Media-biased polyphonic epidemiology vs. evidence-based data.\nAuthors: Berna, F.; Florens, N.; Verneuil, L.; Paille, F.; Berna, C.; Nizard, J.\nScore: 15.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.23294995\nBackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an \"explosion\" in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly \"boosted\" by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports \"a dramatic uptick\" in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution. This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) \"increases\" or \"explosion\" might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009. MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic. ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an \"explosion\" in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM. ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.\nIs influenza B/Yamagata extinct and what public health implications could this have? An updated literature review and comprehensive assessment of global surveillance databases.\nAuthors: Caini, S.; Meijer, A.; Nunes, M. C.; Henaff, L.; Zounon, M.; Boudewijns, B.; Del Riccio, M.; Paget, J.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23296068\nIntroduction: Early after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information. Methods: We searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide. Results: Highly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation. Discussion: While it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.\nProtocol for the development of a tool (INSPECT-SR) to identify problematic randomised controlled trials in systematic reviews of health interventions.\nAuthors: Wilkinson, J.

A.; Sydenham, E.; Torgerson, D. J.; van Wely, M.; Wang, R.; Bero, L.; Kirkham, J. J.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295626\nIntroduction Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data, and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed, and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions. Methods and analysis The INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.\nPrevalence of Long COVID-associated symptoms in adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany: Results of the population-based study: Corona Monitoring Nationwide 2021/22 (RKI-SOEP-2)\nAuthors: Poethko-Mueller, C.; Ordonez-Cruickshank, A.; Nuebel, J.; Sarganas, G.; Goesswald, A.; Schmid, L.; Schaffrath Rosario, A.; Hoebel, J.; Schlaud, M.; Scheidt-Nave, C.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295426\nBackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to \"Long COVID\" and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge. AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany. MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [\u0026ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection. Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p\u003c0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p\u003c0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p\u003c0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p\u003c0.001). [\u0026ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0). ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.\nInvestigating a causal role for neutrophil count on P. falciparum severe malaria: a Mendelian Randomization study\nAuthors: Constantinescu, A.-E.; Hughes, D. A.; Bull, C. J.; Fleming, K.; Mitchell, R. E.; Zheng, J.; Kar, S. P.; Timpson, N. J.; Amulic, B.; Vincent, E. E.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.23295065\nBackgroundMalaria caused by P. falciparum imposes a tremendous public health burden on people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Severe malaria is associated with high morbidity and mortality and results from complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anaemia or respiratory distress. Individuals living in malaria endemic regions often have a reduced circulating neutrophil count due to a heritable phenomenon called benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN). Neutrophils defend against bacterial infections but have been shown to be detrimental in pre-clinical malaria models, raising the possibility that reduced neutrophil counts modulate severity of malaria in susceptible populations. We tested this hypothesis by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating neutrophil count and a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of neutrophil counts on severe malaria in individuals of predominantly African ancestry. ResultsWe carried out a GWAS of neutrophil count in individuals associated to an African continental ancestry group within UK Biobank (N=5,976). We identified previously unknown loci regulating neutrophil count in a non-European population. This was followed by a two-sample bi-directional MR analysis between neutrophil count and severe malaria (MalariaGEN, N=17,056). We identified 73 loci (r2=0.1) associated with neutrophil count, including the well-known rs2814778 variant responsible for BEN. The greatest evidence for an effect was found between neutrophil count and severe anaemia, although the confidence intervals crossed the null. MR analyses failed to suggest evidence for an effect of the combined severe malaria syndromes or individual subtypes (severe malaria anaemia, cerebral malaria, other severe malaria) on neutrophil count. ConclusionOur GWAS of neutrophil count revealed unique loci present in individuals of African ancestry. We note that a small sample-size reduced our power to identify variants with low allele frequencies and/or low effect sizes in our GWAS. Our work highlights the need for conducting large-scale biobank studies in Africa and for further exploring the link between neutrophils and severe malarial anemia.\nChikungunya intra-vector dynamics in Aedes albopictus from Lyon (France) upon exposure to a human viremia-like dose range reveals vector barrier permissiveness and supports local epidemic potential\nAuthors: Viginier, B.; Cappuccio, L.; Garnier, C.; Martin, E.; Maisse, C.; Valiente Moro, C.; Minard, G.; Fontaine, A.; Lequime, S.; Ratinier, M.; Arnaud, F.; Raquin, V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.06.22281997\nArbovirus emergence and epidemic potential, as approximated by the vectorial capacity formula, depends on host and vector parameters, including the vectors intrinsic ability to replicate then transmit the pathogen known as vector competence. Vector competence is a complex, time dependent, quantitative phenotype influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. A combination of experimental and modelling approaches is required to assess arbovirus intra-vector dynamics and estimate epidemic potential. In this study, we measured infection, dissemination, and transmission dynamics of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a field-derived Aedes albopictus population (Lyon, France) after oral exposure to a range of virus doses spanning human viraemia. Statistical modelling indicates rapid and efficient CHIKV progression in the vector mainly due to an absence of a dissemination barrier, with 100% of the infected mosquitoes ultimately exhibiting a disseminated infection, regardless of the virus dose. Transmission rate data revealed a time-dependent, but overall weak, transmission barrier, with individuals transmitting as soon as 2 days post-exposure (dpe) and =50% infectious mosquitoes at 6 dpe for the highest dose. Based on these experimental intra-vector dynamics data, epidemiological simulations conducted with an agent-based model showed that even at low mosquito biting rates, CHIKV could trigger outbreaks locally. Together, this reveals the epidemic potential of CHIKV upon transmission by Aedes albopictus in mainland France.\nLight at night and modeled circadian disruption predict higher risk of mortality: A prospective study in \u003e88,000 participants\nAuthors: Windred, D. P.; Burns, A. C.; Lane, J. M.; Olivier, P.; Rutter, M. K.; Saxena, R.; Phillips, A. J. K.; Cain, S. W.\nScore: 31.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295231\nImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingUnited Kingdom. ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 57% female. ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{+/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality? FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in \u003e88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk. MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.\nThe social determinants associated with decreased rate of breast cancer screening, delayed presentation, and advanced stage diagnosis of breast cancer: A systematic review\nAuthors: Fekry, M. A.; Yang, J. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295953\nBackgroundThere are many barriers that hinder breast cancer (BC) early detection such as social, demographic, and economic factors. We examined the barriers to early detection. MethodsPubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were chosen to conduct a comprehensive literature search. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to select the relevant studies on decreased rate of BC screening, delayed presentation of BC, and advanced stage diagnosis of BC. ResultsThe literature demonstrates that several determinants had a significant impact on the delay in seeking medical help, rate of performing breast cancer screening (BCS), and stage at diagnosis of BC. Younger age, rural residence, being non-white, being single, low socioeconomic status, absence of medical insurance, having no paid job, low educational level, positive family history of BC, and having TNBC or HER2E BC subtypes were significantly associated with presenting at advanced stages, decreased rate of BCS, and delayed presentation. Meanwhile, the associations between BC and BMI, parity, religion, and menopausal status were underexamined in the literature. ConclusionPromoting early detection of BC should be taking the sociodemographic disparities into consideration. To address these disparities, raising public awareness, implementing universal health coverage (UHC), and increasing government expenditure on health and education are needed, especially among vulnerable societies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThis study examined the correlation of classroom ventilation (air exchanges per hour (ACH)) and exposure to CO2 [&amp;ge;]1,000 ppm with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over a 20-month period in a specialized school for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS-CoV-2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures (e.g. masking). One in-school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools is increased ventilation.

MethodsWe established a community-engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD. Ambient CO2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms, and air changes per hour (ACH) were calculated. The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months.

Results97% of rooms had an estimated ACH[&amp;le;] 4.0, with 7% having CO2 levels[&amp;ge;] 2,000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day. A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO2 levels [&amp;ge;]1,000 ppm and SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests normalized to room occupancy, accounting for 43% of the variance. No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per-room SARS-CoV-2 cases. Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV-13 filters had lower SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR counts. These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community-engaged research project.

ConclusionsThere was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO2 concentrations [&amp;ge;]1,000 and SARS-CoV-2 cases in an IDD school. Merv-13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research partnership identified areas for improving in-school ventilation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAccurately predicting short-term mortality is important for optimizing healthcare resource allocation, developing risk-reducing interventions, and improving end-of-life care. Moreover, short-term mortality risk reflects individual frailty and can serve as digital aging marker. Previous studies have focused on specific, high-risk populations. Predicting all-cause mortality in an unselected population incorporating both health and socioeconomic factors has direct public health relevance but requires careful fairness considerations.

MethodsWe developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (N = 5.4 million), including &gt;8,000 features and spanning back up to 50 years. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a primary metric to assess model performance and fairness.

FindingsThe model achieved an AUC of 0.944 with strong calibration, outperforming a baseline model that only included age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC &gt; 0.800 for 45 out of 50 causes), including COVID-19 which was not present in the training data. The model performed best among young females and worst in older males (AUC = 0.910 vs. AUC = 0.718). Extensive fairness analyses revealed that individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged groups had the worst model performance, not explained by age and sex differences, reduced healthcare contact, or smaller training set sizes within these groups.

ConclusionA deep learning model based on nationwide longitudinal multi-modal data accurately identified short-term mortality risk holding the potential for developing a population-wide in-silico aging marker. Unfairness in model predictions represents a major challenge to the equitable integration of these approaches in public health interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe media and several French official organizations report an &#34;explosion&#34; in the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in France, possibly &#34;boosted&#34; by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the French Miviludes (Mission of Vigilance and Fight Against Sectarian Aberrations) routinely asserts in its yearly reports &#34;a dramatic uptick&#34; in sectarian aberrations in the health sector. However, data supporting those assertions are either scant or rarely compared with data from previous years to properly apprehend an evolution.

This paper aims to analyze existing data in this field and to examine in which domain (population-based survey, official reports, media) &#34;increases&#34; or &#34;explosion&#34; might be observed. We compared the data from France and Switzerland. In fact, no clear regulatory policy on CAM exists in France, whereas the Swiss population voted to include CAM into the Swiss Constitution in 2009.

MethodSurveys documenting the reported usage of CAM in both France and Switzerland were analyzed. Health-related sectarian aberrations were analyzed based on yearly reports of the French Miviludes and its Swiss counterpart (Inter-Cantonal Information Center on Beliefs). Then, the communication in the media on CAM was analyzed in the French media and in the scientific literature published in both countries. Three time periods were considered to apprehend the claimed boost of the Covid-19 pandemic.

ResultsOur comprehensive analysis of available information sources does not suggest an &#34;explosion&#34; in CAM use or related sectarian misconduct. Reported CAM use in France was 39% in 2007 and later surveys did not find higher percentage. Reported CAM use increased from 24% to 28.9% between 2007 and 2017 in Switzerland. Referrals about health-related sectarian aberrations regularly increased until 2017 and then remained stable in France; they regularly decreased in Switzerland. Evidence for a pandemic boost was weak. In contrast, a steady increase was observed in the number of mentions in media of CAM.

ConclusionOur analyses indicate a media-skewed, polyphonic epidemiology, which is not supported by available data. Health care specialists, Official organizations, journalists and politicians should become aware of biases concerning CAM and foster a more informed and balanced discourse regarding these practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Early after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information. Methods: We searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide. Results: Highly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation. Discussion: While it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data, and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed, and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions. Methods and analysis The INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundControlled population-based studies on long-term health sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify clinical signs specific to &#34;Long COVID&#34; and to evaluate this emerging public health challenge.

AimTo examine prevalence differences of Long COVID-associated symptoms among adults with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany.

MethodsThis population-based, retrospective study (11/2021-2/2022) included 7,683 working aged adults (18-65 years), a subset of the Corona Monitoring Nationwide study in Germany. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined based on self-reported PCR-confirmed infections and IgG-antibody dried blood spot testing. Participants answered a questionnaire including 19 common symptoms of Long COVID experienced in the six months preceding the survey. We estimated population-weighted prevalence of (1) individual symptoms, and (2) [&amp;ge;]1 symptom, with and without impact on work ability, by infection status within strata of sex, age group, income and comorbidity. We calculated model-adjusted prevalence differences and the probability that symptoms among infected are attributable to infection.

Results12 of 19 symptoms showed a significantly higher prevalence in infected than non-infected participants, including fatigue (27.5% versus 18.3%; p&lt;0.001), concentration problems (22.2% vs. 13.1%; p&lt;0.001), shortness of breath (15.6% vs. 7.5%; p&lt;0.001), and smell and taste disorder (10% vs. 1.2%; p&lt;0.001). [&amp;ge;]1 symptom with impact on work ability was more prevalent following infection (16.0% vs. 12.2%; p=0.06) with a model-adjusted prevalence difference of 3.8% (95%-CI -0.5-8.0).

ConclusionWe observed a rather small excess prevalence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the absolute number of persons places great demands on the health care system and may affect economic productivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMalaria caused by P. falciparum imposes a tremendous public health burden on people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Severe malaria is associated with high morbidity and mortality and results from complications such as cerebral malaria, severe anaemia or respiratory distress. Individuals living in malaria endemic regions often have a reduced circulating neutrophil count due to a heritable phenomenon called  benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN). Neutrophils defend against bacterial infections but have been shown to be detrimental in pre-clinical malaria models, raising the possibility that reduced neutrophil counts modulate severity of malaria in susceptible populations. We tested this hypothesis by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating neutrophil count and a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of neutrophil counts on severe malaria in individuals of predominantly African ancestry.

ResultsWe carried out a GWAS of neutrophil count in individuals associated to an African continental ancestry group within UK Biobank (N=5,976). We identified previously unknown loci regulating neutrophil count in a non-European population. This was followed by a two-sample bi-directional MR analysis between neutrophil count and severe malaria (MalariaGEN, N=17,056). We identified 73 loci (r2=0.1) associated with neutrophil count, including the well-known rs2814778 variant responsible for BEN. The greatest evidence for an effect was found between neutrophil count and severe anaemia, although the confidence intervals crossed the null. MR analyses failed to suggest evidence for an effect of the combined severe malaria syndromes or individual subtypes (severe malaria anaemia, cerebral malaria, other severe malaria) on neutrophil count.

ConclusionOur GWAS of neutrophil count revealed unique loci present in individuals of African ancestry. We note that a small sample-size reduced our power to identify variants with low allele frequencies and/or low effect sizes in our GWAS. Our work highlights the need for conducting large-scale biobank studies in Africa and for further exploring the link between neutrophils and severe malarial anemia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Arbovirus emergence and epidemic potential, as approximated by the vectorial capacity formula, depends on host and vector parameters, including the vectors intrinsic ability to replicate then transmit the pathogen known as vector competence. Vector competence is a complex, time dependent, quantitative phenotype influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. A combination of experimental and modelling approaches is required to assess arbovirus intra-vector dynamics and estimate epidemic potential. In this study, we measured infection, dissemination, and transmission dynamics of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a field-derived Aedes albopictus population (Lyon, France) after oral exposure to a range of virus doses spanning human viraemia. Statistical modelling indicates rapid and efficient CHIKV progression in the vector mainly due to an absence of a dissemination barrier, with 100% of the infected mosquitoes ultimately exhibiting a disseminated infection, regardless of the virus dose. Transmission rate data revealed a time-dependent, but overall weak, transmission barrier, with individuals transmitting as soon as 2 days post-exposure (dpe) and =50% infectious mosquitoes at 6 dpe for the highest dose. Based on these experimental intra-vector dynamics data, epidemiological simulations conducted with an agent-based model showed that even at low mosquito biting rates, CHIKV could trigger outbreaks locally. Together, this reveals the epidemic potential of CHIKV upon transmission by Aedes albopictus in mainland France.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established.

ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{&#43;/-}7.8 years, 57% female.

ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data.

Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({&#43;/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{&#43;/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking.

ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality?

FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in &gt;88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk.

MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere are many barriers that hinder breast cancer (BC) early detection such as social, demographic, and economic factors. We examined the barriers to early detection.

MethodsPubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were chosen to conduct a comprehensive literature search. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was used to select the relevant studies on decreased rate of BC screening, delayed presentation of BC, and advanced stage diagnosis of BC.

ResultsThe literature demonstrates that several determinants had a significant impact on the delay in seeking medical help, rate of performing breast cancer screening (BCS), and stage at diagnosis of BC. Younger age, rural residence, being non-white, being single, low socioeconomic status, absence of medical insurance, having no paid job, low educational level, positive family history of BC, and having TNBC or HER2E BC subtypes were significantly associated with presenting at advanced stages, decreased rate of BCS, and delayed presentation. Meanwhile, the associations between BC and BMI, parity, religion, and menopausal status were underexamined in the literature.

ConclusionPromoting early detection of BC should be taking the sociodemographic disparities into consideration. To address these disparities, raising public awareness, implementing universal health coverage (UHC), and increasing government expenditure on health and education are needed, especially among vulnerable societies.</p>
