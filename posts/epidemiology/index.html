M.; Boas, H.; Dahl, J.; Viksmoen Watle, S.; Berild, J. D.; Greve-Isdahl, M.; Stoerdal, K.; Gulseth, H.; Karlstad, O.; Lopez-Doriga Ruiz, P.; Tapia, G.\nScore: 809.1, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299926\nBackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.\nBNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted Vaccine and COVID-19 Hospital Admissions and Ambulatory Visits in US Adults\nAuthors: Tartof, S. Y.; Slezak, J. M.; Frankland, T. B.; Puzniak, L.; Hong, V.; Ackerson, B. K.; Stern, J. A.; Simmons, S.; Jodar, L.; McLaughlin, J. M.\nScore: 2211.9, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300512\nImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited. ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits. ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. KEY POINTS QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated? FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.\nLong COVID Disability Burden in US Adults: YLDs and NIH Funding Relative to Other Conditions\nAuthors: Bonuck, K.; Gao, Q.; Congdon, S.; Kim, R.\nScore: 121.1, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301057\nBackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex. MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions. FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (\u003c1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition. InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden. Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords \"years lived with disability\" + \"COVID\" yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced \"disability-adjusted life years\" (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, \"disease burden\" + Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact. We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions. Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at \u003c1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was \u003e= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions. Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.\nQuantifying the impact of social activities on SARS-CoV-2 transmission using Google mobility reports\nAuthors: Günther, F.; Brustad, H. K.; Frigessi, A.; Britton, T.\nScore: 49.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300755\nWe developed a state-space model to investigate which social behaviours had biggest impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The analyses were based on reported hospitalizations, together with information on vaccinations, weather data, virus strains and, most importantly, Google mobility reports on 4 different types of social activities. While our new approach is general, we studied Sweden and Norway on a regional level over 75 weeks, and the major regions of Berlin and Bavaria in Germany over 10 months. Most results are shared for all three countries: Activity in four social settings explain between 40-60% of all infections; Public transport appears as an important setting for infections in all countries; and the transmission potential drops by 40-50% during the summer as compared to the winter peak. However, the analyses for Germany differ in that Retail and recreation is the other setting dominating transmission whereas it is contacts at the Workplace in Norway and Sweden, showing how our model is able to adapt to specific cases. Transmissions not captured by the Google data may happen in other settings, in particular in households. The statistical model has a deterministic time and region specific transmission rate with an additive component for the four Google settings, and a multiplicative part taking seasonality and circulating virus strains into account. Inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using Stan.\nRelationship between alcohol consumption and dementia with Mendelian randomization approaches among older adults in the United States\nAuthors: Campbell, K. A.; Fu, M.; MacDonald, E.; Zawistowski, M.; Bakulski, K. M.; Ware, E. B.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300298\nBackgroundIn observational studies, the association between alcohol consumption and dementia is mixed. MethodsWe performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of weekly alcohol consumption and late-onset Alzheimers disease and one-sample MR in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), wave 2012. Inverse variance weighted two-stage regression provided odds ratios of association between alcohol exposure and dementia or cognitively impaired, non-dementia relative to cognitively normal. ResultsAlcohol consumption was not associated with late-onset Alzheimers disease using two-sample MR (OR=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI):[0.78, 1.72]). In HRS, doubling weekly alcohol consumption was not associated with dementia (African ancestries, n=1,322, OR=1.00, 95% CI [0.45, 2.25]; European ancestries, n=7,160, OR=1.37, 95% CI [0.53, 3.51]) or cognitively impaired, non-dementia (African ancestries, n=1,322, OR=1.17, 95% CI [0.69, 1.98]; European ancestries, n=7,160, OR=0.75, 95% CI [0.47, 1.22]). ConclusionAlcohol consumption was not associated with cognitively impaired, non-dementia or dementia status.\nNowcasting Reported COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using De-Identified, Aggregated Medical Insurance Claims Data\nAuthors: Shen, X.; Rumack, A.; Wilder, B.; Tibshirani, R. J.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300471\nWe propose, implement, and evaluate a method for nowcasting the daily number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, at the level of individual US states, based on de-identified, aggregated medical insurance claims data. Our analysis proceeds under a hypothetical scenario in which, during the Delta wave, states only report data on the first day of each month, and on this day, report COVID-19 hospitalization counts for each day in the previous month. In this hypothetical scenario (just as in reality), medical insurance claims data continues to be available daily. At the beginning of each month, we train a regression model, using all data available thus far, to predict hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims. We then use this model to nowcast the (unseen) values of COVID-19 hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims, at each day in the following month. Our analysis uses properly-versioned data, which would have been available in real-time, at the time predictions are produced. In spite of the difficulties inherent to real-time estimation (e.g., latency and backfill) and the complex dynamics behind COVID-19 hospitalizations themselves, we find overall that medical insurance claims can be an accurate predictor of hospitalization reports, with mean absolute errors typically around 0.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, i.e., proportion of variance explained around 75%. Perhaps more importantly, we find that nowcasts made using medical insurance claims can qualitatively capture the dynamics (upswings and downswings) of hospitalization waves, which are key features that inform public health decision-making.\nAttribution of invasive group A streptococcal infections to varicella and respiratory virus circulation, the Netherlands, 2010-2023\nAuthors: de Gier, B.; van de Kassteele, J.; van Asten, L.; Schoffelen, A. F.; ISIS-AR Study Group, ; Hooiveld, M.; te Wierik, M. J. M.; van Sorge, N. M.; de Melker, H. E.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24300975\nBackgroundAfter the lifting of most COVID-19 control measures, many infectious diseases re-emerged in 2022. A strong increase in invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections, among both adults and young children, was reported by several countries. Viral infections such as influenza and varicella, known risk factors for iGAS infection, also increased during 2022. We estimated the proportion of GAS skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in children aged 0-5 years attributable to varicella, and the proportion of GAS pneumonia/sepsis in children aged 0-5 and adults attributable to respiratory viruses in the Netherlands. MethodsWe performed time-series regression using weekly data on influenza A and B, RSV, hMPV and SARS-CoV-2, varicella and non-invasive GAS infections, and GAS isolates cultured from blood, lower airways, skin, pus and wounds, from January 2010 to March 2023. ResultsUp to 2022, approximately 50%(95%CI 36-64%) of GAS SSTI in children were attributable to varicella. Between January 2022 and March 2023, 34%(95%CI 24-43%) of GAS SSTI cases were attributable to varicella. Of iGAS pneumonia/sepsis between January 2022 and March 2023, 25%(95%CI 18-31%) and 37%(95% CI 23-53%) was attributable to respiratory virus infections in adults and children, respectively, with the largest contributor being influenza A. ConclusionsVaricella and respiratory virus infections likely contributed to, but only partly explain, the observed iGAS increase among children and adults in 2022-2023 in the Netherlands. Public health measures to control viral infections, such as vaccination against varicella or influenza, might reduce the iGAS disease burden but will not suffice to curb the current high incidence.\nSymptom propagation in respiratory pathogens of public health concern: a review of the evidence\nAuthors: Asplin, P.; Mancy, R.; Finnie, T.; Cumming, F.; Keeling, M. J.; Hill, E. M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.24300898\nSymptom propagation occurs when the symptom set an individual experiences is correlated with the symptom set of the individual who infected them. Symptom propagation may dramatically affect epidemiological outcomes, potentially causing clusters of severe disease. Conversely, it could result in chains of mild infection, generating widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Despite accumulating evidence that symptom propagation occurs for many respiratory pathogens, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we conducted a scoping literature review for 14 respiratory pathogens to ascertain the extent of evidence for symptom propagation by two mechanisms: dose-severity relationships and route-severity relationships. We identify considerable heterogeneity between pathogens in the relative importance of the two mechanisms, highlighting the importance of pathogen-specific investigations. For almost all pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we found support for at least one of the two mechanisms. For some pathogens, including influenza, we found convincing evidence that both mechanisms contribute to symptom propagation. Furthermore, infectious disease models traditionally do not include symptom propagation. We summarise the present state of modelling advancements to address the methodological gap. We then investigate a simplified disease outbreak scenario, finding that under strong symptom propagation, quarantining mildly infected individuals can have negative epidemiological implications.\nAssessing the impact of interventions on the major Omicron BA.2 outbreak in spring 2022 in Shanghai\nAuthors: Liu, H.; Cai, J.; Zhou, J.; Xu, X.; Ajelli, M.; Yu, H.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.24300974\nBackgroundShanghai experienced a significant surge in Omicron BA.2 infections from March to June 2022. In addition to the standard interventions in place at that time, additional interventions were implemented in response to the outbreak. However, the impact of these interventions on BA.2 transmission remains unclear. MethodsWe systematically collected data on the daily number of newly reported infections during this wave and utilized a Bayesian approach to estimate the daily effective reproduction number. Data on public health responses were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and served as a proxy for the interventions implemented during this outbreak. Using a log-linear regression model, we assessed the impact of these interventions on the reproduction number. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of BA.2 transmission. By combining the estimated effect of the interventions from the regression model and the transmission model, we estimated the number of infections and deaths averted by the implemented interventions. ResultsWe found a negative association (-0.0069, 95% CI: -0.0096 to -0.0045) between the level of interventions and the number of infections. If interventions did not ramp up during the outbreak, we estimated that the number of infections and deaths would have increased by 22.6% (95% CI: 22.4-22.8%), leading to a total of 768,576 (95% CI: 768,021-769,107) infections and 722 (95% CI: 722-723) deaths. If no interventions were deployed during the outbreak, we estimated that the number of infections and deaths would have increased by 46.0% (95% CI: 45.8-46.2%), leading to a total of 915,099 (95% CI: 914,639-915,518) infections and 860 (95% CI: 860-861) deaths. ConclusionOur findings suggest that the interventions adopted during the Omicron BA.2 outbreak in spring 2022 in Shanghai were effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease burden. Our findings emphasize the importance of non-pharmacological interventions in controlling quick surges of cases during epidemic outbreaks.\nThe relationship between antibiotic use in humans and poultry and antibiotic resistance prevalence in humans: an ecological regression study of Campylobacter in the UK\nAuthors: Emes, E.; Guitian, J.; Knight, G. M.; Naylor, N.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301092\nAntibiotic resistance (ABR), the capacity of bacterial pathogens to survive in the presence of antibiotics, is an increasingly pressing issue for human health worldwide. The use of antibiotics (ABU) in humans and livestock animals, is considered the main driver of the global increase in ABR prevalence, but the shape and size of this relationship at the population level is still uncertain. In the UK, the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter is a major cause of foodborne infection, with most infections attributed to poultry. It is a strong case study to investigate the ecological relationship between antibiotic use and resistance across humans and animals. Despite significant reductions in ABU in humans and poultry over the last decade, the rate of ABR in Campylobacter infections in the UK has remained relatively high. We compiled data on Campylobacter infections and the use of antibiotics in primary care, secondary care, and poultry health in the UK from 2011 to 2022 (human data were from England only). Using pooled ordinary least squares regression, we investigated the relationship between the rate of ABR in Campylobacter infections and the quantity of ABU in each of these three sectors. We also explored the shape and size of this relationship using different specifications. Our results suggest that the rate of antibiotic resistance in human Campylobacter infections in the UK was positively linked with use of antibiotics in humans, with some evidence that it was also linked to antibiotic use in poultry. However, antibiotic use explained only a relatively small portion of the changes in resistance. For human health, we found evidence that the relationship between (antibiotic) use and resistance weakens over time as resistance builds up in the human population, supporting the idea of a resistance threshold beyond which resistant strains become endemic and reductions in use become less effective. Our results suggest that reducing use alone may not be sufficient to bring the level of ABR in Campylobacter down to desirable levels. While antibiotic stewardship remains essential, future policy and research on Campylobacter should dedicate focus to transmission factors, safeguarding new antibiotics in people, and alternative and complementary therapies for poultry infection such as vaccination and bacteriophages.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway.

Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows.

ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression.

ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited.

ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits.

ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

KEY POINTS

QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated?

FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex.

MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions.

FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (&lt;1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition.

InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden.

Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords &#34;years lived with disability&#34; &#43; &#34;COVID&#34; yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced &#34;disability-adjusted life years&#34; (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, &#34;disease burden&#34; &#43; Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact.

We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions.

Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at &lt;1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was &gt;= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions.

Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We developed a state-space model to investigate which social behaviours had biggest impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The analyses were based on reported hospitalizations, together with information on vaccinations, weather data, virus strains and, most importantly, Google mobility reports on 4 different types of social activities. While our new approach is general, we studied Sweden and Norway on a regional level over 75 weeks, and the major regions of Berlin and Bavaria in Germany over 10 months. Most results are shared for all three countries: Activity in four social settings explain between 40-60% of all infections; Public transport appears as an important setting for infections in all countries; and the transmission potential drops by 40-50% during the summer as compared to the winter peak. However, the analyses for Germany differ in that Retail and recreation is the other setting dominating transmission whereas it is contacts at the Workplace in Norway and Sweden, showing how our model is able to adapt to specific cases. Transmissions not captured by the Google data may happen in other settings, in particular in households. The statistical model has a deterministic time and region specific transmission rate with an additive component for the four Google settings, and a multiplicative part taking seasonality and circulating virus strains into account. Inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using Stan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn observational studies, the association between alcohol consumption and dementia is mixed.

MethodsWe performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of weekly alcohol consumption and late-onset Alzheimers disease and one-sample MR in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), wave 2012. Inverse variance weighted two-stage regression provided odds ratios of association between alcohol exposure and dementia or cognitively impaired, non-dementia relative to cognitively normal.

ResultsAlcohol consumption was not associated with late-onset Alzheimers disease using two-sample MR (OR=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI):[0.78, 1.72]). In HRS, doubling weekly alcohol consumption was not associated with dementia (African ancestries, n=1,322, OR=1.00, 95% CI [0.45, 2.25]; European ancestries, n=7,160, OR=1.37, 95% CI [0.53, 3.51]) or cognitively impaired, non-dementia (African ancestries, n=1,322, OR=1.17, 95% CI [0.69, 1.98]; European ancestries, n=7,160, OR=0.75, 95% CI [0.47, 1.22]).

ConclusionAlcohol consumption was not associated with cognitively impaired, non-dementia or dementia status.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We propose, implement, and evaluate a method for nowcasting the daily number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, at the level of individual US states, based on de-identified, aggregated medical insurance claims data. Our analysis proceeds under a hypothetical scenario in which, during the Delta wave, states only report data on the first day of each month, and on this day, report COVID-19 hospitalization counts for each day in the previous month. In this hypothetical scenario (just as in reality), medical insurance claims data continues to be available daily. At the beginning of each month, we train a regression model, using all data available thus far, to predict hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims. We then use this model to nowcast the (unseen) values of COVID-19 hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims, at each day in the following month. Our analysis uses properly-versioned data, which would have been available in real-time, at the time predictions are produced. In spite of the difficulties inherent to real-time estimation (e.g., latency and backfill) and the complex dynamics behind COVID-19 hospitalizations themselves, we find overall that medical insurance claims can be an accurate predictor of hospitalization reports, with mean absolute errors typically around 0.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, i.e., proportion of variance explained around 75%. Perhaps more importantly, we find that nowcasts made using medical insurance claims can qualitatively capture the dynamics (upswings and downswings) of hospitalization waves, which are key features that inform public health decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAfter the lifting of most COVID-19 control measures, many infectious diseases re-emerged in 2022. A strong increase in invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infections, among both adults and young children, was reported by several countries. Viral infections such as influenza and varicella, known risk factors for iGAS infection, also increased during 2022. We estimated the proportion of GAS skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in children aged 0-5 years attributable to varicella, and the proportion of GAS pneumonia/sepsis in children aged 0-5 and adults attributable to respiratory viruses in the Netherlands.

MethodsWe performed time-series regression using weekly data on influenza A and B, RSV, hMPV and SARS-CoV-2, varicella and non-invasive GAS infections, and GAS isolates cultured from blood, lower airways, skin, pus and wounds, from January 2010 to March 2023.

ResultsUp to 2022, approximately 50%(95%CI 36-64%) of GAS SSTI in children were attributable to varicella. Between January 2022 and March 2023, 34%(95%CI 24-43%) of GAS SSTI cases were attributable to varicella. Of iGAS pneumonia/sepsis between January 2022 and March 2023, 25%(95%CI 18-31%) and 37%(95% CI 23-53%) was attributable to respiratory virus infections in adults and children, respectively, with the largest contributor being influenza A.

ConclusionsVaricella and respiratory virus infections likely contributed to, but only partly explain, the observed iGAS increase among children and adults in 2022-2023 in the Netherlands. Public health measures to control viral infections, such as vaccination against varicella or influenza, might reduce the iGAS disease burden but will not suffice to curb the current high incidence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Symptom propagation occurs when the symptom set an individual experiences is correlated with the symptom set of the individual who infected them. Symptom propagation may dramatically affect epidemiological outcomes, potentially causing clusters of severe disease. Conversely, it could result in chains of mild infection, generating widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health.

Despite accumulating evidence that symptom propagation occurs for many respiratory pathogens, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we conducted a scoping literature review for 14 respiratory pathogens to ascertain the extent of evidence for symptom propagation by two mechanisms: dose-severity relationships and route-severity relationships.

We identify considerable heterogeneity between pathogens in the relative importance of the two mechanisms, highlighting the importance of pathogen-specific investigations. For almost all pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, we found support for at least one of the two mechanisms. For some pathogens, including influenza, we found convincing evidence that both mechanisms contribute to symptom propagation.

Furthermore, infectious disease models traditionally do not include symptom propagation. We summarise the present state of modelling advancements to address the methodological gap. We then investigate a simplified disease outbreak scenario, finding that under strong symptom propagation, quarantining mildly infected individuals can have negative epidemiological implications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundShanghai experienced a significant surge in Omicron BA.2 infections from March to June 2022. In addition to the standard interventions in place at that time, additional interventions were implemented in response to the outbreak. However, the impact of these interventions on BA.2 transmission remains unclear.

MethodsWe systematically collected data on the daily number of newly reported infections during this wave and utilized a Bayesian approach to estimate the daily effective reproduction number. Data on public health responses were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and served as a proxy for the interventions implemented during this outbreak. Using a log-linear regression model, we assessed the impact of these interventions on the reproduction number. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of BA.2 transmission. By combining the estimated effect of the interventions from the regression model and the transmission model, we estimated the number of infections and deaths averted by the implemented interventions.

ResultsWe found a negative association (-0.0069, 95% CI: -0.0096 to -0.0045) between the level of interventions and the number of infections. If interventions did not ramp up during the outbreak, we estimated that the number of infections and deaths would have increased by 22.6% (95% CI: 22.4-22.8%), leading to a total of 768,576 (95% CI: 768,021-769,107) infections and 722 (95% CI: 722-723) deaths. If no interventions were deployed during the outbreak, we estimated that the number of infections and deaths would have increased by 46.0% (95% CI: 45.8-46.2%), leading to a total of 915,099 (95% CI: 914,639-915,518) infections and 860 (95% CI: 860-861) deaths.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that the interventions adopted during the Omicron BA.2 outbreak in spring 2022 in Shanghai were effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease burden. Our findings emphasize the importance of non-pharmacological interventions in controlling quick surges of cases during epidemic outbreaks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antibiotic resistance (ABR), the capacity of bacterial pathogens to survive in the presence of antibiotics, is an increasingly pressing issue for human health worldwide. The use of antibiotics (ABU) in humans and livestock animals, is considered the main driver of the global increase in ABR prevalence, but the shape and size of this relationship at the population level is still uncertain.

In the UK, the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter is a major cause of foodborne infection, with most infections attributed to poultry. It is a strong case study to investigate the ecological relationship between antibiotic use and resistance across humans and animals. Despite significant reductions in ABU in humans and poultry over the last decade, the rate of ABR in Campylobacter infections in the UK has remained relatively high.

We compiled data on Campylobacter infections and the use of antibiotics in primary care, secondary care, and poultry health in the UK from 2011 to 2022 (human data were from England only). Using pooled ordinary least squares regression, we investigated the relationship between the rate of ABR in Campylobacter infections and the quantity of ABU in each of these three sectors. We also explored the shape and size of this relationship using different specifications.

Our results suggest that the rate of antibiotic resistance in human Campylobacter infections in the UK was positively linked with use of antibiotics in humans, with some evidence that it was also linked to antibiotic use in poultry. However, antibiotic use explained only a relatively small portion of the changes in resistance. For human health, we found evidence that the relationship between (antibiotic) use and resistance weakens over time as resistance builds up in the human population, supporting the idea of a resistance threshold beyond which resistant strains become endemic and reductions in use become less effective.

Our results suggest that reducing use alone may not be sufficient to bring the level of ABR in Campylobacter down to desirable levels. While antibiotic stewardship remains essential, future policy and research on Campylobacter should dedicate focus to transmission factors, safeguarding new antibiotics in people, and alternative and complementary therapies for poultry infection such as vaccination and bacteriophages.</p>
