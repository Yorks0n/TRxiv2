A.; Anderson, S. A.\nScore: 970.9, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [\u0026ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [\u0026ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).\nAssessing the causal effect of air pollution on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nAuthors: Navaratnam, A. M. D.; Beale, S.; Boukari, Y.; Nguyen, V.; Fong, W. L. E.; Braithwaite, I.; Byrne, T. E.; Fragaszy, E.; Geismar, C.; Kovar, J.; Patel, P.; Shrotri, M.; Yavlinsky, A.; Hayward, A.; Khreis, H.; Aldridge, R. W.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297598\nIntroduction Emerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations. Methods Concentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects. Results Single pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data. Conclusion Long term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.\nAssociation between common adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations in a population-based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands\nAuthors: Holwerda, M. R.; Hoeve, C. E.; Huiberts, A. J.; den Hartog, G.; de Melker, H. E.; van den Hof, S.; Knol, M.\nScore: 148.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297194\nINTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations. METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination. RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (\u003c60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54). CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.\nCovid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, a nested case-control study in births from April 2021 to March 2022, England\nAuthors: Mensah, A. A.; Stowe, J.; Jardine, J. E.; Kirsebom, F. C.; Clare, T.; Kall, M.; Campbell, H.; Lopez-Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.\nScore: 36.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296737\nIntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception. Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes. What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants. What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer. How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.\nInferring Viral Transmission Pathways from Within-Host Variation\nAuthors: Specht, I. O. A.; Petros, B. A.; Moreno, G. K.; Brock-Fisher, T.; Krasilnikova, L. A.; Schifferli, M.; Yang, K.; Cronan, P.; Glennon, O.; Schaffner, S. F.; Park, D. J.; MacInnis, B. L.; Ozonoff, A.; Fry, B.; Mitzenmacher, M. D.; Varilly, P.; Sabeti, P. C.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.23297039\nGenome sequencing can offer critical insight into pathogen spread in viral outbreaks, but existing transmission inference methods use simplistic evolutionary models and only incorporate a portion of available genetic data. Here, we develop a robust evolutionary model for transmission reconstruction that tracks the genetic composition of within-host viral populations over time and the lineages transmitted between hosts. We confirm that our model reliably describes within-host variant frequencies in a dataset of 134,682 SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequenced genomes from Massachusetts, USA. We then demonstrate that our reconstruction approach infers transmissions more accurately than two leading methods on synthetic data, as well as in a controlled outbreak of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and an epidemiologically-investigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in South Africa. Finally, we apply our transmission reconstruction tool to 5,692 outbreaks among the 134,682 Massachusetts genomes. Our methods and results demonstrate the utility of within-host variation for transmission inference of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and provide an adaptable mathematical framework for tracking within-host evolution.\nDid long COVID increase road deaths in the U.S.?\nAuthors: Robertson, L. S.\nScore: 359.1, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296868\nObjectiveTo examine data on COVID-19 disease associated with a 10 percent increase in U.S. road deaths from 2020 to 2021 that raises the question of the potential effect of pandemic stress and neurological damage from COVID-19 disease. MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020. ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices. ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with \"long COVID\" to minimize road use. What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations. What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with \"long covid\" about road risk is warranted.\nEstimated transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants from wastewater are robust to differential shedding\nAuthors: Dreifuss, D.; Huisman, J. S.; Rusch, J. C.; Caduff, L.; Ganesanandamoorthy, P.; Devaux, A. J.; Gan, C.; Stadler, T.; Kohn, T.; Ort, C.; Beerenwinkel, N.; Julian, T. R.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297539\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater samples can provide genomic information for detecting and assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in communities and for estimating important epidemiological parameters such as the growth advantage of the variant. However, despite demonstrated successes, epidemiological data derived from wastewater suffers from potential biases. Of particular concern are differential shedding profiles that different variants of concern exhibit, because they can shift the relationship between viral loads in wastewater and prevalence estimates derived from clinical cases. Using mathematical modeling, simulations, and Swiss surveillance data, we demonstrate that this bias does not affect estimation of the growth advantage of the variant and has only a limited and transient impact on estimates of the effective reproduction number. Thus, population-level epidemiological parameters derived from wastewater maintain their advantages over traditional clinical-derived estimates, even in the presence of differential shedding among variants.\nAn algorithm to build synthetic temporal contact networks based on close-proximity interactions data\nAuthors: Duval, A.; Leclerc, Q. J.; Guillemot, D.; Temime, L.; Opatowski, L.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23296945\nSmall populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. The increased availability of empirical individual contact data provides unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity. However, these detailed data are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in health care settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF). Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recoding bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks. The algorithm successfully reconstructed unobserved contacts, and was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The daily degree (10.8-14.7 vs 14.7-18.0), density (0.07-0.08 vs 0.08-0.10) and global efficiency (0.39-0.43; 0.46-0.49) were slightly overestimated. To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other settings using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.\nOnline trend estimation and detection of trend deviations in sub-sewershed time series of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured in wastewater.\nAuthors: Ensor, K. B.; Schedler, J. C.; Sun, T.; Schneider, R.; Mulenga, A.; Wu, J.; Stadler, L.; Hopkins, L.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297635\nWastewater surveillance has proven a key public health tool to understand a wide range of community health diseases and has proven to be especially critical to health departments throughout the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. The size of the population served by a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) may limit the targeted insight about community disease dynamics. To investigate this concern, samples of wastewater were obtained at lift stations upstream of WWTPs within the sewer network. First, an online, semi-automatic time series model is fitted to the weekly measurements of WWTP samples to estimate the viral trend for the community and compared to the time series observations from the lift stations. Second, deviations from the WWTP trend are identified using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart. The analysis reveals that the lift stations display slightly different dynamics than the larger WWTP, highlighting the more granular insight gleaned from sampling sites which represent smaller populations. Discussion focuses on the use of our methods to support rapid public health decision-making based on additional, targeted samples in times of concern.\nEpigenetic age and socioeconomic status contribute to racial disparities in cognitive and functional aging between Black and White older Americans\nAuthors: Yannatos, I.; Stites, S. D.; Boen, C.; Xie, S. X.; Brown, R. T.; McMillan, C. T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296351\nEpigenetic age, a biological aging marker measured by DNA methylation, is a potential mechanism by which social factors drive disparities in age-related health. Epigenetic age gap is the residual between epigenetic age measures and chronological age. Previous studies showed associations between epigenetic age gap and age-related outcomes including cognitive capacity and performance on some functional measures, but whether epigenetic age gap contributes to disparities in these outcomes is unknown. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the role of epigenetic age gap in racial disparities in cognitive and functional outcomes and consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Epigenetic age measures are GrimAge or Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). Cognitive outcomes are cross-sectional score and two-year change in Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Functional outcomes are prevalence and incidence of limitations performing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We find, relative to White participants, Black participants have lower scores and greater decline in TICS, higher prevalence and incidence rates of IADL limitations, and higher epigenetic age gap. Age- and gender-adjusted analyses reveal that higher GrimAge and DPoAm gap are both associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes and mediate 6-11% of racial disparities in cognitive outcomes and 19-39% of disparities in functional outcomes. Adjusting for SES attenuates most DPoAm associations and most mediation effects. These results support that epigenetic age gap contributes to racial disparities in cognition and functioning and may be an important mechanism linking social factors to disparities in health outcomes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged [&amp;ge;]65 years receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA-1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022.

The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the [&amp;ge;]85 year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.69 [1-21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.52 [1-21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.42 [22-42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.74 [1-21 days]) with mRNA-1273.222.

Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.17 [22-42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Emerging evidence suggests association of air pollution exposure with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of these findings are limited by study design, lack of individual-level covariate data or are specific to certain subpopulations. We aim to evaluate causal effects of air pollution on risk of infection, whilst overcoming these limitations. Methods Concentrations for black carbon(BC), particulate matter 10(PM10), particulate matter 2.5(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide(NO2) and oxides of nitrogen(NOx) from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and Effect of Low-level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe (ELAPSE) were linked to postcodes of 53,683 Virus Watch study participants. The primary outcome was first SARS-CoV-2 infection, between 1st September 2020 and 30th April 2021. Regression analysis used modified Poisson with robust estimates, clustered by household, adjusting for individual (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and environmental covariates(e.g., population density, region) to estimate total and direct effects. Results Single pollutant analysis showed the direct effect of higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with increased exposure to PM2.5(RR1.11,95%CI 1.08;1.15), PM10(RR1.06,95%CI 1.04;1.09), NO2(RR1.04,95%CI 1.04;1.05) and NOx(RR1.02,95%CI 1.02;1.02) per 1g/m3 increment with DEFRA 2015-19 data. Sensitivity analyses altering covariates, exposure window and modelled air pollution data source produced similar estimates. Higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 per 10-5m-1 increment of BC (RR1.86, 95%CI 1.62;2.14) was observed using ELAPSE data. Conclusion Long term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutions increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting that adverse health effects of air pollution is not only limited to non-communicable diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONAdverse events (AE) such as pain at injection site or fever are common after COVID-19 vaccination. We aimed to describe determinants of AE after COVID-19 vaccination and investigate the association between AE and pre- and post-vaccination antibody concentrations.

METHODSParticipants of an ongoing prospective cohort study (VASCO) completed a questionnaire on AE within two months after COVID-19 vaccination and provided 6-monthly serum samples. Data from May 2021 to November 2022 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate determinants of AE after mRNA vaccination, including pre-vaccination Ig antibody concentrations against the receptor binding domain. Multivariable linear regression was performed in SARS-CoV-2 naive participants to assess the association between AE and log-transformed antibody concentrations 3-8 weeks after mRNA vaccination.

RESULTS47,947 AE questionnaires were completed by 28,032 participants. In 42% and 34% of questionnaires, injection site and systemic AE were reported, respectively. In 2.2% of questionnaires, participants sought medical attention due to AE. AE were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger participants (&lt;60 years), participants with medical risk conditions and Spikevax recipients (versus Comirnaty). Higher pre-vaccination antibody concentrations were associated with higher incidence of systemic AE after the second and third dose, but not with injection site AE or AE for which medical attention was sought. Any AE after the third dose was associated with higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations (geometric mean concentration ratio: 1.38, 95%CI 1.23-1.54).

CONCLUSIONOur study suggests that high pre-vaccination antibody levels are associated with AE, and that experiencing AE may be a marker for a good antibody response to vaccination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy.

MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception.

Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95).

ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.

What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants.

What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Genome sequencing can offer critical insight into pathogen spread in viral outbreaks, but existing transmission inference methods use simplistic evolutionary models and only incorporate a portion of available genetic data. Here, we develop a robust evolutionary model for transmission reconstruction that tracks the genetic composition of within-host viral populations over time and the lineages transmitted between hosts. We confirm that our model reliably describes within-host variant frequencies in a dataset of 134,682 SARS-CoV-2 deep-sequenced genomes from Massachusetts, USA. We then demonstrate that our reconstruction approach infers transmissions more accurately than two leading methods on synthetic data, as well as in a controlled outbreak of bovine respiratory syncytial virus and an epidemiologically-investigated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in South Africa. Finally, we apply our transmission reconstruction tool to 5,692 outbreaks among the 134,682 Massachusetts genomes. Our methods and results demonstrate the utility of within-host variation for transmission inference of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, and provide an adaptable mathematical framework for tracking within-host evolution.</p>

MethodsPoisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020.

ResultsCorrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month. More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices.

ConclusionsWhile more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with &#34;long COVID&#34; to minimize road use.

What is already known about this topicPrevious short-term fluctuations in road deaths are related to changes in temperature, fuel prices, and truck registrations.

What this study addsCorrected for other risk factors, the monthly changes in road deaths from 2020 to 2021 in U.S. states were associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyStudies are needed to distinguish the potential relative effects of neurological damage as well as the stress of coping with the pandemic on driving, walking, and bicyclist behavior. Warning people with &#34;long covid&#34; about road risk is warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of wastewater-based epidemiology. Wastewater samples can provide genomic information for detecting and assessing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in communities and for estimating important epidemiological parameters such as the growth advantage of the variant. However, despite demonstrated successes, epidemiological data derived from wastewater suffers from potential biases. Of particular concern are differential shedding profiles that different variants of concern exhibit, because they can shift the relationship between viral loads in wastewater and prevalence estimates derived from clinical cases. Using mathematical modeling, simulations, and Swiss surveillance data, we demonstrate that this bias does not affect estimation of the growth advantage of the variant and has only a limited and transient impact on estimates of the effective reproduction number. Thus, population-level epidemiological parameters derived from wastewater maintain their advantages over traditional clinical-derived estimates, even in the presence of differential shedding among variants.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Small populations (e.g., hospitals, schools or workplaces) are characterised by high contact heterogeneity and stochasticity affecting pathogen transmission dynamics. The increased availability of empirical individual contact data provides unprecedented information to characterize such heterogeneity. However, these detailed data are usually collected over a limited period, and can suffer from observation bias. We propose an algorithm to stochastically reconstruct realistic temporal networks from individual contact data in health care settings (HCS) and test this approach using real data previously collected in a long-term care facility (LTCF).

Our algorithm generates full networks from recorded close-proximity interactions, using hourly inter-individual contact rates and information on individuals wards, the categories of staff involved in contacts, and the frequency of recurring contacts. It also provides data augmentation by reconstructing contacts for days when some individuals are present in the HCS without having contacts recorded in the empirical data. Recoding bias is formalized through an observation model, to allow direct comparison between the augmented and observed networks.

The algorithm successfully reconstructed unobserved contacts, and was substantially more accurate to reproduce network characteristics than random graphs. The reconstructed networks reproduced well the assortativity by ward (first-third quartiles observed: 0.54-0.64; synthetic: 0.52-0.64) and the hourly staff and patient contact patterns. Importantly, the observed temporal correlation was also well reproduced (0.39-0.50 vs 0.37-0.44), indicating that our algorithm could recreate a realistic temporal structure. The daily degree (10.8-14.7 vs 14.7-18.0), density (0.07-0.08 vs 0.08-0.10) and global efficiency (0.39-0.43; 0.46-0.49) were slightly overestimated.

To conclude, we propose an approach to generate realistic temporal contact networks and reconstruct unobserved contacts from summary statistics computed using individual-level interaction networks. This could be applied and extended to generate contact networks to other settings using limited empirical data, to subsequently inform individual-based epidemic models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wastewater surveillance has proven a key public health tool to understand a wide range of community health diseases and has proven to be especially critical to health departments throughout the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. The size of the population served by a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) may limit the targeted insight about community disease dynamics. To investigate this concern, samples of wastewater were obtained at lift stations upstream of WWTPs within the sewer network. First, an online, semi-automatic time series model is fitted to the weekly measurements of WWTP samples to estimate the viral trend for the community and compared to the time series observations from the lift stations. Second, deviations from the WWTP trend are identified using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart. The analysis reveals that the lift stations display slightly different dynamics than the larger WWTP, highlighting the more granular insight gleaned from sampling sites which represent smaller populations. Discussion focuses on the use of our methods to support rapid public health decision-making based on additional, targeted samples in times of concern.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epigenetic age, a biological aging marker measured by DNA methylation, is a potential mechanism by which social factors drive disparities in age-related health. Epigenetic age gap is the residual between epigenetic age measures and chronological age. Previous studies showed associations between epigenetic age gap and age-related outcomes including cognitive capacity and performance on some functional measures, but whether epigenetic age gap contributes to disparities in these outcomes is unknown. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine the role of epigenetic age gap in racial disparities in cognitive and functional outcomes and consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Epigenetic age measures are GrimAge or Dunedin Pace of Aging methylation (DPoAm). Cognitive outcomes are cross-sectional score and two-year change in Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Functional outcomes are prevalence and incidence of limitations performing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). We find, relative to White participants, Black participants have lower scores and greater decline in TICS, higher prevalence and incidence rates of IADL limitations, and higher epigenetic age gap. Age- and gender-adjusted analyses reveal that higher GrimAge and DPoAm gap are both associated with worse cognitive and functional outcomes and mediate 6-11% of racial disparities in cognitive outcomes and 19-39% of disparities in functional outcomes. Adjusting for SES attenuates most DPoAm associations and most mediation effects. These results support that epigenetic age gap contributes to racial disparities in cognition and functioning and may be an important mechanism linking social factors to disparities in health outcomes.</p>
