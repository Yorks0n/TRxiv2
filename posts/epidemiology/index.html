M.\nScore: 1426.6, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300512\nImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited. ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits. ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. KEY POINTS QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated? FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.\nCorrelations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality: comparing the strength before and after Omicron emergence\nAuthors: Storozhuk, M. V.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300136\nPurposeThere is rapidly growing in vitro pharmacological evidence suggesting preventive/therapeutic potential of green tea and its constituent EGCG in battle with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to analyze time course of previously reported correlations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality with a focus on comparing periods of time before (year 2021) and after (years 2022-2023) emergence of Omicron variant. MethodsCorrelations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality were calculated using multiple regression models in a subset (n=84) of countries/territories worldwide with HDI above 0.55. Strength of the correlations for several dates in 2021, 2022 and 2023 was compared. ResultsHigher per capita green tea consumption was associated with lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Statistically significant correlations were observed in 2021, 2022 and 2023. As compared to 2021, the strength of both correlations was decreased in 2022 and 2023. On average normalized to 2021 strength of correlation between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity decreased to 0.60, while normalized strength of correlation between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity decreased to 0.83. ConclusionOverall, the results of this study are in line with in vitro pharmacological evidence. Though indirectly, these results at epidemiological level support the idea that green tea consumption may have not only preventive, but also therapeutic value in relation to COVID-19. Nevertheless, because of limitations of this study, this idea still should be considered as a hypothesis requiring further assessment.\nEarly COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness of XBB.1.5 vaccine against hospitalization and ICU admission, the Netherlands, 9 October - 5 December 2023\nAuthors: van Werkhoven, H.; Valk, A.-W.; Smagge, B.; de Melker, H. E.; Knol, M. J.; Hahne, S.; van den Hof, S.; de Gier, B.\nScore: 881.2, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299855\nWe present early vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates of the 2023 seasonal COVID-19 vaccination campaign using XBB.1.5 vaccine against COVID-19 hospitalization and ICU admission in previously vaccinated adults [\u0026ge;]60 years old in the Netherlands. We compared vaccination status of 2050 hospitalizations including 92 ICU admissions with age group-, sex-, region- and date-specific population vaccination coverage between 9 October and 5 December 2023. VE against hospitalization was 70.7% (95% CI: 66.6; 74.3), VE against ICU admission was 73.3% (95% CI: 42.2; 87.6).\nNowcasting Reported COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using De-Identified, Aggregated Medical Insurance Claims Data\nAuthors: Shen, X.; Rumack, A.; Wilder, B.; Tibshirani, R. J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300471\nWe propose, implement, and evaluate a method for nowcasting the daily number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, at the level of individual US states, based on de-identified, aggregated medical insurance claims data. Our analysis proceeds under a hypothetical scenario in which, during the Delta wave, states only report data on the first day of each month, and on this day, report COVID-19 hospitalization counts for each day in the previous month. In this hypothetical scenario (just as in reality), medical insurance claims data continues to be available daily. At the beginning of each month, we train a regression model, using all data available thus far, to predict hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims. We then use this model to nowcast the (unseen) values of COVID-19 hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims, at each day in the following month. Our analysis uses properly-versioned data, which would have been available in real-time, at the time predictions are produced. In spite of the difficulties inherent to real-time estimation (e.g., latency and backfill) and the complex dynamics behind COVID-19 hospitalizations themselves, we find overall that medical insurance claims can be an accurate predictor of hospitalization reports, with mean absolute errors typically around 0.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, i.e., proportion of variance explained around 75%. Perhaps more importantly, we find that nowcasts made using medical insurance claims can qualitatively capture the dynamics (upswings and downswings) of hospitalization waves, which are key features that inform public health decision-making.\nDengue virus transmission in Italy: surveillance and epidemiological trends up to 2023\nAuthors: Branda, F.; Nakase, T.; Maruotti, A.; Scarpa, F.; Ciccozzi, A.; Romano, C.; Peletto, S.; Bispo de Filippis, A. M.; Alcantara, L. C. J.; Marcello, A.; Ciccozzi, M.; Lourenco, J.; Giovanetti, M.\nScore: 27.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300208\nDengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.\nAdverse Events Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Adolescents: A Norwegian Nationwide Register-Based Study\nAuthors: Bergstad Larsen, V.; Gunnes, N.; Gran, J. M.; Boas, H.; Dahl, J.; Viksmoen Watle, S.; Berild, J. D.; Greve-Isdahl, M.; Stoerdal, K.; Gulseth, H.; Karlstad, O.; Lopez-Doriga Ruiz, P.; Tapia, G.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299926\nBackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.\nGenetics, primary care records and lifestyle factors for short-term dynamic risk prediction of colorectal cancer: prospective study of asymptomatic and symptomatic UK Biobank participants\nAuthors: Ip, S. H. Y.; Harrison, H.; Usher-Smith, J.; Barclay, M. E.; Tyrer, J.; Dennis, J.; Yang, X.; Lush, M.; Renzi, C.; Pashayan, N.; Denaxas, S.; Lyratzopoulos, G.; Antoniou, A. C.; Wood, A. M.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300244\nObjectivesTo quantify the contributions of polygenic scores, primary care records (presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) and lifestyle factors, for short-term risk prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) in both all and symptomatic individuals. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingUK Biobank with follow-up until 2018. ParticipantsAll participants with linked primary care records (n=160,526), and a subcohort of participants with a presentation of a symptom associated with CRC (n=50,728). Main outcome measuresOutcome was the first recorded CRC diagnosis within two years. Dynamic risk models with time-varying predictors were derived in a super-landmark framework. Contributions to model discrimination were quantified using novel inclusion-order-agnostic Shapley values of Harrels C-index using cross-validation. ResultsC-indices [95% CIs] were 0.74 [0.72-0.75] and 0.71 [0.67-0.77] for the models derived in all and symptomatic participants respectively. The Shapley contributions to model discrimination differed between the two groups of participants for different predictors: 31% (32% in the symptomatic participants) for core predictors (e.g., age, sex, smoking), 16% (12%) for polygenic scores, 27% (30%) for primary care blood tests, 14% (14%) for primary care medical history, 8% (0.5%) for additional lifestyle factors and 4% (12%) for symptoms. ConclusionsPolygenic scores contribute substantially to short-term risk prediction for CRC in both general and symptomatic populations; however, the contribution of information in primary care records (including presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) is greater. There is, however, only a small contribution by the additional lifestyle risk factors which are not routinely collected in primary care.\nMild and moderate COVID-19 during Alpha, Delta and Omikron pandemic waves in urban Maputo, Mozambique, December 2020-March 2022: a population-based surveillance study\nAuthors: Ingelbeen, B.; Cumbane, V.; Mandlate, F.; Barbe, B.; Nhachungue, S.; Cavele, N.; Manhica, C.; Cubai, C.; Guenha, N.; Lacroix, A.; Marien, J.; de Weggheleire, A.; van Kleef, E.; Selhorst, P.; van der Sande, M. A.; Peeters, M.; Widdowson, M.-A.; Ismael, N.; Macicame, I.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300474\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, reported COVID-19 numbers have been lower than anticipated, even when considering populations younger age. The extent to which risk factors, established in industrialised countries, impact the risk of infection and of disease in populations in sub-Saharan Africa, remains unclear. We estimated the incidence of mild and moderate COVID-19 in urban Mozambique and analysed factors associated with infection and disease in a population-based surveillance study. During December 2020-March 2022, households of a population cohort in Polana Canico, Maputo, Mozambique, were contacted biweekly. Residents reporting any respiratory sign, anosmia, or ageusia, were asked to self-administer a nasal swab, for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Of a subset of 1400 participants, dried blood spots were repeatedly collected three-monthly from finger pricks at home. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein were detected using an in-house developed multiplex antibody assay. We estimated the incidence of respiratory illness and COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. We used Cox regression models, adjusting for age and sex, to identify factors associated with first symptomatic COVID-19 and with SARS-CoV-2 sero-conversion in the first six months. During 11925 household visits in 1561 households, covering 6049 participants (median 21 years, 54.8% female, 7.3% disclosed HIV positive), 1895.9 person-years were followed up. Per 1000 person-years, 364.5 (95%CI 352.8-376.1) respiratory illness episodes of which 72.2 (95%CI 60.6-83.9) COVID-19 confirmed, were reported. Of 1412 participants, 2185 blood samples were tested (median 30.6 years, 55.2% female). Sero-prevalence rose from 4.8% (95%CI 1.1-8.6%) in December 2020 to 34.7% (95%CI 20.2-49.3%) in June 2021, when 3.0% were vaccinated. Increasing age (strong gradient in hazard ratio, HR, up to 15.70 in [\u0026ge;]70 year olds, 95%CI 3.74-65.97), leukaemia, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and overweight increased risk of COVID-19. We found no increased risk of COVID-19 in people with HIV or tuberculosis. Risk of COVID-19 was lower among residents in the lowest socio-economic quintile (HR 0.16, 95%CI 0.04-0.64), with no or limited handwashing facilities, and who shared bedrooms (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.25-0.72). Older age also increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (HR 1.57 in 60-69 year olds, 95%CI 1.03-2.39). We found no associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and socio-economic, behavioural factors and comorbidities. Active surveillance in an urban population cohort confirmed frequent COVID-19 underreporting, yet indicated that the large majority of cases were mild and non-febrile. In contrast to industrialised countries, deprivation did not increase the risk of infection nor disease.\nThe duration of lithium use and biological ageing: telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age and all-cause mortality\nAuthors: Mutz, J.; Wong, W. L. E.; Powell, T. R.; Young, A. H.; Dawe, G. S.; Lewis, C. M.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300105\nBackgroundLithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality. MethodsThe UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality. Results591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality. ConclusionsWe observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.\nImpact of COVID-19 on mental illness in vaccinated and unvaccinated people: a population-based cohort study in OpenSAFELY\nAuthors: Walker, V.; Patalay, P.; Cuitin Coronado, J.

A.\nScore: 41.8, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299602\nBackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19. OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19. InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited.

ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits.

ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

KEY POINTS

QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated?

FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThere is rapidly growing in vitro pharmacological evidence suggesting preventive/therapeutic potential of green tea and its constituent EGCG in battle with COVID-19. The aim of this study was to analyze time course of previously reported correlations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality with a focus on comparing periods of time before (year 2021) and after (years 2022-2023) emergence of Omicron variant.

MethodsCorrelations between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity/mortality were calculated using multiple regression models in a subset (n=84) of countries/territories worldwide with HDI above 0.55. Strength of the correlations for several dates in 2021, 2022 and 2023 was compared.

ResultsHigher per capita green tea consumption was associated with lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Statistically significant correlations were observed in 2021, 2022 and 2023. As compared to 2021, the strength of both correlations was decreased in 2022 and 2023. On average normalized to 2021 strength of correlation between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity decreased to 0.60, while normalized strength of correlation between per capita green tea consumption and COVID-19 morbidity decreased to 0.83.

ConclusionOverall, the results of this study are in line with in vitro pharmacological evidence. Though indirectly, these results at epidemiological level support the idea that green tea consumption may have not only preventive, but also therapeutic value in relation to COVID-19. Nevertheless, because of limitations of this study, this idea still should be considered as a hypothesis requiring further assessment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We propose, implement, and evaluate a method for nowcasting the daily number of new COVID-19 hospitalizations, at the level of individual US states, based on de-identified, aggregated medical insurance claims data. Our analysis proceeds under a hypothetical scenario in which, during the Delta wave, states only report data on the first day of each month, and on this day, report COVID-19 hospitalization counts for each day in the previous month. In this hypothetical scenario (just as in reality), medical insurance claims data continues to be available daily. At the beginning of each month, we train a regression model, using all data available thus far, to predict hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims. We then use this model to nowcast the (unseen) values of COVID-19 hospitalization counts from medical insurance claims, at each day in the following month. Our analysis uses properly-versioned data, which would have been available in real-time, at the time predictions are produced. In spite of the difficulties inherent to real-time estimation (e.g., latency and backfill) and the complex dynamics behind COVID-19 hospitalizations themselves, we find overall that medical insurance claims can be an accurate predictor of hospitalization reports, with mean absolute errors typically around 0.4 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, i.e., proportion of variance explained around 75%. Perhaps more importantly, we find that nowcasts made using medical insurance claims can qualitatively capture the dynamics (upswings and downswings) of hospitalization waves, which are key features that inform public health decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway.

Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows.

ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression.

ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo quantify the contributions of polygenic scores, primary care records (presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) and lifestyle factors, for short-term risk prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) in both all and symptomatic individuals.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUK Biobank with follow-up until 2018.

ParticipantsAll participants with linked primary care records (n=160,526), and a subcohort of participants with a presentation of a symptom associated with CRC (n=50,728).

Main outcome measuresOutcome was the first recorded CRC diagnosis within two years. Dynamic risk models with time-varying predictors were derived in a super-landmark framework. Contributions to model discrimination were quantified using novel inclusion-order-agnostic Shapley values of Harrels C-index using cross-validation.

ResultsC-indices [95% CIs] were 0.74 [0.72-0.75] and 0.71 [0.67-0.77] for the models derived in all and symptomatic participants respectively. The Shapley contributions to model discrimination differed between the two groups of participants for different predictors: 31% (32% in the symptomatic participants) for core predictors (e.g., age, sex, smoking), 16% (12%) for polygenic scores, 27% (30%) for primary care blood tests, 14% (14%) for primary care medical history, 8% (0.5%) for additional lifestyle factors and 4% (12%) for symptoms.

ConclusionsPolygenic scores contribute substantially to short-term risk prediction for CRC in both general and symptomatic populations; however, the contribution of information in primary care records (including presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) is greater. There is, however, only a small contribution by the additional lifestyle risk factors which are not routinely collected in primary care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In sub-Saharan Africa, reported COVID-19 numbers have been lower than anticipated, even when considering populations younger age. The extent to which risk factors, established in industrialised countries, impact the risk of infection and of disease in populations in sub-Saharan Africa, remains unclear. We estimated the incidence of mild and moderate COVID-19 in urban Mozambique and analysed factors associated with infection and disease in a population-based surveillance study.

During December 2020-March 2022, households of a population cohort in Polana Canico, Maputo, Mozambique, were contacted biweekly. Residents reporting any respiratory sign, anosmia, or ageusia, were asked to self-administer a nasal swab, for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Of a subset of 1400 participants, dried blood spots were repeatedly collected three-monthly from finger pricks at home. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein were detected using an in-house developed multiplex antibody assay. We estimated the incidence of respiratory illness and COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. We used Cox regression models, adjusting for age and sex, to identify factors associated with first symptomatic COVID-19 and with SARS-CoV-2 sero-conversion in the first six months.

During 11925 household visits in 1561 households, covering 6049 participants (median 21 years, 54.8% female, 7.3% disclosed HIV positive), 1895.9 person-years were followed up. Per 1000 person-years, 364.5 (95%CI 352.8-376.1) respiratory illness episodes of which 72.2 (95%CI 60.6-83.9) COVID-19 confirmed, were reported. Of 1412 participants, 2185 blood samples were tested (median 30.6 years, 55.2% female). Sero-prevalence rose from 4.8% (95%CI 1.1-8.6%) in December 2020 to 34.7% (95%CI 20.2-49.3%) in June 2021, when 3.0% were vaccinated. Increasing age (strong gradient in hazard ratio, HR, up to 15.70 in [&amp;ge;]70 year olds, 95%CI 3.74-65.97), leukaemia, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and overweight increased risk of COVID-19. We found no increased risk of COVID-19 in people with HIV or tuberculosis. Risk of COVID-19 was lower among residents in the lowest socio-economic quintile (HR 0.16, 95%CI 0.04-0.64), with no or limited handwashing facilities, and who shared bedrooms (HR 0.42, 95%CI 0.25-0.72). Older age also increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (HR 1.57 in 60-69 year olds, 95%CI 1.03-2.39). We found no associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and socio-economic, behavioural factors and comorbidities.

Active surveillance in an urban population cohort confirmed frequent COVID-19 underreporting, yet indicated that the large majority of cases were mild and non-febrile. In contrast to industrialised countries, deprivation did not increase the risk of infection nor disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality.

MethodsThe UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality.

Results591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality.

ConclusionsWe observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 is associated with subsequent mental illness in both hospital- and population-based studies. Evidence regarding effects of COVID-19 vaccination on mental health consequences of COVID-19 is limited.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we used linked electronic health records (OpenSAFELY-TPP) to conduct analyses in a  pre-vaccination cohort (17,619,987 people) followed during the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and  vaccinated and  unvaccinated cohorts (13,716,225 and 3,130,581 people respectively) during the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing the incidence of mental illness after diagnosis of COVID-19 with the incidence before or without COVID-19.

OutcomesWe considered eight outcomes: depression, serious mental illness, general anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addiction, self-harm, and suicide. Incidence of most outcomes was elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with before or without COVID-19, in each cohort. Vaccination mitigated the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health: aHRs (95% CIs) for depression and for serious mental illness during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19 were 1.93 (1.88-1.98) and 1.42 (1.24-1.61) respectively in the pre-vaccination cohort and 1.79 (1.68-1.91) and 2.21 (1.99-2.45) respectively in the unvaccinated cohort, compared with 1.16 (1.12-1.20) and 0.91 (0.84-0.98) respectively in the vaccinated cohort. Elevation in incidence was higher, and persisted for longer, after hospitalised than non-hospitalised COVID-19.

InterpretationIncidence of mental illness is elevated for up to a year following severe COVID-19 in unvaccinated people. Vaccination mitigates the adverse effect of COVID-19 on mental health.
