Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023. MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths. FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [\u0026ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [\u0026ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [\u0026ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period. InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures. FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest. Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [\u0026ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [\u0026ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [\u0026ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967). Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.\nDeaths induced by compassionate use of hydroxychloroquine during the first COVID-19 wave: the devil is in the details.\nAuthors: Beaudart, C.; Douxfils, J.; Musuamba, F.; Dogne, J.-M.\nScore: 70.1, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301464\nSeveral trials of different designs were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and/or the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ. We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality. Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.\nBNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted Vaccine and COVID-19 Hospital Admissions and Ambulatory Visits in US Adults\nAuthors: Tartof, S. Y.; Slezak, J. M.; Frankland, T. B.; Puzniak, L.; Hong, V.; Ackerson, B. K.; Stern, J. A.; Simmons, S.; Jodar, L.; McLaughlin, J. M.\nScore: 2256.6, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.23300512\nImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited. ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits. ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. KEY POINTS QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated? FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.\nRisk factors for experiencing Long-COVID symptoms: Insights from two nationally representative surveys\nAuthors: Wu, Y.; Sawano, M.; Wu, Y.; Shah, R.; Bishop, P.; Iwasaki, A.; Krumholz, H.\nScore: 22.2, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301170\nBackgroundLong COVID (LC) is a complex and multisystemic condition marked by a diverse range of symptoms, yet its associated risk factors remain poorly defined. MethodsLeveraging data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), both representative of the United States population, this study aimed to identify demographic characteristics associated with LC. The sample was restricted to individuals aged 18 years and older who reported a positive COVID-19 test or doctors diagnosis. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing characteristics between participants with and without LC. Furthermore, we developed multivariate logistic regression models on demographic covariates that would have been valid at the time of the COVID-19 infection. ResultsAmong the 124,313 individuals in BRFSS and 10,131 in the NHIS reporting either a positive test or doctors diagnosis for COVID-19 (Table), 26,783 (21.5%) in BRFSS and 1,797 (17.1%) in NHIS reported LC. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we found middle age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of a college degree, and residence in non-metropolitan areas associated with higher risk of LC. Notably, the initial severity of acute COVID-19 was strongly associated with LC risk. In contrast, significantly lower ORs were reported for Non-Hispanic Asian and Black Americans compared to Non-Hispanic White. ConclusionsIn the United States, there is marked variation in the risk of LC by demographic factors and initial infection severity. Further research is needed to understand the underlying cause of these observations.\nLong COVID Disability Burden in US Adults: YLDs and NIH Funding Relative to Other Conditions\nAuthors: Bonuck, K.; Gao, Q.; Congdon, S.; Kim, R.\nScore: 126.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301057\nBackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex. MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions. FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (\u003c1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition. InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden. Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords \"years lived with disability\" + \"COVID\" yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced \"disability-adjusted life years\" (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, \"disease burden\" + Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact. We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions. Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at \u003c1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was \u003e= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions. Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.\nImpact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 on total and cause-specific maternal mortality: A natural experiment in Chile during the peak of the outbreak SARS-CoV-2 Impact on Maternal Mortality: Chiles Outbreak Study\nAuthors: Enriquez, Y.; Critto, M. E.; Weinberg, R.; de Janon Quevedo, L.; Galleguillos, A.; Koch, E.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301426\nBackgroundThis study estimated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on maternal death causes in Chile during the outbreak peak between 2020 and 2021. Materials and MethodsA natural experiment was conducted using official data on maternal deaths and live births (LBs) between 1997 and 2021. Trend changes in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were assessed using segmented regression. The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected rates on MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). FindingsITS analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak impacted the MMR due to indirect causes, with a greater increase in indirect nonrespiratory causes than respiratory causes. The ARIMA forecast was consistent with ITS, showing that the expected MMR for indirect causes was substantially lower than the observed rates (9.65 in 2020 and 7.46/100,000 LBs in 2021). The expected MMR was 3.44 in 2020 and 1.55 in 2021. For nonrespiratory causes, the observed values of the MMR for 2020 (8.77/100.000 LBs) and 2021 (7.46/100.000 LBs) doubled the prediction 4.02 (95% CI: 0.44-7.61) and 3.83 (95% CI: -0.12-7.79). No significant effect was found on direct obstetrical deaths. InterpretationDuring 2020-2021, there was a rise in the MMR in Chile attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic contributed to an escalation in the MMR due to indirect causes, particularly nonrespiratory and infectious causes, suggesting that the risk of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 was increased from previous comorbidities.\nUnifying human infectious disease models and real-time awareness of population- and subpopulation-level intervention effectiveness\nAuthors: Seibel, R.

M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301344\nBackgroundDuring infectious disease outbreaks, humans often base their decision to adhere to an intervention strategy on their personal opinion towards the intervention, perceived risk of infection and intervention effectiveness. However, due to data limitations and inference challenges, infectious disease models usually omit variables that may impact an individuals decision to get vaccinated and their awareness of the interventions effectiveness of disease control within their social contacts as well as the overall population. MethodsWe constructed a compartmental, deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) disease model that includes a behavioural function with parameters influencing intervention uptake. The behavioural function accounted for an initial subpopulation opinion towards an intervention, their outbreak information sensitivity and the extent they are swayed by the real-time intervention effectiveness information (at a subpopulation- and population-level). Applying the model to vaccination uptake and three human pathogens - pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus - we explored through model simulation how these intervention adherence decision parameters and behavioural heterogeneity in the population impacted epidemiological outcomes. ResultsFrom our model simulations we found that differences in preference towards outbreak information were pathogen-specific. Therefore, in some pathogen systems, outbreak information types at different outbreak stages may be more informative to an information-sensitive population and lead to less severe epidemic outcomes. In both behaviourally-homogeneous and behaviourally-heterogeneous populations, pandemic influenza showed patterns distinct from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola for cumulative epidemiological metrics of interest. Furthermore, there was notable sensitivity in outbreak size under different assumptions regarding the population split in behavioural traits. Outbreak information preference was sensitive to vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the importance of considering human behaviour during outbreaks in the context of the perceived effectiveness of the intervention. ImplicationsIncorporating behavioural functions that modify infection control intervention adherence into epidemiological models can aid our understanding of adherence dynamics during outbreaks. Ultimately, by parameterising models with what we know about human behaviour towards vaccination (and other infection control interventions) adherence, such models can help assist decision makers during outbreaks. Such progress will be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases when there is initially little information on the disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness.\nClinical Characteristics and Factors Associated with Long COVID in Zambia, August 2020 to January 2023\nAuthors: Malambo, W.; Chanda, D.; Besa, L.; Engamba, D.; Mwiinga, L.; Mwitumwa, M.; Matibula, P.; Naik, N.; Sivile, S.; Agolory, S.; Auld, A.; Mulenga, L.; Hines, J. Z.; Fwoloshi, S.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301423\nBackgroundSeveral seroprevalence studies in Africa documented the extent of spread of SARS-CoV-2, yet there is limited data on signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection (long COVID). We sought to examine patient characteristics at post-acute COVID-19 (PAC-19) clinics in Zambia and assess factors associated with long COVID at first visit to a PAC-19 clinic and longitudinally among a cohort of patients. MethodsLong COVID was defined, initially in the Zambia PAC-19 clinical guidelines, as new, relapsing or persistent symptoms lasting \u003e4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe illness was defined as COVID-19 episode that required supplemental oxygen therapy, intensive care unit stay or treatment with steroids/remdesivir. We fitted logistic regression models with cross-sectional and longitudinal data and considered statistical significance at p\u003c0.05. ResultsIn total, 1,359 patients attended PAC-19 clinics and had data abstracted from Aug-2020 to Jan-2023; 548 (40.3%) patients with [\u0026ge;]2 visits were included in the longitudinal analysis. Patients median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR]: 41-63) years, 919 (67.6%) were hospitalized for acute COVID-19, and of whom 686 (74.6%) had severe illness. Patients with hospital length of stay [\u0026ge;]15 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.06-10.3), severe illness (aOR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.68-6.75), and comorbidities (aOR:1.51; 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) had significantly higher odds of long COVID. Longitudinally, long COVID prevalence significantly (p\u003c0.001) declined from 75.4% at the first PAC-19 visit to 26.0% by the fifth visit. The median follow-up time was 7 (IQR: 4-12) weeks. ConclusionLong COVID symptoms were common among patient presenting for care in PAC-19 clinics in Zambia, but most recovered within [~]2 months. Despite potentially substantial morbidity due to long COVID, few patients overall with COVID-19 attended a PAC-19 clinic. Scaling up PAC-19 services and integrating into routine clinical care could improve access by patients.\nPopulation-based cancer incidence and mortality rates and ratios among adults with intellectual disabilities in Scotland\nAuthors: Ward, L. M.; Cooper, S.-A.; Sosenko, F.; Morrison, D.; Fleming, M.; McCowan, C.; Robb, K.; Hanna, C.; Hughes-McCormack, L.; Dunn, K.; Conway, D.; Henderson, A.; Smith, G.; Truesdale, M.; Cairns, D.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.23300433\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSTo provide contemporary data on cancer mortality rates within the context of incidence in the population with intellectual disabilities. MethodsScotlands 2011 Census was used to identify adults with intellectual disabilities and controls with records linked to the Scottish Cancer Registry and death certificate data (March 2011-December 2019). The control cohort without intellectual disabilities and/or autism were used for indirect standardisation and calculation of Crude Incident Rates/Crude Mortality Rates (CIR/CMR), and age-sex Standardized Incident Rate Ratios/ Standardized Mortality Ratios (SIR/SMR), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities were most likely diagnosed cancers of digestive, specifically colorectal (14.2%), lung (9.3%), breast (female 22.9%), body of the uterus (female 9.3%) and male genital organs (male 17.6%). Higher incident cancers included metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SIR=1.70, male SIR=2.08), body of uterus (female SIR=1.63), ovarian (female SIR=1.59), kidney (female SIR=1.85), and testicular (male SIR=2.49). SMRs were higher, regardless of a higher, similar, or lower incidence (female SMR=1.34, male SMR=1.07). Excess mortality risk was found for colorectal (male SMR=1.59), kidney (female SMR=2.85u), female genital organs (ovarian SMR=2.86u, body of uterus SMR=2.11), breast (female SMR=1.58), and metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SMR=2.50u, male SMR=2.84). ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to die of cancer than the general population. Reasons for this may include later presentation/diagnosis (so poorer outcomes), poorer treatment/compliance, or both. Accessible public health approaches are important for people with intellectual disabilities, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the different cancer experiences faced by this population. Summary boxO_TEXTBOXStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIOur key strength is the comprehensive coverage of Scotlands entire adult population with intellectual disabilities, and inclusion of a representative general population comparison group. C_LIO_LIBy using nationwide robust data linkage of high-quality electronic health records, we provide reliable data with minimal bias. C_LIO_LILimitations include our inability to account for cancer incidence before the census date. However, prospective collection of data over nearly 9 years provided well-powered person-time for rate calculation, allowing for a meaningful interpretation of mortality rates in the context of incidence. C_LIO_LIDeath certificate data imprecision is considered, but our dual-analysis (main-cause and all-cause analyses), mitigates differences and indeed have similar interpretations.

M.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Thwai, K.; Boyter, K.; Munyaneza, T.; Mambo Muvunyi, C.; De Dieu Butera, J.; Bailey, J. A.; Mazarati, J.-B.; Juliano, J. J.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301054\nBackgroundMalaria remains a major cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs. MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors. ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria. ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter &#34;CAT&#34;) reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023.

MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [&amp;ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [&amp;ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [&amp;ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period.

InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest.

Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [&amp;ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [&amp;ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [&amp;ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several trials of different designs were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and/or the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ.

We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality.

Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited.

ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits.

ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

KEY POINTS

QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated?

FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID (LC) is a complex and multisystemic condition marked by a diverse range of symptoms, yet its associated risk factors remain poorly defined.

MethodsLeveraging data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), both representative of the United States population, this study aimed to identify demographic characteristics associated with LC. The sample was restricted to individuals aged 18 years and older who reported a positive COVID-19 test or doctors diagnosis. We performed a descriptive analysis comparing characteristics between participants with and without LC. Furthermore, we developed multivariate logistic regression models on demographic covariates that would have been valid at the time of the COVID-19 infection.

ResultsAmong the 124,313 individuals in BRFSS and 10,131 in the NHIS reporting either a positive test or doctors diagnosis for COVID-19 (Table), 26,783 (21.5%) in BRFSS and 1,797 (17.1%) in NHIS reported LC. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we found middle age, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of a college degree, and residence in non-metropolitan areas associated with higher risk of LC. Notably, the initial severity of acute COVID-19 was strongly associated with LC risk. In contrast, significantly lower ORs were reported for Non-Hispanic Asian and Black Americans compared to Non-Hispanic White.

ConclusionsIn the United States, there is marked variation in the risk of LC by demographic factors and initial infection severity. Further research is needed to understand the underlying cause of these observations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong COVID (LC) is novel, debilitating and likely chronic. Yet, scant data exist about its disability burden to guide scientific research and public health planning. We estimated Long COVIDs non-fatal disease burden in US adults and its FY2024 actual: burden-commensurate research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) relative to other conditions, and biological sex.

MethodsWe present YLDs/100,000 for 70 NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDCs). Prevalence of disabling Long COVID was obtained from cross sectional surveys of representative samples of US adults, from September 2022 to August 2023. Disabling Long COVID was defined as incident symptoms persisting more than 3 months post-COVID, that significantly compromise daily activities. We calculated burden-commensurate funding for the top YLD conditions and for female vs. male dominant conditions.

FindingsDisabling Long COVID was reported by 1.5% (n= 10,401) of n=757,580 respondents: Compared to the overall sample, those with disabling LC disproportionately identify as female (64.4% vs. 51.4%) and experiencing disability (80.8% vs. 52.9%) anxiety (57.5% vs. 23.8%) and depression (51.3% vs.18.5%). It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its actual: YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less actual: burden: commensurate funding, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (&lt;1%), another post-viral, female-dominant condition.

InterpretationLC has debilitated 3.8 million (weighted frequency) US adults. Research funding for it, like other female dominant conditions, lags behind its disability burden.

Research in ContextEvidence before this study - We analyzed Long-COVIDs (LC) non-fatal disease burden in the US--represented by YLD (years lived with disability= prevalence x disability weight) -- and National Institutes of Health (NIH) research 2024 funding relative to other conditions. We searched PubMed through 11/28/2023 for Long COVID prevalence (US), and Long COVID disability and disease burden (not US-specific). The keywords &#34;years lived with disability&#34; &#43; &#34;COVID&#34; yielded n= 38 articles (11/29/23); but most referenced &#34;disability-adjusted life years&#34; (DALYs) in other countries. Similarly, &#34;disease burden&#34; &#43; Long COVID yielded 23 papers, but no US YLD data. See Supplement 1 for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and US studies of Long COVID prevalence and impact.

We instead sourced YLD data from the US Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey (HPS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) /Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Long COVID Study Group. The HPS queries adults about Long COVID-related symptoms and their impact on daily activities. We applied the IHME/GBDs estimated Long COVID disability weight of 0.21 and harmonized it with our LC case definition from the HPS data in consultation with IHME/GBD researchers. To harmonize IHME/GBD disability weights for non-LC diseases/conditions with the NIHs terminology, we consulted with NIH staff. LC definition and measurement affects prevalence and burden estimates; our use of high-quality data sources and transparency in reporting how they were applied reduces the risk of biased assumptions.

Added value of this study- Long COVID is a chronic debilitating condition. While there is ample research on COVIDs acute illness and loss of life, there are no population-based data on its disability burden. We provide that data. To guide scientific research and public health planning, we report YLDs associated with disabling Long COVID (i.e., symptoms significantly limit activity), and; compare it to other conditions YLDs, NIH funding, and female-vs. male-dominance. It ranked in the top 25% of YLDs at 320/100,000, between Alzheimers (279.4/100,000) and asthma (355.7/100,000) but received just 10% of its YLD-commensurate funding. Only 5 conditions received less burden-commensurate funding; 3/5 were female-dominant, including Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) at &lt;1%, another post-viral condition that shares significant overlap with Long COVID. Overall, median funding/YLD was &gt;= 5 times greater for male-vs. female-dominant conditions.

Implications of all the available evidence-Nearly 4 million US adults (weighted frequency) live with disabling Long COVID. They disproportionately identify as female and as having a disability, anxiety and depression. Yet NIH funding for diagnostic and treatment research for Long COVID hasnt kept pace with its disability burden.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThis study estimated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on maternal death causes in Chile during the outbreak peak between 2020 and 2021.

Materials and MethodsA natural experiment was conducted using official data on maternal deaths and live births (LBs) between 1997 and 2021. Trend changes in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were assessed using segmented regression. The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected rates on MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

FindingsITS analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak impacted the MMR due to indirect causes, with a greater increase in indirect nonrespiratory causes than respiratory causes. The ARIMA forecast was consistent with ITS, showing that the expected MMR for indirect causes was substantially lower than the observed rates (9.65 in 2020 and 7.46/100,000 LBs in 2021). The expected MMR was 3.44 in 2020 and 1.55 in 2021. For nonrespiratory causes, the observed values of the MMR for 2020 (8.77/100.000 LBs) and 2021 (7.46/100.000 LBs) doubled the prediction 4.02 (95% CI: 0.44-7.61) and 3.83 (95% CI: -0.12-7.79). No significant effect was found on direct obstetrical deaths.

InterpretationDuring 2020-2021, there was a rise in the MMR in Chile attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic contributed to an escalation in the MMR due to indirect causes, particularly nonrespiratory and infectious causes, suggesting that the risk of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 was increased from previous comorbidities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDuring infectious disease outbreaks, humans often base their decision to adhere to an intervention strategy on their personal opinion towards the intervention, perceived risk of infection and intervention effectiveness. However, due to data limitations and inference challenges, infectious disease models usually omit variables that may impact an individuals decision to get vaccinated and their awareness of the interventions effectiveness of disease control within their social contacts as well as the overall population.

MethodsWe constructed a compartmental, deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) disease model that includes a behavioural function with parameters influencing intervention uptake. The behavioural function accounted for an initial subpopulation opinion towards an intervention, their outbreak information sensitivity and the extent they are swayed by the real-time intervention effectiveness information (at a subpopulation- and population-level). Applying the model to vaccination uptake and three human pathogens - pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus - we explored through model simulation how these intervention adherence decision parameters and behavioural heterogeneity in the population impacted epidemiological outcomes.

ResultsFrom our model simulations we found that differences in preference towards outbreak information were pathogen-specific. Therefore, in some pathogen systems, outbreak information types at different outbreak stages may be more informative to an information-sensitive population and lead to less severe epidemic outcomes. In both behaviourally-homogeneous and behaviourally-heterogeneous populations, pandemic influenza showed patterns distinct from SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola for cumulative epidemiological metrics of interest. Furthermore, there was notable sensitivity in outbreak size under different assumptions regarding the population split in behavioural traits. Outbreak information preference was sensitive to vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the importance of considering human behaviour during outbreaks in the context of the perceived effectiveness of the intervention.

ImplicationsIncorporating behavioural functions that modify infection control intervention adherence into epidemiological models can aid our understanding of adherence dynamics during outbreaks. Ultimately, by parameterising models with what we know about human behaviour towards vaccination (and other infection control interventions) adherence, such models can help assist decision makers during outbreaks. Such progress will be particularly important for emerging infectious diseases when there is initially little information on the disease dynamics and intervention effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSeveral seroprevalence studies in Africa documented the extent of spread of SARS-CoV-2, yet there is limited data on signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection (long COVID). We sought to examine patient characteristics at post-acute COVID-19 (PAC-19) clinics in Zambia and assess factors associated with long COVID at first visit to a PAC-19 clinic and longitudinally among a cohort of patients.

MethodsLong COVID was defined, initially in the Zambia PAC-19 clinical guidelines, as new, relapsing or persistent symptoms lasting &gt;4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe illness was defined as COVID-19 episode that required supplemental oxygen therapy, intensive care unit stay or treatment with steroids/remdesivir. We fitted logistic regression models with cross-sectional and longitudinal data and considered statistical significance at p&lt;0.05.

ResultsIn total, 1,359 patients attended PAC-19 clinics and had data abstracted from Aug-2020 to Jan-2023; 548 (40.3%) patients with [&amp;ge;]2 visits were included in the longitudinal analysis. Patients median age was 53 (interquartile range [IQR]: 41-63) years, 919 (67.6%) were hospitalized for acute COVID-19, and of whom 686 (74.6%) had severe illness. Patients with hospital length of stay [&amp;ge;]15 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.06-10.3), severe illness (aOR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.68-6.75), and comorbidities (aOR:1.51; 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) had significantly higher odds of long COVID. Longitudinally, long COVID prevalence significantly (p&lt;0.001) declined from 75.4% at the first PAC-19 visit to 26.0% by the fifth visit. The median follow-up time was 7 (IQR: 4-12) weeks.

ConclusionLong COVID symptoms were common among patient presenting for care in PAC-19 clinics in Zambia, but most recovered within [~]2 months. Despite potentially substantial morbidity due to long COVID, few patients overall with COVID-19 attended a PAC-19 clinic. Scaling up PAC-19 services and integrating into routine clinical care could improve access by patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSTo provide contemporary data on cancer mortality rates within the context of incidence in the population with intellectual disabilities.

MethodsScotlands 2011 Census was used to identify adults with intellectual disabilities and controls with records linked to the Scottish Cancer Registry and death certificate data (March 2011-December 2019). The control cohort without intellectual disabilities and/or autism were used for indirect standardisation and calculation of Crude Incident Rates/Crude Mortality Rates (CIR/CMR), and age-sex Standardized Incident Rate Ratios/ Standardized Mortality Ratios (SIR/SMR), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).

ResultsAdults with intellectual disabilities were most likely diagnosed cancers of digestive, specifically colorectal (14.2%), lung (9.3%), breast (female 22.9%), body of the uterus (female 9.3%) and male genital organs (male 17.6%). Higher incident cancers included metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SIR=1.70, male SIR=2.08), body of uterus (female SIR=1.63), ovarian (female SIR=1.59), kidney (female SIR=1.85), and testicular (male SIR=2.49). SMRs were higher, regardless of a higher, similar, or lower incidence (female SMR=1.34, male SMR=1.07). Excess mortality risk was found for colorectal (male SMR=1.59), kidney (female SMR=2.85u), female genital organs (ovarian SMR=2.86u, body of uterus SMR=2.11), breast (female SMR=1.58), and metastatic cancer of unknown primary origin (female SMR=2.50u, male SMR=2.84).

ConclusionsAdults with intellectual disabilities were more likely to die of cancer than the general population. Reasons for this may include later presentation/diagnosis (so poorer outcomes), poorer treatment/compliance, or both. Accessible public health approaches are important for people with intellectual disabilities, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the different cancer experiences faced by this population.

Summary boxO_TEXTBOXStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIOur key strength is the comprehensive coverage of Scotlands entire adult population with intellectual disabilities, and inclusion of a representative general population comparison group.
C_LIO_LIBy using nationwide robust data linkage of high-quality electronic health records, we provide reliable data with minimal bias.
C_LIO_LILimitations include our inability to account for cancer incidence before the census date. However, prospective collection of data over nearly 9 years provided well-powered person-time for rate calculation, allowing for a meaningful interpretation of mortality rates in the context of incidence.
C_LIO_LIDeath certificate data imprecision is considered, but our dual-analysis (main-cause and all-cause analyses), mitigates differences and indeed have similar interpretations.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMalaria remains a major cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs.

MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors.

ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria.

ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.</p>
