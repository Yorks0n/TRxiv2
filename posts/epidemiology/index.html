Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1. MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.\nCombining genomic data and infection estimates to characterize the complex dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States\nAuthors: Lopes, R.; Pham, K.; Klaassen, F.; Chitwood, M. H.; Hahn, A.; Redmond, S.; Swartwood, N. A.; Salomon, J. A.; Menzies, N. A.; Cohen, T.; Grubaugh, N. D.\nScore: 150.4, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298178\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nTravel surveillance uncovers dengue virus dynamics and introductions in the Caribbean\nAuthors: Taylor-Salmon, E.; Hill, V.; Paul, L.

H.; Vogels, C. B. F.; Morrison, A. M.; Michael, S. F.; Gru\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.23298412\nDengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and cases are continuing to rise globally. In particular, islands in the Caribbean have experienced more frequent outbreaks, and all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been reported in the region, leading to hyperendemicity and increased rates of severe disease. However, there is significant variability regarding virus surveillance and reporting between islands, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the epidemiological patterns in the Caribbean. To investigate this, we used travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology to reconstruct outbreak dynamics, DENV serotype turnover, and patterns of spread within the region from 2009-2022. We uncovered two recent DENV-3 introductions from Asia, one of which resulted in a large outbreak in Cuba, which was previously under-reported. We also show that while outbreaks can be synchronized between islands, they are often caused by different serotypes. Our study highlights the importance of surveillance of infected travelers to provide a snapshot of local introductions and transmission in areas with limited local surveillance and suggests that the recent DENV-3 introductions may pose a major public health threat in the region.\nAssociation between combined sewer overflow events and gastrointestinal illness in Massachusetts municipalities with and without river-sourced drinking water, 2014-2019\nAuthors: Haley, B. M.; Sun, Y.; Jagai, J. S.; Leibler, J. H.; Fulweiler, R.; Ashmore, J.; Wellenius, G. A.; Heiger-Bernays, W.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297573\nBackgroundCombined sewer overflow (CSO) events release untreated wastewater into surface waterbodies during heavy precipitation or snowmelt. Combined sewer systems serve approximately 40 million people in the United States, primarily in urban and suburban municipalities in the Midwest and Northeast. Predicted increases in heavy precipitation events driven by climate change underscore the importance of quantifying potential health risks associated with CSO events. ObjectivesThe aims of this study were: to 1) estimate the association between CSO events (2014-2019) and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) among Massachusetts municipalities that border a CSO-impacted river, and 2) determine if associations differ by municipal drinking water source. MethodsA case time series design was used to estimate the association between daily cumulative upstream CSO discharge in the prior four days and ED visits for AGI, adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and precipitation. Associations between CSO events and AGI were also compared by municipal drinking water source (CSO-impacted river vs. other sources). ResultsExtreme upstream CSO discharge events (\u003e95th percentile by cumulative volume) were associated with a cumulative risk ratio (CRR) of AGI of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.42) over the next four days for all municipalities, and the association was robust after adjusting for precipitation (1.17 [0.98, 1.39]). In municipalities with CSO-impacted drinking water sources, the adjusted association was somewhat less pronounced following 95th percentile CSO events (1.05 [0.82, 1.33]). The adjusted CRR of AGI was 1.62 in all municipalities following 99th percentile CSO events (95% CI: 1.04, 2.51) and not meaningfully different across strata defined by drinking water source. DiscussionIn municipalities bordering a CSO-impacted river in Massachusetts, extreme CSO events are associated with higher risk of AGI within four days. The largest CSO events are associated with increased risk of AGI regardless of drinking water source.\nAssociation Between COVID-19 During Pregnancy and Preterm Birth by Trimester of Infection: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using Longitudinal Social Media Data\nAuthors: Klein, A. Z.; Kunatharaju, S.; Golder, S.; Levine, L. D.; Figueiredo, J. C.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298696\nBackground: Preterm birth, defined as birth at \u003c37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [\u0026ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020 (i.e., without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy). We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36). Results: Through August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.\nEstimating Between Country Migration in Pneumococcal Populations\nAuthors: Belman, S.; Pesonen, H.; Croucher, N.; Bentley, S. D.; Corander, J.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.23298520\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a globally distributed, human obligate opportunistic bacterial pathogen which, although often carried commensally, is also a significant cause of invasive disease. Apart from multi-drug resistant and virulent clones, the rate and direction of pneumococcal dissemination between different countries remains largely unknown. The ability for the pneumococcus to take a foothold in a country depends on existing population configuration, the extent of vaccine implementation, as well as human mobility since it is a human obligate bacterium. To shed light on its international movement, we used extensive genome data from the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project and estimated migration parameters between multiple countries in Africa. Data on allele frequencies of polymorphisms at housekeeping-like loci for multiple different lineages circulating in the populations of South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, and The Gambia were used to calculate the fixation index Fst between countries. We then further used these summaries to fit migration coalescent models with the likelihood-free inference algorithms available in the ELFI software package. Synthetic data were additionally used to validate the inference approach. Our results demonstrate country-pair specific migration patterns and heterogeneity in the extent of migration between different lineages. Our approach demonstrates that coalescent models can be effectively used for inferring migration rates for bacterial species and lineages provided sufficiently granular population genomics surveillance data. Further it can demonstrate the connectivity of respiratory disease agents between countries to inform intervention policy in the longer term.\nThe Medical Impact of Emergent Banning of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)- contaminated Antihypertensive Drug: A nationwide longitudinal cohort study\nAuthors: Ahn, J.; Won, S.; Park, J.-H.; Shimbo, D.; Lee, H.-Y.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.23297897\nOBJECTIVETo study the association of NDMA-contaminated generic valsartan with cancer incidence. DESIGNNationwide longitudinal observational cohort study. SETTINGClaims data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea was analyzed using 1:1:1 pairwise propensity score matching (PSM) of NDMA-uncontaminated original, NDMA-contaminated generic, and initially-suspended-but-finally confirmed as NDMA-uncontaminated generic valsartan user-groups. Time-dependent Cox models and dose- response evaluation were used to evaluate carcinogenicity. PARTICIPANTSA total of 3,231,212 participants with satisfactory minimal adherence, followed up from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONSAt least one tablet of valsartan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was primary cancer incidence and secondary outcome was 12 prevalent organ-specific cancer incidences. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks were estimated before and after valsartan withdrawal. RESULTSAmong participants (mean [standard deviation] age 59.5 [13.1] years; male, 53.5%), new users had adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.069 (1.054 to 1.085) and 1.142 (1.100 to 1.186) for any cancer in the NDMA-exposed period (versus NDMA-unexposed) before and after 1:1:1 PSM, respectively. Regardless of PSM, lung and prostate cancer risks increased significantly during the NDMA-exposed period whereas, post-PSM, cancer risk did not increase in the eventually-NDMA-uncontaminated group, even in new users. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not differ significantly with NDMA exposure before and after emergent banning. CONCLUSIONSNDMA-contaminated valsartan increased cancer risk, especially of lung and prostate cancers. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not evidently increase following banning. This supports emergent health-policy action against potentially carcinogenic drugs.\nASSESSMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COVID-19 RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: RESULTS FROM A NATURAL EXPERIMENT\nAuthors: Sekendiz, Z.; Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Carr, M. A.; Fontana, A.; Mehta, N.; Ali, A.; Jiang, E.; Luft, B. J.\nScore: 1187.1, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nMuscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities is associated with multimorbidity burden in older adults: the Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA)\nAuthors: Mau, T.; Blackwell, T. L.; Cawthon, P. M.; Molina, A. J. A.; Coen, P. M.; Distefano, G.; Kramer, P. A.; Ramos, S. V.; Forman, D. E.; Goodpaster, B. H.; Toledo, F. G. S.; Duchowny, K. A.; Sparks, L. M.; Newman, A. B.; Kritchevsky, S. B.; Cummings, S. R.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298175\nBackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity. MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3+ conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions. ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI+CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

J.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295626\nIntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions. Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1.

MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.

ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.

ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and cases are continuing to rise globally. In particular, islands in the Caribbean have experienced more frequent outbreaks, and all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been reported in the region, leading to hyperendemicity and increased rates of severe disease. However, there is significant variability regarding virus surveillance and reporting between islands, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the epidemiological patterns in the Caribbean. To investigate this, we used travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology to reconstruct outbreak dynamics, DENV serotype turnover, and patterns of spread within the region from 2009-2022. We uncovered two recent DENV-3 introductions from Asia, one of which resulted in a large outbreak in Cuba, which was previously under-reported. We also show that while outbreaks can be synchronized between islands, they are often caused by different serotypes. Our study highlights the importance of surveillance of infected travelers to provide a snapshot of local introductions and transmission in areas with limited local surveillance and suggests that the recent DENV-3 introductions may pose a major public health threat in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCombined sewer overflow (CSO) events release untreated wastewater into surface waterbodies during heavy precipitation or snowmelt. Combined sewer systems serve approximately 40 million people in the United States, primarily in urban and suburban municipalities in the Midwest and Northeast. Predicted increases in heavy precipitation events driven by climate change underscore the importance of quantifying potential health risks associated with CSO events.

ObjectivesThe aims of this study were: to 1) estimate the association between CSO events (2014-2019) and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) among Massachusetts municipalities that border a CSO-impacted river, and 2) determine if associations differ by municipal drinking water source.

MethodsA case time series design was used to estimate the association between daily cumulative upstream CSO discharge in the prior four days and ED visits for AGI, adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and precipitation. Associations between CSO events and AGI were also compared by municipal drinking water source (CSO-impacted river vs. other sources).

ResultsExtreme upstream CSO discharge events (&gt;95th percentile by cumulative volume) were associated with a cumulative risk ratio (CRR) of AGI of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.42) over the next four days for all municipalities, and the association was robust after adjusting for precipitation (1.17 [0.98, 1.39]). In municipalities with CSO-impacted drinking water sources, the adjusted association was somewhat less pronounced following 95th percentile CSO events (1.05 [0.82, 1.33]). The adjusted CRR of AGI was 1.62 in all municipalities following 99th percentile CSO events (95% CI: 1.04, 2.51) and not meaningfully different across strata defined by drinking water source.

DiscussionIn municipalities bordering a CSO-impacted river in Massachusetts, extreme CSO events are associated with higher risk of AGI within four days. The largest CSO events are associated with increased risk of AGI regardless of drinking water source.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Preterm birth, defined as birth at &lt;37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of neonatal death globally and, together with low birthweight, the second leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&amp;ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020 (i.e., without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy). We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36). Results: Through August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a globally distributed, human obligate opportunistic bacterial pathogen which, although often carried commensally, is also a significant cause of invasive disease. Apart from multi-drug resistant and virulent clones, the rate and direction of pneumococcal dissemination between different countries remains largely unknown. The ability for the pneumococcus to take a foothold in a country depends on existing population configuration, the extent of vaccine implementation, as well as human mobility since it is a human obligate bacterium. To shed light on its international movement, we used extensive genome data from the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project and estimated migration parameters between multiple countries in Africa. Data on allele frequencies of polymorphisms at housekeeping-like loci for multiple different lineages circulating in the populations of South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, and The Gambia were used to calculate the fixation index Fst between countries. We then further used these summaries to fit migration coalescent models with the likelihood-free inference algorithms available in the ELFI software package. Synthetic data were additionally used to validate the inference approach. Our results demonstrate country-pair specific migration patterns and heterogeneity in the extent of migration between different lineages. Our approach demonstrates that coalescent models can be effectively used for inferring migration rates for bacterial species and lineages provided sufficiently granular population genomics surveillance data. Further it can demonstrate the connectivity of respiratory disease agents between countries to inform intervention policy in the longer term.</p>

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo study the association of NDMA-contaminated generic valsartan with cancer incidence.

DESIGNNationwide longitudinal observational cohort study.

SETTINGClaims data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea was analyzed using 1:1:1 pairwise propensity score matching (PSM) of NDMA-uncontaminated original, NDMA-contaminated generic, and initially-suspended-but-finally confirmed as NDMA-uncontaminated generic valsartan user-groups. Time-dependent Cox models and dose- response evaluation were used to evaluate carcinogenicity.

PARTICIPANTSA total of 3,231,212 participants with satisfactory minimal adherence, followed up from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2020.

INTERVENTIONSAt least one tablet of valsartan.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe primary outcome was primary cancer incidence and secondary outcome was 12 prevalent organ-specific cancer incidences. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks were estimated before and after valsartan withdrawal.

RESULTSAmong participants (mean [standard deviation] age 59.5 [13.1] years; male, 53.5%), new users had adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.069 (1.054 to 1.085) and 1.142 (1.100 to 1.186) for any cancer in the NDMA-exposed period (versus NDMA-unexposed) before and after 1:1:1 PSM, respectively. Regardless of PSM, lung and prostate cancer risks increased significantly during the NDMA-exposed period whereas, post-PSM, cancer risk did not increase in the eventually-NDMA-uncontaminated group, even in new users. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not differ significantly with NDMA exposure before and after emergent banning.

CONCLUSIONSNDMA-contaminated valsartan increased cancer risk, especially of lung and prostate cancers. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality did not evidently increase following banning. This supports emergent health-policy action against potentially carcinogenic drugs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe geroscience hypothesis posits that aging biological processes contribute to many age-related deficits, including the accumulation of multiple chronic diseases. Though only one facet of mitochondrial function, declines in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities may contribute to this increased susceptibility to multimorbidity.

MethodsThe Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) assessed ex vivo muscle mitochondrial energetics in 764 older adults (mean age =76.4, 56.5% women, 85.9% non-Hispanic white) by high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized muscle fibers. We estimated the proportional odds ratio (POR [95%CI]) for the likelihood of greater multimorbidity (four levels: 0 conditions, N=332; 1 condition, N=299; 2 conditions, N=98; or 3&#43; conditions, N=35) from an index of 11 conditions, per SD decrement in muscle mitochondrial energetic parameters. Distribution of conditions allowed for testing the associations of maximal muscle energetics with some individual conditions.

ResultsLower oxidative phosphorylation supported by fatty acids and/or complex-I and -II linked carbohydrates (e.g., Max OXPHOSCI&#43;CII) was associated with a greater multimorbidity index score (POR=1.32[1.13,1.54]) and separately with diabetes mellitus (OR=1.62[1.26,2.09]), depressive symptoms (OR=1.45[1.04,2.00]) and possibly chronic kidney disease (OR=1.57[0.98,2.52]) but not significantly with other conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

ConclusionsLower muscle mitochondrial bioenergetic capacities was associated with a worse composite multimorbidity index score. Our results suggest that decrements in muscle mitochondrial energetics may contribute to a greater global burden of disease and is more strongly related to some conditions than others.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions.

Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.</p>
