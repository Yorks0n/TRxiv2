In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,461 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. Our primary outcome measure was a PASC computable phenotype. Secondary outcomes were the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.01). However, its effect varied across the cognitive (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.90), fatigue (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), and respiratory (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.02) symptom clusters, suggesting that Paxlovid treatment may help prevent post-acute cognitive and fatigue symptoms more than others.\nInfluence of Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection on COVID-19 Severity: Evidence from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative\nAuthors: Hendrix, N.; Sidky, H.; Sahner, D.; N3C Consortium, Score: 1051.7, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.23293612\nBackgroundA large share of SARS-CoV-2 infections now occur among previously infected individuals. In this study, we sought to determine whether prior infection modifies disease severity relative to no prior infection. MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a nationwide collection of de-identified electronic health records. We used nested logistic regressions of monthly cohorts weighted on the inverse probability of prior infection to assess risk of hospitalization, death, and increased severity in the first versus second infection cohorts. ResultsWe included a total of 2,058,274 individuals in the analysis, 147,592 of whom had two recorded infections. The impact of prior infection differed meaningfully between months. Prior infection was largely protective prior to March 2022, with odds ratios (ORs) as low as 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.51 to 0.86) in November 2021 for hospitalization. and as low as 0.23 (0.06 to 0.86) in June 2021 for death. However, prior infection was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death, mostly after March 2022 when the ORs were as high as 1.87 (1.26 to 2.80) and 2.99 (1.65 to 5.41) in April 2022, respectively. The overall OR for more severe disease was 1.06 (1.03 to 1.10) among previously infected individuals. ConclusionIn the pandemics first two years, previously infected patients generally had less severe disease than people without prior infection. During the Omicron era, however, previously infected patients had the same or worse severity of disease as patients without prior infection.\nMR-link-2: pleiotropy robust cis Mendelian randomization validated in four independent gold-standard datasets of causality\nAuthors: van der Graaf, A.; Warmerdam, R.; Auwerx, C. M. P.; eQTLGen Consortium, ; Vosa, U.; Borges, M. C.; Franke, L.; Kutalik, Z.\nScore: 32.7, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.24301400\nMendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures. To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.\nDeaths induced by compassionate use of hydroxychloroquine during the first COVID-19 wave: the devil is in the details.\nAuthors: Beaudart, C.; Douxfils, J.; Musuamba, F.; Dogne, J.-M.\nScore: 165.5, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301464\nSeveral trials of different designs were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and/or the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ. We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at \u003c or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses \u003c or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality. Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.\nHealthy lifestyle for the prevention of post-COVID-19 multisystem sequelae, hospitalization, and death: a prospective cohort study\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Su, B.; Alcalde-Herraiz, M.; Barclay, N. L.; Tian, Y.; Li, C.; Wareham, N. J.; Paredes, R.; Xie, J.; PRIETO-ALHAMBRA, D.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24302040\nBackgroundPost-COVID complications are emerging as a global public health crisis. Effective prevention strategies are needed to inform patients, clinicians and policy makers, and to reduce their cumulative burden. We aimed to investigate whether a habitual healthy lifestyle predated pandemic is associated with lower risks of multisystem sequelae and other adverse outcomes of COVID-19, and whether the potential protective effects are independent of pre-existing comorbidities. MethodsThe prospective population-based cohort study enrolled participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction test result between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2022. Participants with no history of the related outcome one year before infection were included and followed up for 210 days. Exposures included ten modifiable healthy lifestyle factors including past or never smoking, moderate alcohol intake ([\u0026le;]4 times week), body mass index \u003c30 kg/m2, at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, less sedentary time (\u003c4 hours per day), healthy sleep duration (7-9 hours per day), adequate intake of fruit and vegetables ([\u0026ge;]400 g/day), adequate oily fish intake ([\u0026ge;]1 portion/week), moderate intake of red meat ([\u0026le;]4 portions week) and processed meat ([\u0026le;]4 portions week). Outcomes included multisystem COVID-19 sequelae (consisting of 75 diseases/symptoms in 10 organ systems), death, and hospital admission following SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by hospital inpatient and death records. Risk was reported in relative scale (hazard ratio [HR]) and absolute scale (absolute risk reduction [ARR]) during both the acute (the first 30 days) and post-acute (30-210 days) phases of infection using Cox models. FindingsA total of 68,896 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [8.4]; 32,098 women [46.6%]) with COVID-19 were included. A favorable lifestyle (6-10 healthy lifestyle factors; 46.4%) was associated with a 36% lower risk of multisystem sequelae of COVID-19 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.69; ARR, 7.08%; 95% CI, 5.98-8.09), compared with unfavorable lifestyle (0-4 factors; 12.3%). Risk reductions were observed across all 10 prespecified organ systems including cardiovascular, coagulation, metabolic and endocrine, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and respiratory disorders, and general symptoms of fatigue and malaise. This beneficial effect was largely attributable to direct effects of healthy lifestyle, with mediation proportion ranging from 44% to 93% across organ systems. A favorable lifestyle was also associated with lower risk of post-COVID death (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52-0.66; ARR, 1.99%; 95% CI, 1.61-2.32) and hospitalization (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; ARR, 6.14%; 95% CI, 4.48-7.68). These associations were observed after accounting for potential misclassification of lifestyle factors, and during acute and post-acute infection, in those tested positive in the hospital and community setting, and independent of vaccination status or SARS-CoV-2 variant. InterpretationAdherence to a healthy lifestyle predated pandemic was associated with substantially lower risk of complications across organ systems, death, and hospitalization following COVID-19, regardless of phases of infection, vaccination status, test setting, and SARS-CoV-2 variants, and independent of comorbidities. These findings illustrate the benefits of adhering to a healthy lifestyle to reduce the long-term adverse health consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between March 1, 2020, and December 1, 2023, using the search terms \"healthy lifestyle\", \"risk factor\", \"post-COVID condition\", \"long COVID\", \"post-acute sequelae\", \"prevention\", \"management\", and \"treatment\", with no language restrictions. Previous evidence on the prevention and management of long COVID has mainly focused on vaccination and pharmaceutical approaches, including antivirals (e.g., molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir) and other drugs (e.g., metformin). Vaccination before infection or use of antivirals in selected high-risk patients during acute infection only partially mediates the risk of COVID-19 sequelae. Evidence for the non-pharmaceutical prevention strategies are lacking. We identified only two publications on the association between healthy lifestyle and post-COVID condition, and one meta-analysis of the risk factors for long COVID symptoms. A cross-sectional study of 1981 women suggested an inverse association between healthy lifestyle factors and self-reported symptoms following infection of non-Omicron variants, which was mainly driven by BMI and sleep duration. Another study suggested an inverse prospective association between healthy lifestyle prior to infection and post-COVID cardiovascular events. High BMI and smoking are risk factors for long COVID mainly in hospitalized patients. We did not find any study that assessed the association between a composite healthy lifestyle and subsequent post-COVID complications or sequelae across organ systems, hospitalization, and death. Added value of this studyIn a prospective, population-based cohort of 68,896 participants with COVID-19, adherence to a healthy lifestyle prior to infection was associated with a substantially lower risk of multisystem sequelae (by 20%-36%), death (by 26%-41%), and hospital admission (by 13%-22%) following COVID-19. The reduced risk of sequelae was evident across 10 prespecified organ systems, including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, metabolic and endocrine, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and respiratory disorders, as well as general symptoms of fatigue and malaise. The reduced risk of multisystem sequelae, hospitalization, and death associated with a healthy lifestyle was consistently observed across participants, regardless of their vaccination status, disease severity, and major SARS-CoV-2 variants, and largely independent of relevant comorbidities. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle prior to infection was consistently and directly associated with reduced risk of sequelae and other adverse health outcomes following COVID-19. Implications of all the available evidenceThe inverse association of healthy lifestyle with multisystem sequelae was even larger than those observed in previous studies of pharmaceutical interventions in non-hospitalized patients. Considering the restricted scope of currently available therapies, such as antivirals (only selected patients at higher risk are qualified during the acute infection) and limited efficacy of vaccination in preventing long COVID, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, in combination with vaccination and, if necessary, potential medications, emerges as practical prevention and care strategies to mitigate the long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These strategies are of significant clinical and public health importance in reducing the overall burden of post-COVID conditions and improving preparedness for future pandemics.\nSocioeconomic correlates of urban mobility trends in two Australian cities during transitional periods of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Kollepara, P.; Dey, S.; Tomko, M.; Martino, E.; Bentley, R.; Tizzoni, M.; Geard, N.; Zachreson, C.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302105\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, both government-mandated lockdowns and discretionary changes in behaviour combined to produce dramatic and abrupt changes to human mobility patterns. To understand the socioeconomic determinants of intervention compliance and discretionary behavioural responses to epidemic threats, we investigate whether changes in human mobility showed a systematic variation with socioeconomic status during two distinct periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. We analyse mobility data from two major urban centres and compare the trends during mandated stay-at-home policies and after the full relaxation of NPIs, which coincided with a large surge of COVID-19 cases. We analyse data aggregated from de-identified GPS trajectories, collated from providers of mobile phone applications and aggregated to small spatial regions. Our results demonstrate systematic decreases in mobility relative to pre-pandemic baseline with the Index of Education and Occupation, for both pandemic periods. On the other hand, the Index of Economic Resources was not correlated with mobility changes. This result contrasts with observations from other national contexts, where reductions in mobility typically increased strongly with indicators of wealth. We interpret these findings in the context of the economic policies put in place by Australian authorities to subsidise household incomes and maintain the essential workforce.\nEstimated number of lives directly saved by COVID-19 vaccination programs in the WHO European Region, December 2020 to March 2023\nAuthors: Mesle, M. M.; Brown, J.; Mook, P.; Katz, M. A.; Hagan, J.; Pastore, R.; Nitzan, D.; Benka, B.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Bossuyt, N.; Stouten, V.; Vernemmen, C.; Constantinou, E.; Kyncl, J.; Maly, M.; Sanca, O.; Grove Krause, T.; Skafte Vestergaard, L.; Leino, T.; Poukka, E.; Gkolfinopoulou, K.; Mellou, K.; Maria Tsintziloni, M.; Molnar, Z.; Aspelund, G.; Thordardottir, M.; Domegan, L.; Kelly, E.; O'Donell, J.; Sacco, C.; Riccardo, F.; Mateo Urdiales, A.; Bumsteinas, V.; Liausediene, R.; Mossong, J.; Vergison, A.; Borg, M.-L.; Melillo, T.; Kocinski, D.; Pollozhani, E.; Meijerink, H.; Costa, D.; Pa\nScore: 761.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301206\nBackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter \"CAT\") reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023. MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths. FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [\u0026ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [\u0026ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [\u0026ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period. InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures. FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest. Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [\u0026ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [\u0026ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [\u0026ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967). Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.\nCharacteristics and completeness of reporting of systematic reviews of prevalence studies in adult populations: a meta-epidemiological study.\nAuthors: Buitrago-Garcia, D.; Robles-Rodriguez, W. G.; Eslava-Schmalbach, J. H.; Salanti, G.; Low, N.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302077\nBackgroundThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, first published in 2009, has been widely endorsed, and compliance is high in systematic reviews of intervention studies. Systematic reviews of prevalence studies are increasing in frequency, but their characteristics and reporting quality have not been examined in large studies. ObjectiveTo describe the characteristics of systematic reviews of prevalence studies in adults, evaluate the completeness of reporting, according to the PRISMA 2009 checklist, and explore which publication characteristics are associated with the completeness of reporting. Study designWe did a meta-epidemiological study. We searched 5 databases from January 2010 to December 2020 to identify systematic reviews of prevalence studies in adult populations. We used the PRISMA 2009 checklist to assess completeness of reporting and recorded additional characteristics. We conducted a descriptive analysis of review characteristics and linear regression to assess the relationship between compliance with PRISMA and publication characteristics. ResultsWe included 1172 systematic reviews of prevalence studies. The number of reviews increased from 25 published in 2010 to 273 in 2020. The median PRISMA score for systematic reviews was 17.5 out of 23 maximum and, for systematic reviews with meta-analysis, 22 out of 25 maximum. Completeness of reporting, particularly for key items in the methods section was suboptimal. Systematic reviews published more recently, that included more co-authors, that included a meta-analysis, used a reporting or conduct guideline, or were published in an open access journal were associated with increased compliance with PRISMA 2009. ConclusionsThis study highlights aspects of systematic reviews for prevalence studies for which special attention is needed. Development of a specific tool to assess the risk of bias in prevalence studies and an extension to the PRISMA statement could improve the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews of prevalence studies.\nPrevalence of Falciparum and non-Falciparum Malaria in the 2014-15 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey\nAuthors: Gaither, C.; Morgan, C.; Kirby, R.; Karema, C.; Gashema, P.; White, S.; Topazian, H. M.; Giesbrecht, D. J.; Thwai, K.; Boyter, K.; Munyaneza, T.; Mambo Muvunyi, C.; De Dieu Butera, J.; Bailey, J. A.; Mazarati, J.-B.; Juliano, J. J.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301054\nBackgroundMalaria remains a major cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs. MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors. ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria. ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.\nInferring the sensitivity of wastewater metagenomic sequencing for pathogen early detection\nAuthors: Grimm, S. L.; Kaufman, J. T.; Rice, D. P.; Whittaker, C.; Bradshaw, W. J.; McLaren, M. R.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300450\nDetecting novel pathogens at an early stage requires robust early warning that is both sensitive and pathogen-agnostic. Wastewater metagenomic sequencing (W-MGS) could meet these goals, but its sensitivity and financial feasibility depend on the relative abundance of novel pathogen sequences in W-MGS data. Here we collate W-MGS data from a diverse range of studies to characterize the relative abundance of known viruses in wastewater. We then develop a Bayesian statistical model to integrate these data with epidemiological estimates for 13 human-infecting viruses, and use it to estimate the expected relative abundance of different viral pathogens for a given prevalence or incidence in the community. Our results reveal pronounced variation between studies, with estimates differing by one to three orders of magnitude for the same pathogen: for example, the expected relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 at 1% weekly incidence varied between 10-7 and 10-10. Integrating these estimates with a simple cost model highlights similarly wide inter-study and inter-pathogen variation in the cost of W-MGS-based early detection, with a mean yearly cost estimate of roughly $19,000 for a Norovirus-like pathogen and $2.9 million for a SARS-CoV-2-like pathogen at 1% incidence. The model and parameter estimates presented here represent an important resource for future investigation into the performance of wastewater MGS, and can be extended to incorporate new wastewater datasets as they become available.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. In this study, we examined whether treatment with Paxlovid in the acute phase of COVID-19 helps prevent the onset of PASC. We used electronic health records from the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 426,461 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation (TTE) framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. Our primary outcome measure was a PASC computable phenotype. Secondary outcomes were the onset of novel cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment did not have a significant effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.01). However, its effect varied across the cognitive (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.90), fatigue (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), and respiratory (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.02) symptom clusters, suggesting that Paxlovid treatment may help prevent post-acute cognitive and fatigue symptoms more than others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundA large share of SARS-CoV-2 infections now occur among previously infected individuals. In this study, we sought to determine whether prior infection modifies disease severity relative to no prior infection.

MethodsWe used data from first and second COVID-19 episodes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, a nationwide collection of de-identified electronic health records. We used nested logistic regressions of monthly cohorts weighted on the inverse probability of prior infection to assess risk of hospitalization, death, and increased severity in the first versus second infection cohorts.

ResultsWe included a total of 2,058,274 individuals in the analysis, 147,592 of whom had two recorded infections. The impact of prior infection differed meaningfully between months. Prior infection was largely protective prior to March 2022, with odds ratios (ORs) as low as 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.51 to 0.86) in November 2021 for hospitalization. and as low as 0.23 (0.06 to 0.86) in June 2021 for death. However, prior infection was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death, mostly after March 2022 when the ORs were as high as 1.87 (1.26 to 2.80) and 2.99 (1.65 to 5.41) in April 2022, respectively. The overall OR for more severe disease was 1.06 (1.03 to 1.10) among previously infected individuals.

ConclusionIn the pandemics first two years, previously infected patients generally had less severe disease than people without prior infection. During the Omicron era, however, previously infected patients had the same or worse severity of disease as patients without prior infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures. To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several trials of different designs were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the prevention and/or the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Recently, it has been reported that HCQ might have been associated with an excess of 16,990 deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 6 countries. Such attributable risk analysis is associated with many limitations. These previous findings did not adequately address dose-subgroup and sensitivity analyses which precludes any overall firm conclusions on in-hospital mortality attributable to HCQ.

We performed a meta-analysis and proposed a stratification by doses of HCQ. By pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days (i.e., k=12, n patients treated with HCQ=947, n controls=745), an OR of 0.94 (95%CI 0.56; 1.59) was found, indicating no increase in the mortality rate anymore. Importantly, there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with HCQ at &lt; or = 2400mg/5 days neither. The same observation held true when pooling studies employing HCQ doses &lt; or = 4800mg/5 days (i.e., k=25, n patients treated with HCQ=1672, n controls=1479) with an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.73; 1.29). Only high dose regimens of HCQ are associated with a significant increase in mortality.

Applying an excess of mortality in the population treated with doses where no increase of mortality is found creates a misleading overestimation of deaths associated with the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, even at low doses HCQ regimen, no reduction in mortality with HCQ was observed suggesting that, when it comes to mortality as the outcome, HCQ did not show a benefit in hospitalized patients suffering from COVID-19. This mainly justifies the past and still up-to-date recommendations and guidelines to not use HCQ in this indication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPost-COVID complications are emerging as a global public health crisis. Effective prevention strategies are needed to inform patients, clinicians and policy makers, and to reduce their cumulative burden. We aimed to investigate whether a habitual healthy lifestyle predated pandemic is associated with lower risks of multisystem sequelae and other adverse outcomes of COVID-19, and whether the potential protective effects are independent of pre-existing comorbidities.

MethodsThe prospective population-based cohort study enrolled participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction test result between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2022. Participants with no history of the related outcome one year before infection were included and followed up for 210 days. Exposures included ten modifiable healthy lifestyle factors including past or never smoking, moderate alcohol intake ([&amp;le;]4 times week), body mass index &lt;30 kg/m2, at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, less sedentary time (&lt;4 hours per day), healthy sleep duration (7-9 hours per day), adequate intake of fruit and vegetables ([&amp;ge;]400 g/day), adequate oily fish intake ([&amp;ge;]1 portion/week), moderate intake of red meat ([&amp;le;]4 portions week) and processed meat ([&amp;le;]4 portions week). Outcomes included multisystem COVID-19 sequelae (consisting of 75 diseases/symptoms in 10 organ systems), death, and hospital admission following SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by hospital inpatient and death records. Risk was reported in relative scale (hazard ratio [HR]) and absolute scale (absolute risk reduction [ARR]) during both the acute (the first 30 days) and post-acute (30-210 days) phases of infection using Cox models.

FindingsA total of 68,896 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.6 [8.4]; 32,098 women [46.6%]) with COVID-19 were included. A favorable lifestyle (6-10 healthy lifestyle factors; 46.4%) was associated with a 36% lower risk of multisystem sequelae of COVID-19 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.69; ARR, 7.08%; 95% CI, 5.98-8.09), compared with unfavorable lifestyle (0-4 factors; 12.3%). Risk reductions were observed across all 10 prespecified organ systems including cardiovascular, coagulation, metabolic and endocrine, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and respiratory disorders, and general symptoms of fatigue and malaise. This beneficial effect was largely attributable to direct effects of healthy lifestyle, with mediation proportion ranging from 44% to 93% across organ systems. A favorable lifestyle was also associated with lower risk of post-COVID death (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52-0.66; ARR, 1.99%; 95% CI, 1.61-2.32) and hospitalization (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; ARR, 6.14%; 95% CI, 4.48-7.68). These associations were observed after accounting for potential misclassification of lifestyle factors, and during acute and post-acute infection, in those tested positive in the hospital and community setting, and independent of vaccination status or SARS-CoV-2 variant.

InterpretationAdherence to a healthy lifestyle predated pandemic was associated with substantially lower risk of complications across organ systems, death, and hospitalization following COVID-19, regardless of phases of infection, vaccination status, test setting, and SARS-CoV-2 variants, and independent of comorbidities. These findings illustrate the benefits of adhering to a healthy lifestyle to reduce the long-term adverse health consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and MEDLINE for articles published between March 1, 2020, and December 1, 2023, using the search terms &#34;healthy lifestyle&#34;, &#34;risk factor&#34;, &#34;post-COVID condition&#34;, &#34;long COVID&#34;, &#34;post-acute sequelae&#34;, &#34;prevention&#34;, &#34;management&#34;, and &#34;treatment&#34;, with no language restrictions. Previous evidence on the prevention and management of long COVID has mainly focused on vaccination and pharmaceutical approaches, including antivirals (e.g., molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir) and other drugs (e.g., metformin). Vaccination before infection or use of antivirals in selected high-risk patients during acute infection only partially mediates the risk of COVID-19 sequelae. Evidence for the non-pharmaceutical prevention strategies are lacking. We identified only two publications on the association between healthy lifestyle and post-COVID condition, and one meta-analysis of the risk factors for long COVID symptoms. A cross-sectional study of 1981 women suggested an inverse association between healthy lifestyle factors and self-reported symptoms following infection of non-Omicron variants, which was mainly driven by BMI and sleep duration. Another study suggested an inverse prospective association between healthy lifestyle prior to infection and post-COVID cardiovascular events. High BMI and smoking are risk factors for long COVID mainly in hospitalized patients. We did not find any study that assessed the association between a composite healthy lifestyle and subsequent post-COVID complications or sequelae across organ systems, hospitalization, and death.

Added value of this studyIn a prospective, population-based cohort of 68,896 participants with COVID-19, adherence to a healthy lifestyle prior to infection was associated with a substantially lower risk of multisystem sequelae (by 20%-36%), death (by 26%-41%), and hospital admission (by 13%-22%) following COVID-19. The reduced risk of sequelae was evident across 10 prespecified organ systems, including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, metabolic and endocrine, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and respiratory disorders, as well as general symptoms of fatigue and malaise. The reduced risk of multisystem sequelae, hospitalization, and death associated with a healthy lifestyle was consistently observed across participants, regardless of their vaccination status, disease severity, and major SARS-CoV-2 variants, and largely independent of relevant comorbidities. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle prior to infection was consistently and directly associated with reduced risk of sequelae and other adverse health outcomes following COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe inverse association of healthy lifestyle with multisystem sequelae was even larger than those observed in previous studies of pharmaceutical interventions in non-hospitalized patients. Considering the restricted scope of currently available therapies, such as antivirals (only selected patients at higher risk are qualified during the acute infection) and limited efficacy of vaccination in preventing long COVID, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, in combination with vaccination and, if necessary, potential medications, emerges as practical prevention and care strategies to mitigate the long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These strategies are of significant clinical and public health importance in reducing the overall burden of post-COVID conditions and improving preparedness for future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the COVID-19 pandemic, both government-mandated lockdowns and discretionary changes in behaviour combined to produce dramatic and abrupt changes to human mobility patterns. To understand the socioeconomic determinants of intervention compliance and discretionary behavioural responses to epidemic threats, we investigate whether changes in human mobility showed a systematic variation with socioeconomic status during two distinct periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. We analyse mobility data from two major urban centres and compare the trends during mandated stay-at-home policies and after the full relaxation of NPIs, which coincided with a large surge of COVID-19 cases. We analyse data aggregated from de-identified GPS trajectories, collated from providers of mobile phone applications and aggregated to small spatial regions. Our results demonstrate systematic decreases in mobility relative to pre-pandemic baseline with the Index of Education and Occupation, for both pandemic periods. On the other hand, the Index of Economic Resources was not correlated with mobility changes. This result contrasts with observations from other national contexts, where reductions in mobility typically increased strongly with indicators of wealth. We interpret these findings in the context of the economic policies put in place by Australian authorities to subsidise household incomes and maintain the essential workforce.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBy March 2023, 54 countries, areas and territories (thereafter &#34;CAT&#34;) reported over 2.2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe (1). Here, we estimate how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the Region, from December 2020 through March 2023.

MethodsWe estimated the number of lives directly saved by age-group, vaccine dose and circulating Variant of Concern (VOC) period, both regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and COVID-19 vaccine uptake reported by 34 CAT, and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from the literature. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

FindingsWe found that vaccines reduced deaths by 57% overall (CAT range: 15% to 75%), representing [~]1.4 million lives saved in those aged [&amp;ge;]25 years (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million): 96% of lives saved were aged [&amp;ge;]60 years and 52% were aged [&amp;ge;]80 years; first boosters saved 51%, and 67% were saved during the Omicron period.

InterpretationOver nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccinationwere in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among these most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

FundingThis work was supported by a US Centers for Disease Control cooperative agreement (Grant number 6 NU511P000936-02-020), who had no role in data analysis or interpretation.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince first identified in late 2019, COVID-19 has caused disproportionately high mortality rates in older adults. With the rapid development and licensing of novel COVID-19 vaccines, immunization campaigns across the WHO European Region started in late 2020 and early 2021, initially targeting the most vulnerable and exposed populations, including older adults, people with comorbidities and healthcare professionals. Several studies have estimated the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination, both at national and multi-country level in the earlier stages of the pandemic. However, only one multi-country study has assessed the number of lives saved beyond the first year of the pandemic, particularly when the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) circulated, a period when vaccination coverage was high in many countries, areas and territories (CAT), but COVID-19 transmission was at its highest.

Added value of this studyHere we quantified the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in adults by age-group, vaccine dose and period of circulation of VOC, across diverse settings, using real world data reported by 34 CAT in the WHO European Region for the period December 2020 to April 2023. We estimated that COVID-19 vaccination programs were associated with a 57% reduction (CAT range: 15% to 75%) in the number of deaths among the [&amp;ge;]25 years old, representing over 1.5 million lives saved (range: 0.7 million to 2.6 million) in 34 European CAT during the first 2.5 years following vaccine introduction. The first booster savedthe most lives (721,122 / 1,408,967, (57%) of all lives saved). The [&amp;ge;]60 years old age group accounted for 96% of the total lives saved (1,349,617 / 1,408,967) whereas the [&amp;ge;]80 years old age group represented 52% of the total lives saved (728,858 / 1,408,967 lives saved) and 67% of all lives were saved during the Omicron period (942,571 / 1,408,967).

Implications of all the available evidenceOur results reinforce the importance of up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, particularly among older age-groups. Communication campaigns supporting COVID-19 vaccination should stress the value of COVID-19 vaccination in saving lives to ensure vulnerable groups are up-to-date with vaccination ahead of periods of potential increased transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, first published in 2009, has been widely endorsed, and compliance is high in systematic reviews of intervention studies. Systematic reviews of prevalence studies are increasing in frequency, but their characteristics and reporting quality have not been examined in large studies.

ObjectiveTo describe the characteristics of systematic reviews of prevalence studies in adults, evaluate the completeness of reporting, according to the PRISMA 2009 checklist, and explore which publication characteristics are associated with the completeness of reporting.

Study designWe did a meta-epidemiological study. We searched 5 databases from January 2010 to December 2020 to identify systematic reviews of prevalence studies in adult populations. We used the PRISMA 2009 checklist to assess completeness of reporting and recorded additional characteristics. We conducted a descriptive analysis of review characteristics and linear regression to assess the relationship between compliance with PRISMA and publication characteristics.

ResultsWe included 1172 systematic reviews of prevalence studies. The number of reviews increased from 25 published in 2010 to 273 in 2020. The median PRISMA score for systematic reviews was 17.5 out of 23 maximum and, for systematic reviews with meta-analysis, 22 out of 25 maximum. Completeness of reporting, particularly for key items in the methods section was suboptimal. Systematic reviews published more recently, that included more co-authors, that included a meta-analysis, used a reporting or conduct guideline, or were published in an open access journal were associated with increased compliance with PRISMA 2009.

ConclusionsThis study highlights aspects of systematic reviews for prevalence studies for which special attention is needed. Development of a specific tool to assess the risk of bias in prevalence studies and an extension to the PRISMA statement could improve the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews of prevalence studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMalaria remains a major cause of morbidity in sub-Saharan Africa. Undetected asymptomatic falciparum malaria results in a large transmission reservoir and there is evidence of increasing non-falciparum malaria as malaria is controlled in Africa, both resulting in challenges for malaria control programs.

MethodsWe performed quantitative real time PCR for 4 malaria species in 4,596 individuals from the 2014-2015 Rwanda Demographic Health Survey. Bivariate models were used to determine species-specific associations with risk factors.

ResultsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria, P. ovale spp., and P. malariae infection had broad spatial distribution across Rwanda. P. vivax infection was rare. Overall infection prevalence was 23.6% (95%CI [21.7%, 26.0%]), with falciparum and non-falciparum at 17.6% [15.9%, 19.0%] and 8.3% [7.0%, 10.0%], respectively. Parasitemias tended to be low and mixed species infections were common, especially where malaria transmission was the highest. Falciparum infection was associated with socio-econiomic status, rural residence and low altitude. Few risk factors were associated with non-falciparum malaria.

ConclusionsAsymptomatic falciparum malaria and non-falciparum malaria are common and widely distributed across Rwanda. Continued molecular monitoring of Plasmodium spp. is needed to monitor these threats to malaria control in Africa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Detecting novel pathogens at an early stage requires robust early warning that is both sensitive and pathogen-agnostic. Wastewater metagenomic sequencing (W-MGS) could meet these goals, but its sensitivity and financial feasibility depend on the relative abundance of novel pathogen sequences in W-MGS data. Here we collate W-MGS data from a diverse range of studies to characterize the relative abundance of known viruses in wastewater. We then develop a Bayesian statistical model to integrate these data with epidemiological estimates for 13 human-infecting viruses, and use it to estimate the expected relative abundance of different viral pathogens for a given prevalence or incidence in the community. Our results reveal pronounced variation between studies, with estimates differing by one to three orders of magnitude for the same pathogen: for example, the expected relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 at 1% weekly incidence varied between 10-7 and 10-10. Integrating these estimates with a simple cost model highlights similarly wide inter-study and inter-pathogen variation in the cost of W-MGS-based early detection, with a mean yearly cost estimate of roughly $19,000 for a Norovirus-like pathogen and $2.9 million for a SARS-CoV-2-like pathogen at 1% incidence. The model and parameter estimates presented here represent an important resource for future investigation into the performance of wastewater MGS, and can be extended to incorporate new wastewater datasets as they become available.</p>
