An updated literature review and comprehensive assessment of global surveillance databases.\nAuthors: Caini, S.; Meijer, A.; Nunes, M.

Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information. MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide. ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation. DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.\nEndemic means change as SARS-CoV-2 evolves\nAuthors: Otto, S.; MacPherson, A.; Colijn, C.\nScore: 36.1, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296264\nCOVID-19 has become endemic, with dynamics that reflect the waning of immunity and re-exposure, by contrast to the epidemic phase driven by exposure in immunologically naive populations. Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.\nEffectiveness of the adjuvanted Sanofi/GSK (VidPrevtyn Beta) and Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5) bivalent vaccines against hospitalisation amongst adults aged 75 years and older in England, estimated using a test-negative case control study design.\nAuthors: Kirsebom, F. C. M.; Andrews, N.; Stowe, J.; Dabrera, G.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296290\nBackground In England, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a spring 2023 booster programme for all adults aged 75 years and older and the immunosuppressed. The vaccines advised were the Sanofi/GSK AS03-adjuvanted monovalent beta variant (VidPrevtyn Beta) booster vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5) bivalent vaccine. This is the first time an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine has been administered as part of a UK COVID-19 vaccination programme. In clinical trials, the antibody levels generated by the Sanofi/GSK vaccine were comparable to levels generated by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines but to date there are no real-world data on the effectiveness or duration of protection of this vaccine. Methods We used a test-negative case-control study design to estimate the incremental vaccine effectiveness of the Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer bivalent BA.4-5 boosters against hospitalisation amongst those aged 75 years and older in England. The study period for tests contributing to all analyses was from 3rd April 2022 to 27th August 2023. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated relative to those who had received at least two doses prior to their spring booster, with their last dose being an autumn 2022 booster given at least 3 months prior. Findings Overall, there were 14,174 eligible tests from hospitalised individuals aged 75 years and older, with 3,005 being cases and 11,169 being controls. Effectiveness against hospitalisation was highest in the period 9 to 13 days post vaccination for both manufacturers at about 50%; 43.6% (95% C.I.; 20.1 to 60.2%) and 56.4% (95% C.I; 25.8 to 74.4%) for Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5, respectively. There was some evidence of waning with a reduction to about 30% for both manufacturers 5-9 weeks post vaccination. Interpretation Together, these results provide reassuring evidence that both the adjuvanted Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5 booster vaccines provided a good boost to protection against hospitalisation amongst adults aged 75 years and older. The finding that the adjuvanted vaccine targeting the now distant Beta strain had similar effectiveness to the mRNA vaccine targeting more closely matched Omicron sub-lineages BA.4-5 during a period of Omicron circulation may reflect improved protection due to the adjuvant in the Sanofi/GSK product.

R.; Cooper, B. S.; Robotham, J. V.; Knight, G. M.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23296060\nBackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values. In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation. ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40. At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli. ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.\nProtection of second booster vaccinations and prior infection against SARS-CoV-2 in the UK SIREN healthcare worker cohort\nAuthors: Kirwan, P. D.; Hall, V. J.; Foulkes, S.; Otter, A.; Munro, K.; Sparkes, D.; Howells, A.; Platt, N.; Broad, J.; Crossman, D.; Norman, C.; Corrigan, D.; Jackson, C. H.; Cole, M.; Brown, C. S.; Atti, A.; Islam, J.; SIREN Study Group, ; Presanis, A.; Charlett, A.; De Angelis, D.; Hopkins, S.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.23296330\nBackground The protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers. Methods Participants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated. Results 1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI -11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection \u003e2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection. Conclusions Despite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern.

To fight back, several vaccine candidates are under development, with some of them undergoing the phases 2B and 3 of the development pipeline. The impact of these vaccines on the general population needs to be addressed using disease-transmission models, and, in a country like China, which last year ranked third in number of cases worldwide, and where the population is undergoing a fast process of demographic aging, the impact of TB vaccination campaigns may depend heavily upon the age of targeted populations and with the mechanistic descriptions of the TB vaccines. For these reasons, transmission models need to capture the coupling between TB dynamics and demographic evolution, as well as to be able to accommodate different mechanistic descriptions of TB vaccine protection. In this work, we studied the potential impact of a new TB vaccine in China targeting adolescents (15-19 y.o.) or elderly people (60-64 y.o.), according to varying vaccine descriptions that represent reasonable mechanisms of action leading to prevention of disease (PoD), or prevention of recurrence (PoR), each of them targetting specific routes to TB disease. To measure the influence of the description of the coupling between transmission dynamics and aging in TB transmission models, we explored two different approaches to comptute the evolution of the contact matrices, which relate to the spreading among different age strata. Our results show that the magnitude of model-based impact estimates substantially depends upon the vaccine profile, and it is also strongly related to the modeling approach chosen to describe the time evolution of contact matrices. In spite of these sources of uncertainty, our results also show, in line with previous modeling works, that elder vaccination is a suitable option in China to reduce the incidence of TB.\nDistrict Level Variation in Hypertension Epidemiology in India and Influence of Social Determinants: National Family Health Survey-5\nAuthors: Gupta, R.; Gaur, K.; Sharma, S. C.; Khedar, R. S.; Dhamija, R. K.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296421\nABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Enumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants. METHODS: We used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (\u003c30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p\u003c0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women.\nLight at night and modeled circadian disruption predict higher risk of mortality: A prospective study in \u003e88,000 participants\nAuthors: Windred, D. P.; Burns, A. C.; Lane, J. M.; Olivier, P.; Rutter, M. K.; Saxena, R.; Phillips, A. J. K.; Cain, S. W.\nScore: 32.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295231\nImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established. ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingUnited Kingdom. ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 57% female. ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data. Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{+/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking. ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality? FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in \u003e88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk. MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.\nSerological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection by vaccination status and variant in England\nAuthors: Quinot, C.; Lunt, R.; Kirsebom, F.; Andrews, N.; Whitaker, H.; Skarnes, C.; Letley, L.; Haskins, D.; Angel, C.; Firminger, S.; Ratcliffe, K.; Sheridan, A.; Rajan, S.; Akindele, L.; Ijaz, S.; Zambon, M.; Brown, K.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.\nScore: 138.1, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295073\nBackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant. MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported. ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant). ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.\nChildhood Adversity and COVID-19 Outcomes: Findings from the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Hanson, J. L.; O'Connor, K. A.; Adkins, D. J.; Kahhale, I.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.20.23287479\nObjectives. To investigate the association between childhood adversity and COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank. Design. Cohort study. Setting. United Kingdom. Participants. 151,200 participants in the UK Biobank cohort who had completed the Childhood Trauma Screen, were alive at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (01-10-2021), and were still active in the UK Biobank when hospitalization and mortality data were most recently updated (11-2021). Main outcome measures. COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality. Results. Higher self-reports of childhood adversity were related to greater likelihood of COVID-19-related hospitalization in all statistical models. In models adjusted for age, ethnicity, and sex, childhood adversity was associated with an OR of 1.227 of hospitalization (95% CI=1.153 to 1.306, Childhood Adversity z=6.49, p\u003c0.005) and an OR of 1.25 of a COVID-19 related death (95% CI=1.11 to 1.424, Childhood Adversity z=3.5, p\u003c0.005). Adjustment for potential confounds attenuated these associations, although associations remained statistically significant. Conclusions. Childhood adversity was significantly associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic and health confounders. Further research is needed to clarify the biological and psychosocial processes underlying these associations to inform public health intervention and prevention strategies to minimize COVID-19 disparities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionEarly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major drop in the number of influenza B/Yamagata detections was observed globally. Given the potential public health implications, particularly with regards to influenza vaccination, we conducted a systematic review of influenza B/Yamagata virus circulation data from multiple complementary sources of information.

MethodsWe searched articles published until 20th March 2023 in PubMed and EMBASE; examined epidemiological and virological influenza data for 2020-2023 contained in the publicly available WHO-FluNet and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) global databases, or collected by the multi-national Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) study; and looked for influenza data in the webpages of respiratory viruses surveillance systems from countries worldwide.

ResultsHighly consistent findings were found across all sources of information, with a progressive decline of influenza B/Yamagata detections from 2020 onwards across all world regions, both in absolute terms (total number of cases), the positivity rate, and as a fraction of influenza B detections. Isolated influenza B/Yamagata cases continue to be sporadically reported, and these are typically vaccine-derived, mistaken data entries or under investigation.

DiscussionWhile it is still too early to conclude that B/Yamagata is (or will soon become) extinct, the current epidemiological and virological data call for a rapid response in terms of influenza prevention practices, particularly regarding the formulation of influenza vaccines. The current epidemiological situation is unprecedented in recent decades, underlying the importance of continuously and carefully monitoring the circulation of influenza viruses (as well as SARS-CoV-2 and the other respiratory viruses) in the coming years.</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 has become endemic, with dynamics that reflect the waning of immunity and re-exposure, by contrast to the epidemic phase driven by exposure in immunologically naive populations. Endemic does not, however, mean constant. Further evolution of SARS-CoV-2, as well as changes in behaviour and public health policy, continue to play a major role in the endemic load of disease and mortality. In this paper, we analyse evolutionary models to explore the impact that newly arising variants can have on the short-term and longer-term endemic load, characterizing how these impacts depend on the transmission and immunological properties of variants. We describe how evolutionary changes in the virus will increase the endemic load most for persistently immune-escape variants, by an intermediate amount for more transmissible variants, and least for transiently immune-escape variants. Balancing the tendency for evolution to favour variants that increase the endemic load, we explore the impact of vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can counter these increases in the impact of disease. We end with some open questions about the future of COVID-19 as an endemic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background In England, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation recommended a spring 2023 booster programme for all adults aged 75 years and older and the immunosuppressed. The vaccines advised were the Sanofi/GSK AS03-adjuvanted monovalent beta variant (VidPrevtyn Beta) booster vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5) bivalent vaccine. This is the first time an adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine has been administered as part of a UK COVID-19 vaccination programme. In clinical trials, the antibody levels generated by the Sanofi/GSK vaccine were comparable to levels generated by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines but to date there are no real-world data on the effectiveness or duration of protection of this vaccine. Methods We used a test-negative case-control study design to estimate the incremental vaccine effectiveness of the Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer bivalent BA.4-5 boosters against hospitalisation amongst those aged 75 years and older in England. The study period for tests contributing to all analyses was from 3rd April 2022 to 27th August 2023. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated relative to those who had received at least two doses prior to their spring booster, with their last dose being an autumn 2022 booster given at least 3 months prior. Findings Overall, there were 14,174 eligible tests from hospitalised individuals aged 75 years and older, with 3,005 being cases and 11,169 being controls. Effectiveness against hospitalisation was highest in the period 9 to 13 days post vaccination for both manufacturers at about 50%; 43.6% (95% C.I.; 20.1 to 60.2%) and 56.4% (95% C.I; 25.8 to 74.4%) for Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5, respectively. There was some evidence of waning with a reduction to about 30% for both manufacturers 5-9 weeks post vaccination. Interpretation Together, these results provide reassuring evidence that both the adjuvanted Sanofi/GSK and Pfizer BA.4-5 booster vaccines provided a good boost to protection against hospitalisation amongst adults aged 75 years and older. The finding that the adjuvanted vaccine targeting the now distant Beta strain had similar effectiveness to the mRNA vaccine targeting more closely matched Omicron sub-lineages BA.4-5 during a period of Omicron circulation may reflect improved protection due to the adjuvant in the Sanofi/GSK product.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAntibiotic usage, contact with high transmission healthcare settings as well as changes in immune system function all vary by a patients age and sex. Yet, most analyses of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) ignore demographic indicators and provide only country level resistance prevalence values.

In this work we use routine surveillance data on serious infections in Europe to characterise the importance of age and sex on incidence and resistance prevalence patterns for 33 different bacteria and antibiotic combinations. We fit Bayesian multilevel regression models to quantify these effects and provide estimates of country-, bacteria- and drug-family effect variation.

ResultsAt the European level, we find distinct patterns in resistance prevalence by age that have previously not been explored in detail. Trends often vary more within an antibiotic family than within a bacterium: clear resistance increases by age for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) contrast with a peak in resistance to several antibiotics at [~]30 years of age for P. aeruginosa. This diverges from the known, clear exponential increase in infection incidence rates by age, which are higher for males except for E. coli at ages 15-40.

At the country-level, the patterns are highly context specific with national and subnational differences accounting for a large amount of resistance variation ([~]38%) and a range of associations between age and resistance prevalence. We explore our results in greater depths for two of the most clinically important bacteria-antibiotic combinations. For MRSA, age trends were mostly positive, with 72% of countries seeing an increased resistance between males aged 1 and 100 and more resistance in males. This compares to age trends for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli which were mostly negative (males: 93% of countries see decreased resistance between ages 1 and 100) with more resistance in females. A change in resistance prevalence between ages 1 and 100 ranged up to [~]0.46 (95% CI 0.37 - 0.51, males) for MRSA but varied between 0.16 (95% CI 0.23-0.3, females) to -0.27 (95%CI -0.4 - - 0.15, males) across individual countries for aminopenicillin resistance in E. coli.

ConclusionPrevalence of resistance in infection varies substantially by the age and sex of the individual revealing gaps in our understanding of AMR epidemiology. These context-specific patterns should now be exploited to improve intervention targeting as well as our understanding of AMR dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The protection of fourth dose mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is relevant to current global policy decisions regarding ongoing booster roll-out. We estimate the effect of fourth dose vaccination, prior infection, and duration of PCR positivity in a highly-vaccinated and largely prior-COVID-19 infected cohort of UK healthcare workers. Methods Participants underwent fortnightly PCR and regular antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and completed symptoms questionnaires. A multi-state model was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection from a fourth dose compared to a waned third dose, with protection from prior infection and duration of PCR positivity jointly estimated. Results 1,298 infections were detected among 9,560 individuals under active follow-up between September 2022 and March 2023. Compared to a waned third dose, fourth dose VE was 13.1% (95%CI 0.9 to 23.8) overall; 24.0% (95%CI 8.5 to 36.8) in the first two months post-vaccination, reducing to 10.3% (95%CI -11.4 to 27.8) and 1.7% (95%CI -17.0 to 17.4) at 2-4 and 4-6 months, respectively. Relative to an infection &gt;2 years ago and controlling for vaccination, 63.6% (95%CI 46.9 to 75.0) and 29.1% (95%CI 3.8 to 43.1) greater protection against infection was estimated for an infection within the past 0-6, and 6-12 months, respectively. A fourth dose was associated with greater protection against asymptomatic infection than symptomatic infection, whilst prior infection independently provided more protection against symptomatic infection, particularly if the infection had occurred within the previous 6 months. Duration of PCR positivity was significantly lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic infection. Conclusions Despite rapid waning of protection, vaccine boosters remain an important tool in responding to the dynamic COVID-19 landscape; boosting population immunity in advance of periods of anticipated pressure, such as surging infection rates or emerging variants of concern.

        <p class="abstract">The slow descent in TB burden, the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the rise of multidrugresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, seriously threaten TB control and the goals of the End TB strategy. To fight back, several vaccine candidates are under development, with some of them undergoing the phases 2B and 3 of the development pipeline. The impact of these vaccines on the general population needs to be addressed using disease-transmission models, and, in a country like China, which last year ranked third in number of cases worldwide, and where the population is undergoing a fast process of demographic aging, the impact of TB vaccination campaigns may depend heavily upon the age of targeted populations and with the mechanistic descriptions of the TB vaccines. For these reasons, transmission models need to capture the coupling between TB dynamics and demographic evolution, as well as to be able to accommodate different mechanistic descriptions of TB vaccine protection. In this work, we studied the potential impact of a new TB vaccine in China targeting adolescents (15-19 y.o.) or elderly people (60-64 y.o.), according to varying vaccine descriptions that represent reasonable mechanisms of action leading to prevention of disease (PoD), or prevention of recurrence (PoR), each of them targetting specific routes to TB disease. To measure the influence of the description of the coupling between transmission dynamics and aging in TB transmission models, we explored two different approaches to comptute the evolution of the contact matrices, which relate to the spreading among different age strata. Our results show that the magnitude of model-based impact estimates substantially depends upon the vaccine profile, and it is also strongly related to the modeling approach chosen to describe the time evolution of contact matrices. In spite of these sources of uncertainty, our results also show, in line with previous modeling works, that elder vaccination is a suitable option in China to reduce the incidence of TB.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Enumeration of state and district-level variation in hypertension prevalence in India and to evaluate the influence of social determinants. METHODS: We used data from the Fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) from 707 districts and 825,954 participants (women 724,115, men 101,839 men) on prevalence of hypertension defined according to standard criteria. Data on multiple social determinants were also obtained from NFHS-5 report. RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.4% (women 21.3%, men 24.0%) with the highest prevalence in women and men, respectively, in Sikkim (34.5 and 41.6%) and Punjab (31.2 and 37.7%) and lowest in Rajasthan (15.4 and 17.9%) and Ladakh (15.7 and 17.4%). Prevalence was more in western and southern Indian districts. High prevalence of hypertension in the young (&lt;30y) was observed in northeastern and northern states. District-level hypertension prevalence correlated negatively with multi-dimensional poverty index (R2 women 0.299, men 0.245) and positively with female literacy (women 0.165, men 0.134). Among women, districts with the highest availability of electricity, clean water, sanitation, clean cooking fuels, healthcare service delivery and better nutrition were associated with more hypertension on univariate and multivariate analyses (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows significant geographical variation in hypertension prevalence in India. Hypertension is more in men with high prevalence of premature hypertension. Better district-level development (less poverty, more literacy) and healthcare services are associated with greater hypertension prevalence in women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceLight at night disrupts human circadian rhythms, which are critical for maintaining optimal health. Circadian disruption accompanies poor health outcomes that precede premature mortality, including cardiometabolic diseases. However, links between personal night light exposure and premature mortality risk have not been established.

ObjectiveTo characterize the association of light at night with all-cause and cardiometabolic mortality risks and to understand the role of circadian disruption in these associations by applying a computational model of the response of the human circadian pacemaker to light.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsUK Biobank cohort, N=88,904, aged 62.4{&#43;/-}7.8 years, 57% female.

ExposureParticipants wore activity tracking watches with light sensors for one week between 2013-2016. Twenty-four-hour light exposure profiles were extracted for each participant, and day-time and night-time hours were defined by factor analysis. A validated mathematical model of the human circadian pacemaker was applied to model circadian amplitude and phase from weekly light data.

Main OutcomeCause-specific mortality (National Health Service) recorded in 2,605 participants across a mean ({&#43;/-}SD) follow-up period of 6.31{&#43;/-}0.83 years after light/activity tracking.

ResultsRisk of all-cause mortality was higher in participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure (HR[95%CI]=1.30[1.15-1.48]), and for those between the 70th-90th percentiles (HR=1.16[1.04-1.28]), compared to the darkest 50%. Participants in the 90th-100th percentiles of night-light exposure also had higher risk of cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.41[1.07-1.85]). Higher circadian amplitude predicted lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.94[0.91-0.97] per SD) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=0.90[0.83-0.96]), and circadian phase that deviated from the group average predicted higher risks of all-cause mortality (HR=1.33[1.17-1.51]) and cardiometabolic mortality (HR=1.48[1.12-1.97]). These findings were robust to adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Conclusions and RelevanceMinimizing exposure to light at night and keeping regular light-dark patterns that enhance circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic health and longevity.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs light exposure at night associated with risk of premature mortality?

FindingsExposure to brighter light at night, recorded with personal light sensors in &gt;88,000 participants, was associated with higher risk of mortality across a subsequent 6-year period. Computational modeling indicated that disrupted circadian rhythms may explain this higher mortality risk.

MeaningAvoiding light at night may be a cost-effective and accessible recommendation for promoting health and longevity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several vaccines have been rolled out and distinct variants with different severity and immune profiles emerged in England. Using data from enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 in vaccine eligible individuals we investigated the antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection according to vaccination status and variant.

MethodsPCR-positive eligible individuals were identified from community PCR testing data in England between February 2021 and April 2022 and contacted by nurses to complete questionnaires at recruitment and 21 days post recruitment. Individuals were sent self-sampling kits and self-sampled nasal/oropharyngeal swabs were taken day 1, day 3 and day 7 post-recruitment as well as acute (day 1), convalescent (follow-up) serum and oral fluid samples. Regression analyses were used to investigate how N antibody seroconversion differs by vaccine status, and to investigate how N and S antibody levels differ by vaccine status overall and stratified by variants. Interval-censored analyses and regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of acute S antibody levels on the duration of positivity, the cycle threshold values, the self-reported symptom severity and the number of symptoms reported.

ResultsA total of 1,497 PCR positive individuals were included. A total of 369 (24.7%) individuals were unvaccinated, 359 (24.0%) participants were infected with Alpha, 762 (50.9%) with Delta and 376 (25.2%) with Omicron. The median age of participants was 49 years old (IQR 39-57). Convalescent anti-N antibody levels were lower in vaccinated individuals and convalescent anti-S antibody levels were higher in vaccinated individuals and increased with the number of doses received. Acute anti-S antibody level increased with the number of doses received. Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were associated with a shorter duration of positivity (overall and for the Delta variant). Higher acute anti-S antibody levels were also associated with higher Ct values (overall and for the Alpha and Delta variants). There was no association between the acute anti-S antibody level and self-reported symptom severity. Individuals with higher acute anti-S antibody level were less likely to report six or more symptoms (overall and for Delta variant).

ConclusionUnderstanding the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time and the immunity it confers is important to inform future vaccination strategies and policies. Our findings suggest that vaccination is associated with high acute anti-S antibody level but reduced convalescent anti-N antibody level. High anti-S antibody level is associated with reduced duration of infection, reduced infectiousness and may also be associated with reduced symptoms severity and number of symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objectives. To investigate the association between childhood adversity and COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality in the UK Biobank. Design. Cohort study. Setting. United Kingdom. Participants. 151,200 participants in the UK Biobank cohort who had completed the Childhood Trauma Screen, were alive at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (01-10-2021), and were still active in the UK Biobank when hospitalization and mortality data were most recently updated (11-2021). Main outcome measures. COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality. Results. Higher self-reports of childhood adversity were related to greater likelihood of COVID-19-related hospitalization in all statistical models. In models adjusted for age, ethnicity, and sex, childhood adversity was associated with an OR of 1.227 of hospitalization (95% CI=1.153 to 1.306, Childhood Adversity z=6.49, p&lt;0.005) and an OR of 1.25 of a COVID-19 related death (95% CI=1.11 to 1.424, Childhood Adversity z=3.5, p&lt;0.005). Adjustment for potential confounds attenuated these associations, although associations remained statistically significant. Conclusions. Childhood adversity was significantly associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and COVID-19-related mortality after adjusting for sociodemographic and health confounders. Further research is needed to clarify the biological and psychosocial processes underlying these associations to inform public health intervention and prevention strategies to minimize COVID-19 disparities.</p>
