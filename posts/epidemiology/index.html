J.\nScore: 1190.1, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298101\nBackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies. ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19. MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015. ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{+/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{+/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.\nAssessing the Impact of Mask Mandates on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission: A Case Study of Utah\nAuthors: Horn, A. C.; Shoemaker, H. E.; Keegan, L. T.\nScore: 139.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298464\nBackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1. MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted. ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm. ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.\nTravel surveillance uncovers dengue virus dynamics and introductions in the Caribbean\nAuthors: Taylor-Salmon, E.; Hill, V.; Paul, L.

H.; Vogels, C. B. F.; Morrison, A. M.; Michael, S. F.; Gru\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.23298412\nDengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and cases are continuing to rise globally. In particular, islands in the Caribbean have experienced more frequent outbreaks, and all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been reported in the region, leading to hyperendemicity and increased rates of severe disease. However, there is significant variability regarding virus surveillance and reporting between islands, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the epidemiological patterns in the Caribbean. To investigate this, we used travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology to reconstruct outbreak dynamics, DENV serotype turnover, and patterns of spread within the region from 2009-2022. We uncovered two recent DENV-3 introductions from Asia, one of which resulted in a large outbreak in Cuba, which was previously under-reported. We also show that while outbreaks can be synchronized between islands, they are often caused by different serotypes. Our study highlights the importance of surveillance of infected travelers to provide a snapshot of local introductions and transmission in areas with limited local surveillance and suggests that the recent DENV-3 introductions may pose a major public health threat in the region.\nThe impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the likelihood of children identified as sources of infection in the NIH workforce: a cohort study\nAuthors: van Loben Sels, J. M.; Bailin, H. B.; Bell, M. R.; McCormick-Ell, J.; McGann, M.; Das, S.; Roder, A. E.; Ghedin, E.; Castel, A. D.; D. Rebecca, P.; Kwan, J. L.\nScore: 122.5, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23297422\nBackgroundChildren (\u003c18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce. ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (\u003c5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months. ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages. What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces. What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.\nAssociation between combined sewer overflow events and gastrointestinal illness in Massachusetts municipalities with and without river-sourced drinking water, 2014-2019\nAuthors: Haley, B. M.; Sun, Y.; Jagai, J. S.; Leibler, J. H.; Fulweiler, R.; Ashmore, J.; Wellenius, G. A.; Heiger-Bernays, W.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297573\nBackgroundCombined sewer overflow (CSO) events release untreated wastewater into surface waterbodies during heavy precipitation or snowmelt. Combined sewer systems serve approximately 40 million people in the United States, primarily in urban and suburban municipalities in the Midwest and Northeast. Predicted increases in heavy precipitation events driven by climate change underscore the importance of quantifying potential health risks associated with CSO events. ObjectivesThe aims of this study were: to 1) estimate the association between CSO events (2014-2019) and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) among Massachusetts municipalities that border a CSO-impacted river, and 2) determine if associations differ by municipal drinking water source. MethodsA case time series design was used to estimate the association between daily cumulative upstream CSO discharge in the prior four days and ED visits for AGI, adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and precipitation. Associations between CSO events and AGI were also compared by municipal drinking water source (CSO-impacted river vs. other sources). ResultsExtreme upstream CSO discharge events (\u003e95th percentile by cumulative volume) were associated with a cumulative risk ratio (CRR) of AGI of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.42) over the next four days for all municipalities, and the association was robust after adjusting for precipitation (1.17 [0.98, 1.39]). In municipalities with CSO-impacted drinking water sources, the adjusted association was somewhat less pronounced following 95th percentile CSO events (1.05 [0.82, 1.33]). The adjusted CRR of AGI was 1.62 in all municipalities following 99th percentile CSO events (95% CI: 1.04, 2.51) and not meaningfully different across strata defined by drinking water source. DiscussionIn municipalities bordering a CSO-impacted river in Massachusetts, extreme CSO events are associated with higher risk of AGI within four days. The largest CSO events are associated with increased risk of AGI regardless of drinking water source.\nDevice-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity and major cardiovascular events\nAuthors: Stamatakis, E.; Ahmadi, M. N.; Biswas, R. K.; del Pozo Cruz, B.; Thogersen-Ntoumani, C.; Murphy, M.; Sabag, A.; Lear, S.; Gill, J. M.; Chow, C. K.; Hamer, M.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297430\nImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults. ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study. ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes. Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke). ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups. Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.\nCombining genomic data and infection estimates to characterize the complex dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in the United States\nAuthors: Lopes, R.; Pham, K.; Klaassen, F.; Chitwood, M. H.; Hahn, A.; Redmond, S.; Swartwood, N. A.; Salomon, J. A.; Menzies, N. A.; Cohen, T.; Grubaugh, N. D.\nScore: 35.3, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.23298178\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US. One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.\nOperationalized releases of wAlbB Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti lead to sharp decreases in dengue incidence dependent on Wolbachia frequency\nAuthors: Hoffmann, A. A.; Wasi Ahmad, N.; Wan, M. K.; Cheong, Y. L.; Ahmad, N. A.; Golding, N.; Tierney, N.; Jelip, J.; Wilson Putit, P.; Mokhtar, N.; Singh Sandhu, S.; Lau, S.

P.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.23298240\nIn Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a replacement strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.\nProtocol for the development of a tool (INSPECT-SR) to identify problematic randomised controlled trials in systematic reviews of health interventions.\nAuthors: Wilkinson, J.

J.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295626\nIntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions. Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.\nA comparison of four self-controlled study designs in an analysis of COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis using five European databases\nAuthors: Schultze, A.; Martin, I.; Messina, D.; Bots, S.; Belitser, S.; Carreras-Martinez, J.

MethodsWe used data from five European databases (Spain: BIFAP, FISABIO VID, and SIDIAP; Italy: ARS-Tuscany; England: CPRD Aurum) converted to the ConcePTION Common Data Model. Individuals who experienced both myocarditis and were vaccinated against COVID-19 between 1 September 2020 and the end of data availability in each country were included. We compared a self-controlled risk interval study (SCRI) using a pre-vaccination control window, an SCRI using a post-vaccination control window, a standard SCCS and an extension of the SCCS designed to handle violations of the assumption of event-dependent exposures. ResultsWe included 1,757 cases of myocarditis. In unadjusted analyses, agreement between study designs varied by vaccine brand. There was good agreement between all designs for AstraZeneca and Pfizer, but for Moderna we found harmful incidence rate ratios (IRR) using the standard and extended SCCS (standard SCCS: IRR = 3.12, 95%CI = 1.53 - 6.40; extended SCCS: IRR = 2.43, 95%CI = 1.11 - 5.33) compared with no association with the SCRIs (SCRI-pre: IRR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.27 - 1.33; SCRI-post: IRR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.34 - 2.19), although confidence intervals were wide. There was very good agreement between all designs for the unadjusted second dose analyses, confirming the known harmful association between the second dose of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and myocarditis. ConclusionsIn the context of the known association between COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis, we have demonstrated that two forms of SCRI and two forms of SCCS led to largely comparable results, possibly because of limited violation of the assumption of event-dependent exposures.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCognitive impairment is the most common and disabling manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. There is an urgent need for the application of more stringent methods for evaluating cognitive outcomes in research studies.

ObjectiveTo determine whether cognitive decline emerges with the onset of COVID-19 and whether it is more pronounced in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 or severe COVID-19.

MethodsThis longitudinal cohort study compared the cognitive performance of 276 patients with COVID-19 to that of 217 controls across four neuroinflammation or vascular disease-sensitive domains of cognition using data collected both before and after the pandemic starting in 2015.

ResultsThe mean age of the COVID-19 group was 56.04{&#43;/-}6.6 years, while that of the control group was 58.1{&#43;/-}7.3 years. Longitudinal models indicated a significant decline in cognitive throughput (({beta}=-0.168, P=.001) following COVID-19, after adjustment for pre-COVID-19 functioning, demographics, and medical factors. The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionCOVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of face masks mandates has been intensely debated. Many methods have been used to demonstrate mask effectiveness, including one that compares the change in reproduction number following implementing and removing face mask mandates1.

MethodsUsing data from Utah, we calculated the effect of mask mandates (EFm) in each local health district from before and after three key mandates: the Salt Lake and Summit County (SLSC) mask mandates enacted; the Utah statewide mask mandate enacted; and the Utah statewide mandate was lifted.

ResultsWe found that most counties had a reduction in the growth rate of cases following the mandates. There were reductions in EFm in many counties after the introduction of the SLSC mask mandates and a more widespread reduction in EFm across the state following the statewide mandate. Lifting the mandates, many counties across the states saw an increase in EFm.

ConclusionOur data show mask mandates were an effective way to reduce transmission both within the jurisdiction they were enacted and in neighboring jurisdictions. We provide evidence to support mask mandates as a way to prevent transmission to be better equipped to respond to future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, and cases are continuing to rise globally. In particular, islands in the Caribbean have experienced more frequent outbreaks, and all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes have been reported in the region, leading to hyperendemicity and increased rates of severe disease. However, there is significant variability regarding virus surveillance and reporting between islands, making it difficult to obtain an accurate understanding of the epidemiological patterns in the Caribbean. To investigate this, we used travel surveillance and genomic epidemiology to reconstruct outbreak dynamics, DENV serotype turnover, and patterns of spread within the region from 2009-2022. We uncovered two recent DENV-3 introductions from Asia, one of which resulted in a large outbreak in Cuba, which was previously under-reported. We also show that while outbreaks can be synchronized between islands, they are often caused by different serotypes. Our study highlights the importance of surveillance of infected travelers to provide a snapshot of local introductions and transmission in areas with limited local surveillance and suggests that the recent DENV-3 introductions may pose a major public health threat in the region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChildren (&lt;18 years old) were not initially considered significant sources of infection (SOIs) for SARS-CoV-2. Risk mitigation strategies were thus prioritized for adults, and vaccination was inaccessible for children until mid-2021. Emergence of novel variants led to significant increases in COVID-19 cases in both children and adults. Whether these emergence events and increased vulnerability of unvaccinated children had a synergistic effect resulting in increased caseloads in adults requires further exploration.

MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among 3,545 workers diagnosed with COVID-19. Case details were compiled during contact investigations. Variants of concern were identified following sequencing of biological samples collected through employer-based testing programs. Logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of having a child SOI based on the dominant variant in the workforce.

ResultsOne-fourth (24.5%) of the cohort reported having a child in-residence; 11.2% identified a child as their SOI. In Alpha-dominant months, the odds of having a child SOI were 0.3, and the child SOI was likely older (5-17 years old). The odds of having a child SOI increased to 1.3 and 2.2 in Delta- and Omicron-dominant months, respectively. The odds of having younger child SOIs (&lt;5 years old) were significantly higher in Omicron-dominant months.

ConclusionsChildren were highly likely to acquire the virus and posed a significant risk of transmission to their adult caretakers during Delta- and Omicron-dominant months. Without proper mitigation strategies in both the home and the workplace, child-associated transmission can threaten operations in the forms of staff shortages.

What is already known on this topicIncreases in transmission trends related to SARs-CoV-2 Variants of Concern have been documented in the literature at the population level and in workplaces.

What this study addsThis study looks more closely at the role that children played in transmission to adult workers, and therefore their potential to seed transmission outside of the home. This interface of transmission has been neglected in the literature but is key for future policy development.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to their caretakers may cause significantly increased odds of infection in a worker population. This may have second order effects for staffing, particularly in workgroups with employees of childbearing age. Employers should consider this in the design of their policies for continuity of operations, telework, and leave.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCombined sewer overflow (CSO) events release untreated wastewater into surface waterbodies during heavy precipitation or snowmelt. Combined sewer systems serve approximately 40 million people in the United States, primarily in urban and suburban municipalities in the Midwest and Northeast. Predicted increases in heavy precipitation events driven by climate change underscore the importance of quantifying potential health risks associated with CSO events.

ObjectivesThe aims of this study were: to 1) estimate the association between CSO events (2014-2019) and emergency department (ED) visits for acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) among Massachusetts municipalities that border a CSO-impacted river, and 2) determine if associations differ by municipal drinking water source.

MethodsA case time series design was used to estimate the association between daily cumulative upstream CSO discharge in the prior four days and ED visits for AGI, adjusting for temporal trends, temperature, and precipitation. Associations between CSO events and AGI were also compared by municipal drinking water source (CSO-impacted river vs. other sources).

ResultsExtreme upstream CSO discharge events (&gt;95th percentile by cumulative volume) were associated with a cumulative risk ratio (CRR) of AGI of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.42) over the next four days for all municipalities, and the association was robust after adjusting for precipitation (1.17 [0.98, 1.39]). In municipalities with CSO-impacted drinking water sources, the adjusted association was somewhat less pronounced following 95th percentile CSO events (1.05 [0.82, 1.33]). The adjusted CRR of AGI was 1.62 in all municipalities following 99th percentile CSO events (95% CI: 1.04, 2.51) and not meaningfully different across strata defined by drinking water source.

DiscussionIn municipalities bordering a CSO-impacted river in Massachusetts, extreme CSO events are associated with higher risk of AGI within four days. The largest CSO events are associated with increased risk of AGI regardless of drinking water source.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceVigorous physical activity is a time-efficient and potent preventive intervention for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), although longer traditional exercise sessions are unappealing or inaccessible to most adults.

ObjectiveWe examined the dose-response associations of device-measured vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA, brief sporadic bouts of higher intensity occurring during daily living) with MACE and its sub-types in women and men. We also undertook analogous analyses in a sample of exercisers.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsProspective cohort analysis of 13,018 women and 9,350 men non-exercisers from the UK Biobank accelerometry sub-study; the contextual analyses involved 34,364 female/24,284 male exercisers from the same sub-study.

ExposuresWrist accelerometer assessed daily VILPA duration of bouts lasting up to 1 and up to 2 minutes.

Outcomes and MeasuresOverall and sex-specific dose-response associations of daily VILPA with MACE and its subtypes (incident myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).

ResultsAmong female/male non-exercisers there were 331/488 all-MACE events (129/250 myocardial infarction, 96/119 heart failure,106/119 stroke events) over a mean 7.9-year follow-up. Daily VILPA duration exhibited a near-linear dose-response association with all MACE, myocardial infarction, and heart failure in women but not in men. Compared to women with no VILPA, the median daily VILPA duration of 3.4 minutes per day was associated with HRs of 0.55 (0.41, 0.75) for all MACE; and 0.33 (0.18, 0.59) for heart failure. Womens minimum doses (the dose associated with 50% of the optimal risk reduction) of 1.2-1.6 minutes of VILPA per day were associated with HRs of 0.70 (0.58, 0.86) for all-MACE, 0.67 (0.50, 0.91) for myocardial infarction and 0.60 (0.45, 0.81) for heart failure, respectively. The equivalent analyses in exercisers in the UK Biobank showed comparable beneficial associations of vigorous intensity activity with all MACE, myocardial infarction and heart failure in both sex groups.

Conclusions and RelevanceAmongst non-exercisers, small amounts of VILPA were associated with substantially lower risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure in women but not in men. No such sex differences were evident among exercisers. VILPA may be a promising physical activity target for CVD prevention in women not willing or able to exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SARS-CoV-2 Omicron surged as a variant of concern (VOC) in late 2021. Subsequently, several distinct Omicron variants have appeared and overtaken each other. We combined variant frequencies from GISAID and infection estimates from a nowcasting model for each US state to estimate variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers (Rt). BA.1 rapidly emerged, and we estimate that it infected 47.7% of the US population between late 2021 and early 2022 before it was replaced by BA.2. We estimate that BA.5, despite a slower takeoff than BA.1, also infected 35.7% of the US population, persisting in circulation for nearly 6 months. Other Omicron variants - BA.2, BA.4, or XBB - infected 30.7% of the US population. We found a positive correlation between the state-level BA.1 attack rate and social vulnerability. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between viral evolution, population susceptibility, and social factors since Omicron emerged in the US.

One-Sentence SummaryFor each US state, we estimate Omicron variant-specific infections, attack rates, and effective reproduction numbers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, introduction of certain strains of inherited Wolbachia symbionts results in transmission blocking of various viruses of public health importance, including dengue. This has resulted in a  replacement strategy for dengue control involving release of male and female mosquitoes, whereupon Wolbachia is able to spread through Ae. aegypti populations to high frequency and reduces the incidence of dengue. Wolbachia strain wAlbB is an effective transmission blocker and stable at high temperatures, making it very suitable for use in hot tropical climates. Following the first trial field releases of the wAlbB strain in Ae. aegypti in Malaysia, releases of wAlbB Ae. aegypti have for the first time become operationalized by the Malaysian health authorities. We report here on changes in dengue incidence based on a set of 20 releases sites and 76 control sites in high rise residential areas, which allows us to directly assess the impact of Wolbachia frequency on dengue incidence. The results indicate an average reduction in dengue of 62.4% (confidence intervals 50-71%); importantly the level of suppression increased with Wolbachia frequency, with suppression of 75.8% (confidence intervals 61-87%) estimated at 100% Wolbachia frequency. These findings emphasize the large impacts of wAlbB Wolbachia invasions on dengue incidence in an operational setting, with the expectation that the level of dengue will further decrease as wider areas are invaded.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INSPECT-SR project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare related interventions.

Methods and analysisThe INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: 1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, 2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, 3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in 4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format, 5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies, and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe aim of this study was to assess the possible extent of bias due to violation of a core assumption (event-dependent exposures) when using self-controlled designs to analyse the association between COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis.

MethodsWe used data from five European databases (Spain: BIFAP, FISABIO VID, and SIDIAP; Italy: ARS-Tuscany; England: CPRD Aurum) converted to the ConcePTION Common Data Model. Individuals who experienced both myocarditis and were vaccinated against COVID-19 between 1 September 2020 and the end of data availability in each country were included. We compared a self-controlled risk interval study (SCRI) using a pre-vaccination control window, an SCRI using a post-vaccination control window, a standard SCCS and an extension of the SCCS designed to handle violations of the assumption of event-dependent exposures.

ResultsWe included 1,757 cases of myocarditis. In unadjusted analyses, agreement between study designs varied by vaccine brand. There was good agreement between all designs for AstraZeneca and Pfizer, but for Moderna we found harmful incidence rate ratios (IRR) using the standard and extended SCCS (standard SCCS: IRR = 3.12, 95%CI = 1.53 - 6.40; extended SCCS: IRR = 2.43, 95%CI = 1.11 - 5.33) compared with no association with the SCRIs (SCRI-pre: IRR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.27 - 1.33; SCRI-post: IRR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.34 - 2.19), although confidence intervals were wide. There was very good agreement between all designs for the unadjusted second dose analyses, confirming the known harmful association between the second dose of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and myocarditis.

ConclusionsIn the context of the known association between COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis, we have demonstrated that two forms of SCRI and two forms of SCCS led to largely comparable results, possibly because of limited violation of the assumption of event-dependent exposures.</p>
