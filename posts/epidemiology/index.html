Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.\nDesign and Analysis Heterogeneity in Observational Studies of COVID-19 Booster Effectiveness: A Review and Case Study\nAuthors: Meah, S.; Shi, X.; Fritsche, L. G.; Salvatore, M.; Wagner, A.; Martin, E. T.; Mukherjee, B.\nScore: 65.7, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.23291692\nBackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear. MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset. ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death). Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome. ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.\nComparison of control and transmission of COVID-19 across epidemic waves in Hong Kong: an observational study\nAuthors: Yang, B.; Lin, Y.; Xiong, W.; Liu, C.; Gao, H.; Ho, F.; Zhou, J.; Zhang, R.; Wong, J.; Cheung, J.; Lau, E.; Tsang, T.; Xiao, J.; Wong, I.; Martin-Sanchez, M.; Leung, G.; Cowling, B. J.; Wu, P.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291593\nBackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter. MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults. FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (\u003e70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [\u0026ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks. InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.\nIncreasing burden of opioid overdose mortality in the United States: Years of life lost by age, race, and state from 2019-2021\nAuthors: Hebert, A. H.; Hill, A. L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292297\nThe United States opioid crisis is worsening, but the nationwide burden has not been characterized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we calculate years of life lost to opioid overdose deaths by demographic group and examine trends from 2019 to 2021. Using the Multiple Cause of Death dataset from CDC WONDER, we extracted opioid overdose deaths stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and state, and estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates, years of life lost, and reduction in life expectancy at birth. Increasing annually, opioid overdose deaths reached 80,411 in 2021, leading to 3 million years of life lost, and reducing life expectancy by 0.65 years. From 2019 to 2021, opioid overdose death rates increased across all groups. American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American men now experience the highest burden, with 1,500 years of life lost per 100,000, life expectancies at birth reduced by almost 1 year, and 46 and 51 deaths per 100,000, respectively. This study highlights the continued growth of the opioid crisis, and the surge in years of life lost coinciding with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions, particularly in light of this epidemics changing demographics.\nSpatio-temporal surveillance and early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern\nAuthors: Cavallaro, M.; Dyson, L.; Tildesley, M. J.; Todkill, D.; Keeling, M. J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292295\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterized by the repeated emergence of genetically distinct virus variants of increased transmissibility and immune evasion compared to pre-existing lineages. In many countries, their containment required the intervention of public health authorities and the imposition of control measures. While the primary role of testing is to identify infection, target treatment, and limit spread (through isolation and contact tracing), a secondary benefit is in terms of surveillance and the early detection of new variants. Here we study the spatial invasion and early spread of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) variants in England from September 2020 to February 2022 using the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) method, a statistical technique for the detection of aberrations in spatial point processes, applied to community PCR (polymerase-chain-reaction) test data where the TaqPath kit provides a proxy measure of the switch between variants. The application of RaNCover method could rapidly detect outbreaks of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and hence inform optimal spatial interventions.\nUnraveling the Decline: Search for Factors Behind the Trend in Parkinsons Disease Incidence Rates: A Cohort Study of German Health Claims Data\nAuthors: Fink, A.; Pavlou, M. A.; Roomp, K.; Doblhammer, G.; Schneider, J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.23291993\nSporadic Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in older age. Recent studies have led to a debate regarding trends in incidence and prevalence. We aimed to investigate age-specific incidence rates of PD and possible explanations for the observed trend in Germany by studying two randomly selected longitudinal cohorts, each consisting of 250,000 individuals aged 50 and above. We started observing them at the beginning of 2004 and 2014, and followed them through the end of 2009 and 2019, respectively. We compared age-specific incidence rates for both cohorts and performed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of PD in the second period compared with the first period ten years earlier, adjusted for age, sex, and several prodromal factors, comorbidities, and risk factors of PD. For each age-group in men and women, we found lower age-specific PD incidence rates in the second period, except for the lowest age-group (50-54) in men. Cox regression analysis demonstrated an overall 20% risk reduction of PD incidence (HR=0.80, 95% confidence interval [0.75-0.86]). Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (+1.98 years) and women (+0,87 years). Stepwise adjustment for prodromal symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors revealed a 22%-49% risk reduction of PD incidence. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed a 48% risk reduction (HR=0.52 [0.48-0.56]), demonstrating the independence of the time trends from changes in death rates. In conclusion, our data show that the risk of PD has decreased over time, and that this decrease is independent of factors such as changes in death rates, age structure, sex, motor and sensory impairments, sleep and psychiatric conditions, comorbidities, and specific risk factors.\n",

We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObservational vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies based on real-world data are a crucial supplement to initial randomized clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. However, there exists substantial heterogeneity in study designs and statistical methods for estimating VE. The impact of such heterogeneity on VE estimates is not clear.

MethodsWe conducted a two-step literature review of booster VE: a literature search for first or second monovalent boosters on January 1, 2023, and a rapid search for bivalent boosters on March 28, 2023. For each study identified, study design, methods, and VE estimates for infection, hospitalization, and/or death were extracted and summarized via forest plots. We then applied methods identified in the literature to a single dataset from Michigan Medicine (MM), providing a comparison of the impact of different statistical methodologies on the same dataset.

ResultsWe identified 53 studies estimating VE of the first booster, 16 for the second booster. Of these studies, 2 were case-control, 17 were test-negative, and 50 were cohort studies. Together, they included nearly 130 million people worldwide. VE for all outcomes was very high (around 90%) in earlier studies (i.e., in 2021), but became attenuated and more heterogeneous over time (around 40%-50% for infection, 60%-90% for hospitalization, and 50%-90% for death). VE compared to the previous dose was lower for the second booster (10-30% for infection, 30-60% against hospitalization, and 50-90% against death). We also identified 11 bivalent booster studies including over 20 million people. Early studies of the bivalent booster showed increased effectiveness compared to the monovalent booster (VE around 50-80% for hospitalization and death).

Our primary analysis with MM data using a cohort design included 186,495 individuals overall (including 153,811 boosted and 32,684 with only a primary series vaccination), and a secondary test-negative design included 65,992 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2. When different statistical designs and methods were applied to MM data, VE estimates for hospitalization and death were robust to analytic choices, with test-negative designs leading to narrower confidence intervals. Adjusting either for the propensity of getting boosted or directly adjusting for covariates reduced the heterogeneity across VE estimates for the infection outcome.

ConclusionWhile the advantage of the second monovalent booster is not obvious from the literature review, the first monovalent booster and the bivalent booster appear to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19. Based on both the literature view and data analysis, VE analyses with a severe disease outcome (hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) appear to be more robust to design and analytic choices than an infection endpoint. Test-negative designs can extend to severe disease outcomes and may offer advantages in statistical efficiency when used properly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHong Kong contained COVID-19 for two years, but experienced a large epidemic of Omicron BA.2 in early 2022 and endemic transmission of Omicron subvariants thereafter.

MethodsWe examined the use and impact of pandemic controls in Hong Kong by analysing data on more than 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and characterizing non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions implemented from January 2020 through to 30 December 2022. We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt) to track changes in transmissibility and effectiveness of community-based measures against infection over time. We examined the temporal changes of pharmaceutical interventions, mortality rate and case-fatality risks (CFRs), particularly among older adults.

FindingsHong Kong experienced four local epidemic waves predominated by the ancestral strain in 2020 and early 2021 and prevented multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from spreading in the community before 2022. Strict travel-related, case-based, and community-based measures were increasingly tightened in Hong Kong over the first two years of the pandemic. However, even very stringent measures were unable to contain the spread of Omicron BA.2 in Hong Kong. Despite high overall vaccination uptake (&gt;70% with at least two doses), high mortality was observed during the Omicron BA.2 wave due to lower vaccine coverage (42%) among adults [&amp;ge;]65 years of age. Increases in antiviral usage and vaccination uptake over time through 2022 was associated with decreased case fatality risks.

InterpretationIntegrated strict measures were able to reduce importation risks and interrupt local transmission to contain COVID-19 transmission and disease burden while awaiting vaccine development and rollout. Increasing coverage of pharmaceutical interventions among high-risk groups reduced infection-related mortality and mitigated the adverse health impact of the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The United States opioid crisis is worsening, but the nationwide burden has not been characterized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study we calculate years of life lost to opioid overdose deaths by demographic group and examine trends from 2019 to 2021.

Using the Multiple Cause of Death dataset from CDC WONDER, we extracted opioid overdose deaths stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and state, and estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates, years of life lost, and reduction in life expectancy at birth.

Increasing annually, opioid overdose deaths reached 80,411 in 2021, leading to 3 million years of life lost, and reducing life expectancy by 0.65 years. From 2019 to 2021, opioid overdose death rates increased across all groups. American Indian/Alaska Native and Black/African American men now experience the highest burden, with 1,500 years of life lost per 100,000, life expectancies at birth reduced by almost 1 year, and 46 and 51 deaths per 100,000, respectively.

This study highlights the continued growth of the opioid crisis, and the surge in years of life lost coinciding with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions, particularly in light of this epidemics changing demographics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been characterized by the repeated emergence of genetically distinct virus variants of increased transmissibility and immune evasion compared to pre-existing lineages. In many countries, their containment required the intervention of public health authorities and the imposition of control measures. While the primary role of testing is to identify infection, target treatment, and limit spread (through isolation and contact tracing), a secondary benefit is in terms of surveillance and the early detection of new variants. Here we study the spatial invasion and early spread of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) variants in England from September 2020 to February 2022 using the random neighbourhood covering (RaNCover) method, a statistical technique for the detection of aberrations in spatial point processes, applied to community PCR (polymerase-chain-reaction) test data where the TaqPath kit provides a proxy measure of the switch between variants. The application of RaNCover method could rapidly detect outbreaks of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and hence inform optimal spatial interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in older age. Recent studies have led to a debate regarding trends in incidence and prevalence. We aimed to investigate age-specific incidence rates of PD and possible explanations for the observed trend in Germany by studying two randomly selected longitudinal cohorts, each consisting of 250,000 individuals aged 50 and above. We started observing them at the beginning of 2004 and 2014, and followed them through the end of 2009 and 2019, respectively. We compared age-specific incidence rates for both cohorts and performed Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) of PD in the second period compared with the first period ten years earlier, adjusted for age, sex, and several prodromal factors, comorbidities, and risk factors of PD. For each age-group in men and women, we found lower age-specific PD incidence rates in the second period, except for the lowest age-group (50-54) in men. Cox regression analysis demonstrated an overall 20% risk reduction of PD incidence (HR=0.80, 95% confidence interval [0.75-0.86]). Mean age at diagnosis increased in men (&#43;1.98 years) and women (&#43;0,87 years). Stepwise adjustment for prodromal symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors revealed a 22%-49% risk reduction of PD incidence. Sensitivity analysis considering the competing event of death showed a 48% risk reduction (HR=0.52 [0.48-0.56]), demonstrating the independence of the time trends from changes in death rates. In conclusion, our data show that the risk of PD has decreased over time, and that this decrease is independent of factors such as changes in death rates, age structure, sex, motor and sensory impairments, sleep and psychiatric conditions, comorbidities, and specific risk factors.</p>
