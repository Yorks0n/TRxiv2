Methods Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020. Results Corrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices. Conclusions While more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with long COVID to minimize driving.\nHormonal Contraceptives are Shaping the Human Plasma Proteome in a Large Population Cohort\nAuthors: Dordevic, N.; Dierks, C.; Hantikainen, E.; Farztdinov, V.; Amari, F.; Verri Hernandes, V.; De Grandi, A.; Domingues, F. S.; MuÌˆlleder, M.; Pramstaller, P. P.; Rainer, J.; Ralser, M.\nScore: 27.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296871\nLarge-scale plasma proteomics in population studies offer new avenues to explore non-genetic associations, such as biomarkers for lifestyle and environmental exposure. Moreover, through longitudinal monitoring, they help in characterizing the onset and progression of diseases. Utilizing the SWATH DIA-MS-based proteomic approach with 5-minute chromatographic gradients, we examined the neat plasma proteome of 3,632 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. We present precise protein quantities for 148 highly abundant plasma protein groups. Many of these proteins are challenging to quantify using affinity-based reagents. This set of highly abundant plasma proteins includes immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, metabolic proteins, and components of the innate immune system, such as the complement system. Our findings indicate that, beyond age and sex, the most significant biological variable affecting the plasma proteome was the use of hormonal contraceptives. The signature from this drug class was more pronounced compared to other common medications, which influenced only a subset of the measured proteins and exhibited smaller effect sizes. Notably, Angiotensinogen (AGT) levels were strongly influenced by contraceptive use, suggesting that AGT levels might serve as a potential biomarker for contraceptive usage. Due to its high prevalence, and apparently strong influence, this type of medication should be accounted for in any epidemiological or clinical study of the plasma proteome to avoid spurious findings.\nEvaluation of Stroke Risk Following COVID-19 mRNA Bivalent Vaccines Among U.S. Adults Aged \u003e=65 Years\nAuthors: Lu, Y.; Matuska, K.; Nadimpalli, G.; Ma, Y.; Duma, N.; Zhang, H.; Chiang, Y.; Lyu, H.; Chillarige, Y.; Forshee, R. A.; Anderson, S. A.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.23296624\nIn January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults 65 years of age or older receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years of age or older receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA 1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the 85+ year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.69 [1 to 21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.52 [1 to 21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42 [22 to 42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.74 [1 to 21 days]) with mRNA 1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17 [22 to 42 days]).\nModelling the impact of population mobility, post-infection immunity and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Dominican Republic\nAuthors: Finch, E.; Nilles, E. J.; Then Paulino, C.; Skewes-Ramm, R.; Lau, C.; Lowe, R.; Kucharski, A. J.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296586\nCOVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations. We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios. We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.\nCovid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, a nested case-control study in births from April 2021 to March 2022, England\nAuthors: Mensah, A. A.; Stowe, J.; Jardine, J. E.; Kirsebom, F. C.; Clare, T.; Kall, M.; Campbell, H.; Lopez-Bernal, J.; Andrews, N.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296737\nIntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy. MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception. Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95). ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes. What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants. What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer. How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.\nSocio-demographic and genetic risk factors for drug adherence and persistence: a retrospective nation-wide and biobank study across 5 medication classes and 1 814 521 individuals\nAuthors: Cordioli, M.; Corbetta, A.; Kariis, H. M.; Jukarainen, S.; Vartiainen, P.; Kiiskinen, T.; Ferro, M.; FinnGen, ; Estonian Biobank research team, ; Lehto, K.; Niemi, M.; Ripatti, S.; Milani, L.; Ganna, A.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296740\nLow drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data). Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.\nMathematical modeling of SARS-CoV-2 variant substitutions in European countries: Transmission dynamics and epidemiological insights\nAuthors: Lopez de Rioja, V.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296888\nBackgroundCountries across Europe have faced similar evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Materials and MethodsWe used data from GISAID and applied a robust, automated mathematical substitution model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 variants across Europe over a period of more than two years, from late 2020 to early 2023. This model identifies variant substitution patterns and distinguishes between residual and dominant behavior. We used weekly sequencing data from 19 European countries to estimate the increase in transmissibility ({triangleup}{beta}) between consecutive SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, we focused on large countries with separate regional outbreaks and complex scenarios of multiple competing variants. ResultsOur model accurately reproduced the observed substitution patterns between the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron major variants. We estimated the daily variant prevalence and calculated {triangleup}{beta} between variants, revealing that: (i) {triangleup}{beta} increased progressively from the Alpha to the Omicron variant; (ii) {triangleup}{beta} showed a high degree of variability within Omicron variants; (iii) a higher {triangleup}{beta} was associated with a later emergence of the variant within a country; (iv) a higher degree of immunization of the population against previous variants was associated with a higher {triangleup}{beta} for the Delta variant; (v) larger countries exhibited smaller {triangleup}{beta}, suggesting regionally diverse outbreaks within the same country; and finally (vi) the model reliably captures the dynamics of competing variants, even in complex scenarios. ConclusionsThe use of mathematical models allows for the precise and reliable estimation of daily cases of each variant. By quantifying {triangleup}{beta}, we have tracked the spread of the different variants across Europe, highlighting a robust increase in transmissibility trend from Alpha to Omicron. On the other hand, we have shown that the country-level increases in transmissibility can always be influenced by the geographical characteristics of the country and the timing of the emergence of the variant.\nUnited States Marijuana Legalization and Opioid Mortality Trends Before and During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: Bleyer, A.; Barnes, B.; Finn, K.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.23296502\nTo determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.\nTrends in Nationally Notifiable Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Korea\nAuthors: Chang, T.; Cho, S.-i.; Yoo, D.-s.; Min, K.-D.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297064\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented to cope with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. These interventions could also have affected other infectious diseases, but there have been no comprehensive studies regarding their impacts. This study examined trends in notifiable infectious diseases in both humans and animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed for each disease using data from 2016 to 2019, and the incidences for 2020 to 2021 were predicted. Subsequently, the predicted numbers of cases were compared with actual observations. Our findings indicated a substantial reduction in human respiratory infectious diseases during implementation of NPIs. However, human gastrointestinal infectious diseases and livestock diseases did not show a significant decrease. The results revealed that the preventive effect sizes of NPIs varied among diseases and indicated the potential for side effects, suggesting that complementary interventions are needed to minimize these negative effects.\nUnravelling Causal Associations between Population Mobility and COVID-19 Cases in Spain: a Transfer Entropy Analysis\nAuthors: Ponce de Leon, M.; Pontes, C.; Arenas, A.; Valencia, A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296732\nHuman mobility is a well-known factor in the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to healthcare systems collapsing in numerous countries, such as Spain and Italy, resulting in a significant number of deaths. To avoid such disastrous outcomes in the future, it is vital to understand how population mobility is linked to the spread of infectious diseases. To assess that, we applied an information theoretic approach called transfer entropy (TE) to measure the influence of the number of infected people travelling between two localities on the future number of infected people in the destination. We first validated our approach using simulated data from a SIR epidemiological model and found that the mobility-based TE was effective in filtering out non-causal influences that could otherwise arise, thereby successfully recovering the epidemics spreading patterns and the mobility network topology. We then applied the mobility-based TE to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. We identified which regions acted as the main drivers of the pandemic at different periods, both globally and locally. Our results unravelled significant epidemiological events such as the outbreak in Lleida during the Summer of 2020, caused by the influx of temporary workers. We also analysed the effects of a non-pharmaceutical intervention in Catalunya, using mobility- based TE to compare the infection dynamics with a control region. These results help clarify how human mobility influences the dynamic spread of infectious diseases and could be used to inform future non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objective To examine data on COVID-19 disease associated with a 10 percent increase in U.S. road deaths from 2020 to 2021 that raises the question of the potential effect of pandemic stress and neurological damage from COVID-19 disease. Methods Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of recent COVID-19 cases, accumulated cases, maximum temperatures, truck registrations, and gasoline prices with road deaths monthly among U.S. states in 2021. Using the regression coefficients, changes in each risk factor from 2020 to 2021 were used to calculate expected deaths in 2021 if each factor had remained the same as in 2020. Results Corrected for the other risk factors, road deaths were associated with accumulated COVID-19 cases but not cases in the previous month More than 20,700 road deaths were associated with the changes in accumulated COVID-19 cases but were substantially offset by about 19,100 less-than-expected deaths associated with increased gasoline prices. Conclusions While more research is needed, the data are sufficient to warn people with long COVID to minimize driving.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large-scale plasma proteomics in population studies offer new avenues to explore non-genetic associations, such as biomarkers for lifestyle and environmental exposure. Moreover, through longitudinal monitoring, they help in characterizing the onset and progression of diseases. Utilizing the SWATH DIA-MS-based proteomic approach with 5-minute chromatographic gradients, we examined the neat plasma proteome of 3,632 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. We present precise protein quantities for 148 highly abundant plasma protein groups. Many of these proteins are challenging to quantify using affinity-based reagents. This set of highly abundant plasma proteins includes immunoglobulins, coagulation factors, metabolic proteins, and components of the innate immune system, such as the complement system. Our findings indicate that, beyond age and sex, the most significant biological variable affecting the plasma proteome was the use of hormonal contraceptives. The signature from this drug class was more pronounced compared to other common medications, which influenced only a subset of the measured proteins and exhibited smaller effect sizes. Notably, Angiotensinogen (AGT) levels were strongly influenced by contraceptive use, suggesting that AGT levels might serve as a potential biomarker for contraceptive usage. Due to its high prevalence, and apparently strong influence, this type of medication should be accounted for in any epidemiological or clinical study of the plasma proteome to avoid spurious findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In January 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted a safety concern for ischemic stroke in adults 65 years of age or older receiving the BNT162b2; WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. This self-controlled case series analysis evaluated stroke risk among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years of age or older receiving: 1) a Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2; WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5) or Moderna (mRNA 1273.222) COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, 2) high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and 3) concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccines and influenza vaccines, from August 31 to November 6, 2022. The primary analysis did not find elevated stroke risk following COVID-19 bivalent vaccines. In the age subgroup analyses, only the 85&#43; year age group had a risk of NHS (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.36, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.69 [1 to 21 days]) and NHS/TIA (IRR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.52 [1 to 21 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5. Among beneficiaries receiving a concomitant COVID-19 bivalent vaccine and a high-dose/adjuvanted influenza vaccine, an increased risk was observed for NHS (IRR=1.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.42 [22 to 42 days]) with BNT162b2 Bivalent WT OMI BA.4 and BA.5 and for TIA (IRR=1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.74 [1 to 21 days]) with mRNA 1273.222. Results of the secondary analyses showed a small increased risk of NHS following high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines (IRR=1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17 [22 to 42 days]).</p>

        <p class="abstract">COVID-19 epidemic dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of factors including population behaviour, government interventions, new variants, vaccination campaigns and immunity from prior infections. We aimed to quantify the epidemic drivers of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the Dominican Republic, an upper-middle income country of 10.8 million people, and assess the impact of the vaccination campaign implemented in February 2021 in saving lives and averting hospitalisations.

We used an age-structured, multi-variant transmission dynamic model to characterise epidemic drivers in the Dominican Republic and explore counterfactual scenarios around vaccination coverage and population mobility. We fit the model to reported deaths, hospital bed occupancy, ICU bed occupancy and seroprevalence data until December 2021 and simulated epidemic trajectories under different counterfactual vaccination scenarios.

We estimate that vaccination averted 5040 hospital admissions (95% CrI: 4750 - 5350), 1500 ICU admissions (95% CrI: 1420 - 1590) and 544 deaths (95% CrI: 488 - 606) in the first 6 months of the campaign. We also found that early vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac was preferable to delayed vaccination using a product with higher efficacy. We investigated the trade-off between changes in vaccination coverage and population mobility to understand how much relaxation of social distancing measures vaccination was able to  buy in the later stages of a pandemic. We found that if no vaccination had occurred, an additional decrease of 10-20% in population mobility would have been required to maintain the same death and hospitalisation outcomes. We found SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in the Dominican Republic were driven by substantial accumulation of immunity during the first two years of the pandemic but that, despite this, vaccination was essential in enabling a return to pre-pandemic mobility levels without incurring considerable additional morbidity and mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionVaccine safety in pregnancy is always of paramount importance. Current evidence of COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy has been reassuring with no association found with negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, very few safety studies are conducted on a national level and investigate dosage, timing of vaccination as well as vaccine manufacturer. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a population based COVID-19 vaccine safety evaluation in England, including timing of vaccination by trimester, dosage and vaccine manufacturer received in pregnancy.

MethodA matched case control study nested in a retrospective cohort where adverse maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes were compared across several COVID-19 vaccine exposures using conditional multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for a range of demographic and health characteristics. Eligible participants were identified from the national maternity services dataset (MSDS) and records were linked to hospital admission, national COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 testing databases. Matching criteria differed by outcome but included participants age and estimated week of conception.

Results514,013 pregnant individuals aged between 18 and 50 years were identified during the study period (births from 16th of April 2021-31st March 2022). Receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy conferred lower odds of giving birth to a baby who was low birthweight (aOR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), preterm (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.85 - 0.92) or who had an Apgar score less than 7 at five mins of age (aOR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80 - 0.98). There was no association between vaccination in pregnancy and stillbirth (aOR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.76 - 1.07), neonatal death (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 0.91 - 1.77) perinatal death (aOR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.83 - 1.16), and maternal venous thromboembolism in pregnancy (aOR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.43 - 1.56). The odds of maternal admission to intensive care unit were lower in vaccinated pregnant women (aOR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76 - 0.95).

ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy and they confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Our findings generated important information to communicate to pregnant women and health professionals to support COVID-19 maternal vaccination programmes.

What is already known on this topicCurrent evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy. However, few studies investigate the timing of vaccination in pregnancy including the first trimester for late pregnancy outcomes. Most studies are geographically limited, and few are population based allowing inclusion of participants representative of the countrys inhabitants.

What this study addsThis is the first population-based study in England investigating COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy. We used the national maternity services dataset and national English health services data enabling inclusion of a huge numbers of participants across the country. As such, we were able to investigate relevant safety research questions such as the timing of vaccine administration in pregnancy by trimester and before pregnancy, the number of doses received and vaccine manufacturer.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis national study adds to further existing evidence demonstrating that all COVID-19 vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy at any point in time and gives pregnant individuals confidence in the COVID-19 maternal vaccine programme. We demonstrated that receiving multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and additionally it was reassuring that there was no evidence of an increased risk by vaccine type.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Low drug adherence is a major obstacle to the benefits of pharmacotherapies, and it is therefore important to identify factors associated with discontinuing or being poorly adherent to a prescribed treatment regimen. Using high-quality nationwide health registry data and genome-wide genotyping, we evaluate the impact of socio-demographic and genetic risk factors on adherence and persistence for 5 common medication classes that require long-term, regular therapy (N = 1 814 591 individuals, 185 931 with genetic data).

Need for social assistance and immigration status showed a notable negative effect on persistence and adherence across the examined medications (odd ratios between 0.48 and 0.82 for persistence and between 1.1% to 4.3% decrease in adherence) while demographic (age and sex), health (comorbidity status), and genetic factors showed comparably modest or inconsistent effects. Some pharmacogenes were modestly associated with persistence, but not with adherence. We observed significant genetic correlations between medication adherence and participation in research studies. Overall, our findings suggest that socio-economically disadvantaged groups would benefit from targeted interventions to improve the dispensing and uptake of pharmacological treatments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCountries across Europe have faced similar evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants.

Materials and MethodsWe used data from GISAID and applied a robust, automated mathematical substitution model to study the dynamics of COVID-19 variants across Europe over a period of more than two years, from late 2020 to early 2023. This model identifies variant substitution patterns and distinguishes between residual and dominant behavior. We used weekly sequencing data from 19 European countries to estimate the increase in transmissibility ({triangleup}{beta}) between consecutive SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, we focused on large countries with separate regional outbreaks and complex scenarios of multiple competing variants.

ResultsOur model accurately reproduced the observed substitution patterns between the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron major variants. We estimated the daily variant prevalence and calculated {triangleup}{beta} between variants, revealing that: (i) {triangleup}{beta} increased progressively from the Alpha to the Omicron variant; (ii) {triangleup}{beta} showed a high degree of variability within Omicron variants; (iii) a higher {triangleup}{beta} was associated with a later emergence of the variant within a country; (iv) a higher degree of immunization of the population against previous variants was associated with a higher {triangleup}{beta} for the Delta variant; (v) larger countries exhibited smaller {triangleup}{beta}, suggesting regionally diverse outbreaks within the same country; and finally (vi) the model reliably captures the dynamics of competing variants, even in complex scenarios.

ConclusionsThe use of mathematical models allows for the precise and reliable estimation of daily cases of each variant. By quantifying {triangleup}{beta}, we have tracked the spread of the different variants across Europe, highlighting a robust increase in transmissibility trend from Alpha to Omicron. On the other hand, we have shown that the country-level increases in transmissibility can always be influenced by the geographical characteristics of the country and the timing of the emergence of the variant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To determine if marijuana legalization reduced opioid mortality, the U.S. opioid and fentanyl subset death trends during the 2010-2019 decade were compared in states and District of Columbia (D.C.) (jurisdictions) that had implemented marijuana legalization with states that had not. Acceleration of opioid mortality during 2020, first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, was also compared in recreational and medicinal-only legalizing jurisdictions. Joinpoint methodology was applied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER data. Trends in legalizing jurisdictions were cumulative aggregates. The overall opioid and fentanyl death rates and percentage of opioid deaths due to fentanyl increased more during 2010-2019 in jurisdictions that legalized marijuana than in those that did not (pairwise comparison p = 0.007, 0.05, and 0.006, respectively). By 2019, the opioid and fentanyl death rates were 44% and 50% greater in the legalizing than non-legalizing jurisdictions, respectively. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, jurisdictions that implemented recreational marijuana legalization before 2019 had significantly greater increases in both overall opioid and fentanyl death rates than jurisdictions with medicinal-only legalization. For all opioids, the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) 2019-to-2020 increases were 46.5% (95% CI, 36.6% to 56.3%) and 29.1% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.9%), respectively (p = 0.02). For fentanyl, they were 115.6% (95% CI, 80.2% to 151.6%) and 55.4% (95% CI, 31.6% to 79.2%), respectively (p = 0.01). Marijuana legalization is correlated with worsening of the U.S. opioid epidemic, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic with recreational legalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented to cope with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in South Korea. These interventions could also have affected other infectious diseases, but there have been no comprehensive studies regarding their impacts. This study examined trends in notifiable infectious diseases in both humans and animals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed for each disease using data from 2016 to 2019, and the incidences for 2020 to 2021 were predicted. Subsequently, the predicted numbers of cases were compared with actual observations. Our findings indicated a substantial reduction in human respiratory infectious diseases during implementation of NPIs. However, human gastrointestinal infectious diseases and livestock diseases did not show a significant decrease. The results revealed that the preventive effect sizes of NPIs varied among diseases and indicated the potential for side effects, suggesting that complementary interventions are needed to minimize these negative effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human mobility is a well-known factor in the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus led to healthcare systems collapsing in numerous countries, such as Spain and Italy, resulting in a significant number of deaths. To avoid such disastrous outcomes in the future, it is vital to understand how population mobility is linked to the spread of infectious diseases. To assess that, we applied an information theoretic approach called transfer entropy (TE) to measure the influence of the number of infected people travelling between two localities on the future number of infected people in the destination. We first validated our approach using simulated data from a SIR epidemiological model and found that the mobility-based TE was effective in filtering out non-causal influences that could otherwise arise, thereby successfully recovering the epidemics spreading patterns and the mobility network topology. We then applied the mobility-based TE to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. We identified which regions acted as the main drivers of the pandemic at different periods, both globally and locally. Our results unravelled significant epidemiological events such as the outbreak in Lleida during the Summer of 2020, caused by the influx of temporary workers. We also analysed the effects of a non-pharmaceutical intervention in Catalunya, using mobility- based TE to compare the infection dynamics with a control region. These results help clarify how human mobility influences the dynamic spread of infectious diseases and could be used to inform future non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>
