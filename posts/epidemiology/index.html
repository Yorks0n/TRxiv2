M.; Alcantara, L. C. J.; Marcello, A.; Ciccozzi, M.; Lourenco, J.; Giovanetti, M.\nScore: 26.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300208\nDengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.\nLong-Term Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Variants and Other Respiratory Infections: Evidence from the Virus Watch Prospective Cohort in England\nAuthors: Beale, S.; Yavlinsky, A.; Fong, W. L. E.; Nguyen, V.; Kovar, J.; Vos, T.; Wulf Hansen, S.; Hayward, A.; Abubakar, I.; Aldridge, R. W.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300124\nBackgroundGiven the considerable prevalence of long-term sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding pathogen-related factors that influence long-term outcomes is warranted. We aimed to compare the likelihood of long-term symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 variants, other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and non-infected individuals. MethodData were from 5,630 individuals participating in Virus Watch, a prospective community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in England. We used logistic regression to compare the predicted probability of developing long-term symptoms (\u003e2 months duration) during different variant dominance periods according to infection status (SARS-CoV-2, other ARI, or no infection), adjusting for confounding by demographic and clinical factors and vaccination status. ResultsPredicted probability of long-term sequelae was greater following SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Wild Type (adjusted predicted probability (PP) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.14-0.43), Alpha (PP= 0.28, 95% CI =0.14-0.42), Delta (PP= 0.34, 95% CI=0.25-0.43) and Omicron BA.1 periods (PP= 0.27, 95% CI =0.22-0.33) compared to later Omicron sub-variants (PP range from 0.11, 95% CI 0.08-0.15 to 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.18). While differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs (PP range 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.11 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.28) varied by period, estimates for long-term symptoms following both infection types substantially exceeded those for non-infected participants (PP range 0.01, 95% CI 0.00,0.02 to 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) across all variant periods. ConclusionsBetween-variant differences influenced the likelihood of post-infection sequelae for SARS-CoV-2, with lower predicted probabilities for recent Omicron sub-variants similar to those for other contemporaneous ARIs. Both SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs were associated with long-term symptom development, and further aetiological investigation including between-pathogen comparison is recommended.\nAssociations of infections and vaccines with Alzheimer's disease point to a major role of compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen in AD\nAuthors: Ukraintseva, S. V.; Yashkin, A. P.; Akushevich, I.; Arbeev, K. G.; Duan, H.; Gorbunova, G. A.; Stallard, P. J. E.; Yashin, A. I.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299092\nINTRODUCTIONDiverse pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) have been linked to Alzheimers disease (AD) indicating a possibility that the culprit may be compromised immunity rather than particular microbe. If true, then vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity might be protective against AD. METHODSWe estimated associations of common adult infections, including herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses, as well as vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risk of AD in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study. RESULTSShingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%. DISCUSSIONOur results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.\nProtect or prevent? A practicable framework for the dilemmas of COVID-19 vaccine prioritization\nAuthors: Arghal, R.; Rubin, H.; Saeedi Bidokhti, S.; Sarkar, S.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.10.23299100\nDetermining COVID-19 vaccination strategies presents many challenges in light of limited vaccination capacity and the heterogeneity of affected communities. Who should be prioritized for early vaccination when different groups manifest different levels of risks and contact rates? Answering such questions often becomes computationally intractable given that network size can exceed millions. We obtain a framework to compute the optimal vaccination strategy within seconds to minutes from among all strategies, including highly dynamic ones that adjust vaccine allocation as often as required, and even with modest computation resources. We then determine the optimal strategy for a large range of parameter values representative of various US states, countries, and case studies including retirement homes and prisons. The optimal is almost always one of a few candidate strategies, and, even when not, the suboptimality of the best among these candidates is minimal. Further, we find that many commonly deployed vaccination strategies, such as vaccinating the high risk group first, or administering second doses without delay, can often incur higher death rates, hospitalizations, and symptomatic counts. Our framework can be easily adapted to future variants or pandemics through appropriate choice of the compartments of the disease and parameters.\nAdverse Events Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Adolescents: A Norwegian Nationwide Register-Based Study\nAuthors: Bergstad Larsen, V.; Gunnes, N.; Gran, J. M.; Boas, H.; Dahl, J.; Viksmoen Watle, S.; Berild, J. D.; Greve-Isdahl, M.; Stoerdal, K.; Gulseth, H.; Karlstad, O.; Lopez-Doriga Ruiz, P.; Tapia, G.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299926\nBackground: Vaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and Methods: The study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. Results: Most outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. Conclusions: In general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.\nAdverse Events Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Adolescents: A Norwegian Nationwide Register-Based Study\nAuthors: Bergstad Larsen, V.; Gunnes, N.; Gran, J.

L. E.; Powell, T. R.; Young, A. H.; Dawe, G. S.; Lewis, C. M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300105\nBackgroundLithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality. MethodsThe UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality. Results591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality. ConclusionsWe observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.\nGenetic evidence for efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6, and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes: A Mendelian randomization study\nAuthors: Heikkila, T. E.; Kaiser, E. K.; Lin, J.; Gill, D.; Koskenniemi, J. J.; Karhunen, V.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300016\nBackgroundType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes. MethodsWe obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes. FindingsColocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]). InterpretationOur findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for GWAS, Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and other studies for genetic evidence of efficacy of targeting IL2RA, IL2RB, IL6R, IL6ST, IL23A, TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. We searched studies with combinations of \"IL2RA\", \"IL2RB\", \"IL6R\", \"IL6ST\", \"IL23A\", \"JAK2\", \"JAK3\", \"TYK2\", \"colocalization\", \"mendelian randomization\", or \"GWAS\" and \"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1\"[Mesh]. A recent large GWAS by Robertson et al. observed five conditionally independent genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in intergenic and intronic areas near IL2RA. Another large recent GWAS by Chiou et al. found six independent SNPs associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes near IL2RA. A few smaller candidate gene studies also reported associations between the risk of type 1 diabetes and eight other loci near IL2RA. Epigenetic studies reported that a few type 1 diabetes risk variants near IL2RA are associated with changes in methylation of DNA near promoters of IL2RA in white blood cells and B-cells. Both above mentioned GWAS found associations between two missense mutations in TYK2 gene (rs12720356(A\u003eC), rs34536443(G\u003eC)) and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The same variants protected against type 1 diabetes and some other autoimmune diseases in a Finnish FINNGEN biobank study. Smaller candidate gene studies found that the rs2304256 A/A genotype was protective against type 1 diabetes in a Southern Brazilian and in a European population. In a study of Japanese population, similar association was not seen, possibly due to differences in allele frequencies and incidence of type 1 diabetes between populations. In the same study, TYK2 promoter haplotype with genetic polymorphisms in promoter region and exon 1 decreased the promoter activity and increased the risk for type 1 diabetes. The minor 358Ala allele of the IL6R SNP rs2228145 (A\u003eC) was found to be associated with a reduced risk of developing T1D. In addition to loci near or at IL2RA and TYK2 loci, the GWAS by Robertson et al. reported an association between rs2229238 near IL6R and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, a candidate gene study found that the GG haplotypes of variants rs11171806 and rs2066808 (in strong LD) near IL23A was protective against T1D. We found no studies in which colocalization between the loci near the reviewed genes and type 1 diabetes was reported nor estimates from Mendelian randomization on the possible causal relationship. However, Robertson et al. studied the genetic evidence for therapeutic potential of their GWAS hits using a priority index algorithm, which combined information from GWAS of type 1 diabetes, expression quantitative loci in immune cells, evidence from chromatin conformation in immune cells, as well as protein-protein interactions and genomic annotations. Among the reported GWAS hits, priority index ranked IL2RA as the top target, followed by TYK2 (the 3rd target), JAK2 (11th), IL23 (25th), JAK3 (35th), and IL6R (50th). Added value of this studyWe found that the risk of type 1 diabetes and whole-blood gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R colocalized to rs61839660 near IL2RA and rs10908839 near IL6R, respectively. Using these loci as instruments of IL2RA and IL6R expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that whole blood IL2RA expression is associated with decreased risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.70 per 1 SD increase) whereas IL6R expression is associated with increased risk (OR 1.079 per 1 SD increase). Furthermore, when a missense variant rs2304256 in TYK2 was used as an instrument for TYK2 expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that an SD increase in TYK2 expression was predicted to decrease the risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.61). Implications of all the available evidenceWe found genetic evidence supporting the efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6 and TYK2 signalling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to address when would be the most optimal time to intervene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.\nCombined multiplex panel test results are a poor estimate of disease prevalence without adjustment for test error.\nAuthors: Challen, R.; Chatzilena, A.; Qian, G.; Kwiatkowska, R.; Hyams, C.; Finn, A.; Tsaneva-Atanasova, K.; Danon, L.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299860\nMultiplex panel tests identify many individual pathogens at once, using a set of component tests. In some panels the number of components can be large. If the panel is detecting causative pathogens for a single syndrome or disease then we might estimate the burden of that disease by combining the results of the panel, for example determining the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia as caused by many individual pneumococcal serotypes. When we are dealing with multiplex test panels with many components, test error in the individual components of a panel, even when present at very low levels, can cause significant overall error. Uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests, and statistical fluctuations in the numbers of false positives and false negatives, will cause large uncertainty in the combined estimates of disease prevalence. In many cases this can be a source of significant bias. In this paper we develop a mathematical framework to characterise this issue, present novel statistical methods that adjust for this bias and quantify uncertainty, and use simulation to test these methods. As multiplex testing becomes more commonly used for screening in routine clinical practice, accumulation of test error due to the combination of large numbers of test results needs to be identified and corrected for. Author summaryDuring analysis of pneumococcal incidence data obtained from serotype specific multiplex urine antigen testing, we identified that despite excellent test sensitivity and specificity, the small error rate in each individual serotype test has the potential to compound and cause large uncertainty in the resulting estimates of pneumococcal prevalence, obtained by combining individual results. This limits the accuracy of estimates of the burden of disease caused by vaccine preventable pneumococcal serotypes, and in certain situations can produce marked bias.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGiven the considerable prevalence of long-term sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection, understanding pathogen-related factors that influence long-term outcomes is warranted. We aimed to compare the likelihood of long-term symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 variants, other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and non-infected individuals.

MethodData were from 5,630 individuals participating in Virus Watch, a prospective community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in England. We used logistic regression to compare the predicted probability of developing long-term symptoms (&gt;2 months duration) during different variant dominance periods according to infection status (SARS-CoV-2, other ARI, or no infection), adjusting for confounding by demographic and clinical factors and vaccination status.

ResultsPredicted probability of long-term sequelae was greater following SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Wild Type (adjusted predicted probability (PP) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.14-0.43), Alpha (PP= 0.28, 95% CI =0.14-0.42), Delta (PP= 0.34, 95% CI=0.25-0.43) and Omicron BA.1 periods (PP= 0.27, 95% CI =0.22-0.33) compared to later Omicron sub-variants (PP range from 0.11, 95% CI 0.08-0.15 to 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.18). While differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs (PP range 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.11 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.18-0.28) varied by period, estimates for long-term symptoms following both infection types substantially exceeded those for non-infected participants (PP range 0.01, 95% CI 0.00,0.02 to 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) across all variant periods.

ConclusionsBetween-variant differences influenced the likelihood of post-infection sequelae for SARS-CoV-2, with lower predicted probabilities for recent Omicron sub-variants similar to those for other contemporaneous ARIs. Both SARS-CoV-2 and other ARIs were associated with long-term symptom development, and further aetiological investigation including between-pathogen comparison is recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONDiverse pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) have been linked to Alzheimers disease (AD) indicating a possibility that the culprit may be compromised immunity rather than particular microbe. If true, then vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity might be protective against AD.

METHODSWe estimated associations of common adult infections, including herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses, as well as vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risk of AD in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study.

RESULTSShingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%.

DISCUSSIONOur results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Determining COVID-19 vaccination strategies presents many challenges in light of limited vaccination capacity and the heterogeneity of affected communities. Who should be prioritized for early vaccination when different groups manifest different levels of risks and contact rates? Answering such questions often becomes computationally intractable given that network size can exceed millions. We obtain a framework to compute the optimal vaccination strategy within seconds to minutes from among all strategies, including highly dynamic ones that adjust vaccine allocation as often as required, and even with modest computation resources. We then determine the optimal strategy for a large range of parameter values representative of various US states, countries, and case studies including retirement homes and prisons. The optimal is almost always one of a few candidate strategies, and, even when not, the suboptimality of the best among these candidates is minimal. Further, we find that many commonly deployed vaccination strategies, such as vaccinating the high risk group first, or administering second doses without delay, can often incur higher death rates, hospitalizations, and symptomatic counts. Our framework can be easily adapted to future variants or pandemics through appropriate choice of the compartments of the disease and parameters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Vaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and Methods: The study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. Results: Most outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. Conclusions: In general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Vaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and Methods: The study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. Results: Most outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. Conclusions: In general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLithium is an established first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. Beyond its therapeutic effect as a mood stabiliser, lithium exhibits potential anti-ageing effects. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the duration of lithium use, biological ageing and mortality.

MethodsThe UK Biobank is an observational study of middle-aged and older adults. We tested associations between the duration of lithium use (number of prescriptions, total duration of use, and duration of the first prescription period) and telomere length, frailty, metabolomic age, pulse rate and all-cause mortality.

Results591 individuals (mean age = 57.49 years; 55% females) had been prescribed lithium. There was no evidence that the number of prescriptions ({beta} = -0.022, 95% CI -0.081 to 0.037, p = 0.47), the total duration of use ({beta} = -0.005, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.013, p = 0.57) or the duration of the first prescription period ({beta} = -0.018, 95% CI -0.051 to 0.015, p = 0.29) correlated with telomere length. There was also no evidence that the duration of lithium use correlated with frailty or metabolomic age. However, a higher prescription count or a longer duration of use was associated with a lower pulse rate. The duration of lithium use did not predict mortality.

ConclusionsWe observed no evidence of associations between the duration of lithium use and biological ageing markers, including telomere length. Our findings suggest that the potential anti-ageing effects of lithium do not differ by duration of use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which leads to insulin dependence. We investigated genetic evidence to support the repurposing of seven drugs, already licensed or in clinical phases of development, for prevention of type 1 diabetes.

MethodsWe obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for the risk of type 1 diabetes, whole-blood gene expression, and serum protein levels, and investigated genetic polymorphisms near seven potential drug target genes. We used colocalization to examine whether the same genetic variants that are associated with type 1 diabetes risk were also associated with the relevant drug target genetic proxies, and Mendelian randomization to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the associations. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis restricted to functional variants within the drug target genes.

FindingsColocalization revealed that the blood interleukin (IL)-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL2RA) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) gene expression levels within the corresponding genes shared the same causal variant with type 1 diabetes liability (posterior probabilities 100% and 96.3%, respectively). Odds ratios (OR) of type 1 diabetes per 1-SD increase in the genetically proxied gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R were 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.27) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.48-2.65), respectively. Using missense variants, genetically proxied tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expression levels were associated with type 1 diabetes risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI [0.54-0.70]).

InterpretationOur findings support the targeting of IL-2, IL-6R and TYK2 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further studies should assess the optimal window to intervene to prevent type 1 diabetes.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for GWAS, Mendelian randomization, colocalization, and other studies for genetic evidence of efficacy of targeting IL2RA, IL2RB, IL6R, IL6ST, IL23A, TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3 signaling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. We searched studies with combinations of &#34;IL2RA&#34;, &#34;IL2RB&#34;, &#34;IL6R&#34;, &#34;IL6ST&#34;, &#34;IL23A&#34;, &#34;JAK2&#34;, &#34;JAK3&#34;, &#34;TYK2&#34;, &#34;colocalization&#34;, &#34;mendelian randomization&#34;, or &#34;GWAS&#34; and &#34;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1&#34;[Mesh].

A recent large GWAS by Robertson et al. observed five conditionally independent genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in intergenic and intronic areas near IL2RA. Another large recent GWAS by Chiou et al. found six independent SNPs associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes near IL2RA. A few smaller candidate gene studies also reported associations between the risk of type 1 diabetes and eight other loci near IL2RA. Epigenetic studies reported that a few type 1 diabetes risk variants near IL2RA are associated with changes in methylation of DNA near promoters of IL2RA in white blood cells and B-cells.

Both above mentioned GWAS found associations between two missense mutations in TYK2 gene (rs12720356(A&gt;C), rs34536443(G&gt;C)) and the risk of type 1 diabetes. The same variants protected against type 1 diabetes and some other autoimmune diseases in a Finnish FINNGEN biobank study. Smaller candidate gene studies found that the rs2304256 A/A genotype was protective against type 1 diabetes in a Southern Brazilian and in a European population. In a study of Japanese population, similar association was not seen, possibly due to differences in allele frequencies and incidence of type 1 diabetes between populations. In the same study, TYK2 promoter haplotype with genetic polymorphisms in promoter region and exon 1 decreased the promoter activity and increased the risk for type 1 diabetes. The minor 358Ala allele of the IL6R SNP rs2228145 (A&gt;C) was found to be associated with a reduced risk of developing T1D.

In addition to loci near or at IL2RA and TYK2 loci, the GWAS by Robertson et al. reported an association between rs2229238 near IL6R and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, a candidate gene study found that the GG haplotypes of variants rs11171806 and rs2066808 (in strong LD) near IL23A was protective against T1D.

We found no studies in which colocalization between the loci near the reviewed genes and type 1 diabetes was reported nor estimates from Mendelian randomization on the possible causal relationship. However, Robertson et al. studied the genetic evidence for therapeutic potential of their GWAS hits using a priority index algorithm, which combined information from GWAS of type 1 diabetes, expression quantitative loci in immune cells, evidence from chromatin conformation in immune cells, as well as protein-protein interactions and genomic annotations. Among the reported GWAS hits, priority index ranked IL2RA as the top target, followed by TYK2 (the 3rd target), JAK2 (11th), IL23 (25th), JAK3 (35th), and IL6R (50th).

Added value of this studyWe found that the risk of type 1 diabetes and whole-blood gene expression of IL2RA and IL6R colocalized to rs61839660 near IL2RA and rs10908839 near IL6R, respectively. Using these loci as instruments of IL2RA and IL6R expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that whole blood IL2RA expression is associated with decreased risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.70 per 1 SD increase) whereas IL6R expression is associated with increased risk (OR 1.079 per 1 SD increase). Furthermore, when a missense variant rs2304256 in TYK2 was used as an instrument for TYK2 expression, Mendelian randomization indicated that an SD increase in TYK2 expression was predicted to decrease the risk of type 1 diabetes (OR 0.61).

Implications of all the available evidenceWe found genetic evidence supporting the efficacy of targeting IL-2, IL-6 and TYK2 signalling in prevention of type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to address when would be the most optimal time to intervene in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Multiplex panel tests identify many individual pathogens at once, using a set of component tests. In some panels the number of components can be large. If the panel is detecting causative pathogens for a single syndrome or disease then we might estimate the burden of that disease by combining the results of the panel, for example determining the prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia as caused by many individual pneumococcal serotypes. When we are dealing with multiplex test panels with many components, test error in the individual components of a panel, even when present at very low levels, can cause significant overall error. Uncertainty in the sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests, and statistical fluctuations in the numbers of false positives and false negatives, will cause large uncertainty in the combined estimates of disease prevalence. In many cases this can be a source of significant bias. In this paper we develop a mathematical framework to characterise this issue, present novel statistical methods that adjust for this bias and quantify uncertainty, and use simulation to test these methods. As multiplex testing becomes more commonly used for screening in routine clinical practice, accumulation of test error due to the combination of large numbers of test results needs to be identified and corrected for.

Author summaryDuring analysis of pneumococcal incidence data obtained from serotype specific multiplex urine antigen testing, we identified that despite excellent test sensitivity and specificity, the small error rate in each individual serotype test has the potential to compound and cause large uncertainty in the resulting estimates of pneumococcal prevalence, obtained by combining individual results. This limits the accuracy of estimates of the burden of disease caused by vaccine preventable pneumococcal serotypes, and in certain situations can produce marked bias.</p>
