ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits. ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission. Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. KEY POINTS QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [\u0026ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated? FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received. MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.\nAdverse Events Following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination in Adolescents: A Norwegian Nationwide Register-Based Study\nAuthors: Bergstad Larsen, V.; Gunnes, N.; Gran, J. M.; Boas, H.; Dahl, J.; Viksmoen Watle, S.; Berild, J. D.; Greve-Isdahl, M.; Stoerdal, K.; Gulseth, H.; Karlstad, O.; Lopez-Doriga Ruiz, P.; Tapia, G.\nScore: 502.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299926\nBackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway. Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows. ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression. ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.\nHybrid immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in Canadian adults: cohort study\nAuthors: Brown, P.; Ab-C Study Collaborators, ; Fu, S. H.; Newcombe, L.; Tang, X.; Nagelkerke, N.; Birnboim, H. C.; Bansal, A.; Colwill, K.; Mailhot, G.; Delgado-Brand, M.; Tursun, T.; Qi, F.; Gingras, A.-C.; Slutsky, A. S.; Pasic, M. D.; Companion, J.; Bogoch, I. I.; Morawski, E.; Lam, T.; Reid, A.; Jha, P.\nScore: 89.0, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300588\nBackgroundFew national-level studies have evaluated the impact of \"hybrid\" immunity (vaccination coupled with recovery from infection) from the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. MethodsFrom May 2020 to December 2022, we conducted serial assessments (each of [~]4000-9000 adults) examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a mostly representative Canadian cohort drawn from a national online polling platform. Adults, most of whom were vaccinated, reported viral test-confirmed infections and mailed self-collected dried blood spots to a central lab. Samples underwent highly sensitive and specific antibody assays to spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens, the latter triggered only by infection. We estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence prior to the Omicron period and during the BA.1/1.1 and BA.2/5 waves. We assessed changes in antibody levels and in age-specific active immunity levels. ResultsSpike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses. Among adults vaccinated at least thrice and infected more than six months earlier, spike levels fell notably and continuously for the nine months post-vaccination. By contrast, among adults infected within six months, spike levels declined gradually. Declines were similar by sex, age group, and ethnicity. Recent vaccination attenuated declines in spike levels from older infections. In a convenience sample, spike antibody and cellular responses were correlated. Near the end of 2022, about 35% of adults above age 60 had their last vaccine dose more than six months ago, and about 25% remained uninfected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rose from 13% (95% CI 11-14%) before omicron to 78% (76-80%) by December 2022, equating to 25 million infected adults cumulatively. However, the COVID-19 weekly death rate during the BA.2/5 waves was less than half of that during the BA.1/1.1 wave, implying a protective role for hybrid immunity. ConclusionsStrategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require up-to-date vaccination coverage, including among those recovering from infection. Population-based, self-collected dried blood spots are a practicable biological surveillance platform.

K.; Frigessi, A.; Britton, T.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300755\nWe developed a state-space model to investigate which social behaviours had biggest impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The analyses were based on reported hospitalizations, together with information on vaccinations, weather data, virus strains and, most importantly, Google mobility reports on 4 different types of social activities. While our new approach is general, we studied Sweden and Norway on a regional level over 75 weeks, and the major regions of Berlin and Bavaria in Germany over 10 months. Most results are shared for all three countries: Activity in four social settings explain between 40-60% of all infections; Public transport appears as an important setting for infections in all countries; and the transmission potential drops by 40-50% during the summer as compared to the winter peak. However, the analyses for Germany differ in that Retail and recreation is the other setting dominating transmission whereas it is contacts at the Workplace in Norway and Sweden, showing how our model is able to adapt to specific cases. Transmissions not captured by the Google data may happen in other settings, in particular in households. The statistical model has a deterministic time and region specific transmission rate with an additive component for the four Google settings, and a multiplicative part taking seasonality and circulating virus strains into account. Inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using Stan.\nAssociation of Obstructive Sleep Apnea with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)\nAuthors: Quan, S. F.; Weaver, M. D.; Czeisler, M. E.; Barger, L. K.; Booker, L. A.; Howard, M. E.; Jackson, M. L.; Lane, R. I.; McDonald, C. F.; Ridgers, A.; Robbins, R.; Varma, P.; Wiley, J. F.; Rajaratnam, S.; Czeisler, C. A.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300666\nBackgroundObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with COVID-19 infection. Fewer investigations have assessed OSA as a possible risk for the development of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Research QuestionIn a general population, is OSA associated with increased odds of PASC-related symptoms and with an overall definition of PASC? Study DesignCross-sectional survey of a general population of 24,803 U.S. adults. ResultsCOVID-19 infection occurred in 10,324 (41.6%) participants. Prevalence rates for a wide variety of persistent (\u003e 3 months post infection) putative PASC-related physical and mental health symptoms ranged from 6.5% (peripheral edema) to 19.6% (nervous/anxious). In logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, anthropometric, comorbid medical and socioeconomic factors, OSA was associated with all putative PASC-related symptoms with the highest adjusted odds ratios (aOR) being fever (2.053) and nervous/anxious (1.939) respectively. Elastic net regression identified the 13 of 37 symptoms most strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. Four definitions of PASC were developed using these symptoms either weighted equally or proportionally by their regression coefficients. In all 4 logistic regression models using these definitions, OSA was associated with PASC (range of aORs: 1.934-2.071); this association was mitigated in those with treated OSA. In the best fitting overall model requiring [\u0026ge;]3 symptoms, PASC prevalence was 21.9%. ConclusionIn a general population sample, OSA is associated with the development of PASC-related symptoms and a global definition of PASC. A PASC definition requiring the presence of 3 or more symptoms may be useful in identifying cases and for future research.\nVariations in the results of nutritional epidemiology studies due to analytic flexibility: Application of specification curve analysis to red meat and all-cause mortality\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Pitre, T.; Wallach, J. D.; de Souza, R. J.; Jassal, T.; Bier, D.; Patel, C. J.; Zeraatkar, D.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300248\nObjectiveTo present an application of specification curve analysis--a novel analytic method that involves defining and implementing all plausible and valid analytic approaches for addressing a research question--to nutritional epidemiology. Data sourceNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 to 2014 linked with National Death Index. MethodsWe reviewed all observational studies addressing the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality, sourced from a published systematic review, and documented variations in analytic methods (e.g., choice of model, covariates, etc.). We enumerated all defensible combinations of analytic choices to produce a comprehensive list of all the ways in which the data may reasonably be analyzed. We applied specification curve analysis to NHANES data to investigate the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality, using all reasonable analytic specifications. ResultsAmong 15 publications reporting on 24 cohorts included in the systematic review on red meat and all-cause mortality, we identified 70 unique analytic methods, each including different analytic models, covariates, and operationalizations of red meat (e.g., continuous vs. quantiles). We applied specification curve analysis to NHANES, including 10,661 participants. Our specification curve analysis included 1,208 unique analytic specifications. Of 1,208 specifications, 435 (36.0%) yielded a hazard ratio equal to or above 1 for the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality and 773 (64.0%) below 1, with a median hazard ratio of 0.94 [IQR: 0.83 to 1.05]. Forty-eight specifications (3.97%) were statistically significant, 40 of which indicated unprocessed red meat to reduce all-cause mortality and 8 of which indicated red meat to increase mortality. ConclusionWe show that the application of specification curve analysis to nutritional epidemiology is feasible and presents an innovative solution to analytic flexibility. LimitationsAlternative analytic specifications may address slightly different questions and investigators may disagree about justifiable analytic approaches. Further, specification curve analysis is time and resource-intensive and may not always be feasible.\nDengue virus transmission in Italy: surveillance and epidemiological trends up to 2023\nAuthors: Branda, F.; Nakase, T.; Maruotti, A.; Scarpa, F.; Ciccozzi, A.; Romano, C.; Peletto, S.; Bispo de Filippis, A. M.; Alcantara, L. C. J.; Marcello, A.; Ciccozzi, M.; Lourenco, J.; Giovanetti, M.\nScore: 30.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.23300208\nDengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.\nIdentifying direct risk factors in UK Biobank with simultaneous Bayesian-frequentist model-averaged hypothesis testing using Doublethink\nAuthors: Arning, N.; Fryer, H. R.; Wilson, D. J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.24300687\nBig data approaches to discovering non-genetic risk factors have lagged behind genome-wide association studies that routinely uncover novel genetic risk factors for diverse diseases. Instead, epidemiology typically focuses on candidate risk factors. Since modern biobanks contain thousands of potential risk factors, candidate approaches may introduce bias, inadequately control for multiple testing, and miss important signals. Bayesian model averaging offers a solution, but classical statistics predominates, perhaps because of concern that the prior unduly influences results. Here we show that simultaneous Bayesian and frequentist discovery of direct risk factors is possible via a model-averaged hypothesis testing approach for large samples called Doublethink. Doublethink produces interchangeable posterior odds and p-values that control the false discovery rate (FDR) and familywise error rate (FWER). We implement the Doublethink approach in R and apply it to discover direct risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in 2020 among 1,912 variables in UK Biobank. We find nine exposome-wide significant variables at 9% FDR and 0.05% FWER. These include several commonly reported risk factors (e.g. age, sex, obesity) but exclude others (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension) which might be mediated through variables measuring general comorbidity (e.g. numbers of medications). We identify significant direct effects among infrequently reported risk factors (psychiatric disorders, infection, dementia and aging), and show how testing groups of correlated variables is a useful alternative to pre-analysis variable selection. We discuss the potential for impact and limitations of joint Bayesian-frequentist inference, and the mutual insights afforded into the long-standing differences on statistical approaches to scientific discovery.\nRegression with race-modifiers: towards equity and interpretability\nAuthors: Kowal, D. R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.23300033\nThe pervasive effects of structural racism and racial discrimination are alarming and well-established, and offer strong evidence that the effects of many important variables on health and life outcomes are race-specific. Regression analysis is the predominant statistical tool for estimating and reporting these race-modified effects. However, default numerical encodings of race implicitly elevate one (usually White) race group, leading to racial bias in the presentation of results and, in some cases, racial bias in the estimation and inference for model parameters. We provide an alternative statistical modeling approach using abundance-based constraints (ABCs), which eliminate these biases and deliver more interpretable model parameters. ABCs offer a remarkable invariance property: estimation and inference for main covariate effects are approximately unchanged by the inclusion of race-modifiers. Thus, quantitative researchers can include and estimate race-specific effects \"for free\"--both in terms of model interpretability and statistical efficiency. This framework is especially well-suited for penalized estimation and variable selection (e.g., lasso regression), with meaningful and equitable notions of parameter sparsity and efficient computing strategies. We leverage these statistical tools to estimate the joint effects of multiple environmental, social, and other key factors on 4th end-of-grade readings scores for a large cohort of students (n = 27, 638) in North Carolina, and identify significant race-specific effects for racial (residential) isolation, PM2.5 exposure, and mothers age at birth. Significance StatementThe far-reaching impacts of race suggest that the effects of many key variables on health and life outcomes are modified by race. Alarmingly, we show that standard practices for statistical regression analysis introduce racial biases into the estimation and presentation of these race-specific effects. We introduce an alternative approach that eliminates these racial biases, improves interpretability, and provides unique and appealing statistical properties for estimation and selection of race-specific effects. Using these tools, we identify and quantify race-modifiers for environmental, social, and other key factors on child educational outcomes in North Carolina. Our statistical approach offers high-impact potential to quantify, understand, and ultimately reduce the numerous and significant racial disparities in health and life outcomes.\nDisentangling the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19\nAuthors: Hansen, C. L.; Viboud, C.; Simonsen, L.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300715\nSeveral countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer did not rise during COVID-19 pandemic waves compared to baseline pre-pandemic levels. This is in apparent conflict with findings from cohort studies where cancer has been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Here we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US by testing the impact of death certificate coding changes during the pandemic and leveraging heterogeneity in pandemic intensity across US states. We computed excess mortality from weekly deaths during 2014-2020 nationally and for three states with distinct COVID-19 wave timing (NY, TX, and CA). We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple causes (MC) death data for six types of cancer and high-risk chronic conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimers. Any coding change should be captured in MC data. Nationally in 2020, we found only modest excess MC cancer mortality ([~]12,000 deaths), representing a 2% elevation over baseline. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematologic, 2-5%) than cancers with a poor 5-year survival (lung and pancreatic, 0-1%). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (39%) and Alzheimers (31%). Homing in on the intense spring 2020 COVID-19 wave in NY, mortality elevation was 2-15% for cancer and 126% and 55% for diabetes and Alzheimers, respectively. Simulations based on a demographic model indicate that differences in life expectancy for these conditions, along with the age and size of the at-risk populations, largely explain the observed differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, we found limited elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 waves, even after considering coding changes. Our demographic model predicted low expected excess mortality in populations living with certain types of cancer, even if cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19 fatality risk, due to competing mortality risk. We also find a moderate increase in excess mortality from blood cancers, aligned with other types of observational studies. While our study concentrates on the immediate consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer mortality, further research should consider the pandemic impact on hospitalizations, delayed diagnosis/treatment and risk of Long COVID in cancer patients.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceData describing the early additional protection afforded by recently recommended XBB1.5- adapted COVID-19 vaccines are limited.

ObjectiveWe estimated the association between receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer- BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) and medically attended COVID-19 outcomes among adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsWe performed a test-negative case-control study to compare the odds of BNT162b2 XBB1.5- adapted vaccine receipt between COVID-19 cases and test-negative controls among adults in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system between October 11 and December 10, 2023. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models that were adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics.

ExposureThe primary exposure was receipt of BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind, regardless of prior COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection history. We also compared receipt of prior (non-XBB1.5-adapted) versions of COVID-19 vaccines to the unvaccinated to estimate remaining protection from older vaccines.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases were those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, and controls tested negative. Analyses were done separately for COVID-19 hospital admissions, emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) encounters, and outpatient visits.

ResultsAmong 4232 cases and 19,775 controls with median age of 54 years, adjusted ORs for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among those who received BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine a median of 30 days ago (vs not having received an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind) were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.20-0.67) for COVID-19 hospitalization, 0.42 (0.34-0.53) for ED/UC visits, and 0.42 (0.27-0.66) for outpatient visits. Compared to the unvaccinated, those who had received only older versions of COVID-19 vaccines did not show significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes, including hospital admission.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines given that (1) XBB1.5-adapted vaccines provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes and (2) older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection, including against hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

KEY POINTS

QuestionsDoes receiving the BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine offer additional protection against COVID-19 hospital admission and ambulatory visits in US adults [&amp;ge;]18 years of age compared to not receiving an XBB1.5-adapted vaccine of any kind? Do older versions of COVID-19 vaccine still provide any protection compared to the unvaccinated?

FindingsThe BNT162b2 XBB1.5-adapted vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech 2023-2024 formulation) provided significant additional protection against a range of COVID-19 outcomes during a period when XBB sub-lineages were predominant but JN.1 was also co-circulating and rapidly increasing in prevalence. Older versions of COVID-19 vaccines offered little, if any, additional protection compared to the unvaccinated, including against COVID-19 hospital admission, regardless of the number or type of prior doses received.

MeaningOur findings reaffirm current recommendations for broad age-based use of annually updated COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundVaccination of older adolescents against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the spring of 2021 and continued with younger adolescents throughout the summer and fall. We assessed risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in adolescents aged 12-19 years following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in Norway.

Materials and MethodsThe study sample included 496,432 adolescents born in 2002-2009, residing in Norway, and unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the age-specific waves of vaccination in 2021. The exposures under study were first- and second-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations vs. no dose. We applied Poisson regression and self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 17 preselected outcomes, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects using predefined post-vaccination risk windows.

ResultsMost outcome-specific numbers of cases were low. There were no statistically significant associations between first-dose vaccination and any of the outcomes. In the main Poisson regression, second-dose vaccination was associated with increased risks of anaphylactic reaction (adjusted IRR [aIRR]: 10.05; 95% CI: 1.22-82.74), lymphadenopathy (aIRR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.46-3.72), and myocarditis and pericarditis (aIRR: 5.27; 95% CI: 1.98-14.05). We also observed increased incidence of acute appendicitis outside the 14-day risk window. When expanding the risk window to 42 days in a post-hoc analysis, there was increased incidence of acute appendicitis following both first-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.09-1.78) and second-dose vaccination (aIRR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Results of the SCCS analysis were similar to the Poisson regression.

ConclusionsIn general, potential AEFI were rare among adolescents. We found increased risks of anaphylactic reaction, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis and pericarditis following second-dose vaccination. There were also indications of increased acute appendicitis risk when applying longer risk windows.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFew national-level studies have evaluated the impact of &#34;hybrid&#34; immunity (vaccination coupled with recovery from infection) from the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2.

MethodsFrom May 2020 to December 2022, we conducted serial assessments (each of [~]4000-9000 adults) examining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within a mostly representative Canadian cohort drawn from a national online polling platform. Adults, most of whom were vaccinated, reported viral test-confirmed infections and mailed self-collected dried blood spots to a central lab. Samples underwent highly sensitive and specific antibody assays to spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens, the latter triggered only by infection. We estimated cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence prior to the Omicron period and during the BA.1/1.1 and BA.2/5 waves. We assessed changes in antibody levels and in age-specific active immunity levels.

ResultsSpike levels were higher in infected than in uninfected adults, regardless of vaccination doses. Among adults vaccinated at least thrice and infected more than six months earlier, spike levels fell notably and continuously for the nine months post-vaccination. By contrast, among adults infected within six months, spike levels declined gradually. Declines were similar by sex, age group, and ethnicity. Recent vaccination attenuated declines in spike levels from older infections. In a convenience sample, spike antibody and cellular responses were correlated. Near the end of 2022, about 35% of adults above age 60 had their last vaccine dose more than six months ago, and about 25% remained uninfected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rose from 13% (95% CI 11-14%) before omicron to 78% (76-80%) by December 2022, equating to 25 million infected adults cumulatively. However, the COVID-19 weekly death rate during the BA.2/5 waves was less than half of that during the BA.1/1.1 wave, implying a protective role for hybrid immunity.

ConclusionsStrategies to maintain population-level hybrid immunity require up-to-date vaccination coverage, including among those recovering from infection. Population-based, self-collected dried blood spots are a practicable biological surveillance platform.

        <p class="abstract">We developed a state-space model to investigate which social behaviours had biggest impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The analyses were based on reported hospitalizations, together with information on vaccinations, weather data, virus strains and, most importantly, Google mobility reports on 4 different types of social activities. While our new approach is general, we studied Sweden and Norway on a regional level over 75 weeks, and the major regions of Berlin and Bavaria in Germany over 10 months. Most results are shared for all three countries: Activity in four social settings explain between 40-60% of all infections; Public transport appears as an important setting for infections in all countries; and the transmission potential drops by 40-50% during the summer as compared to the winter peak. However, the analyses for Germany differ in that Retail and recreation is the other setting dominating transmission whereas it is contacts at the Workplace in Norway and Sweden, showing how our model is able to adapt to specific cases. Transmissions not captured by the Google data may happen in other settings, in particular in households. The statistical model has a deterministic time and region specific transmission rate with an additive component for the four Google settings, and a multiplicative part taking seasonality and circulating virus strains into account. Inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using Stan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with COVID-19 infection. Fewer investigations have assessed OSA as a possible risk for the development of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

Research QuestionIn a general population, is OSA associated with increased odds of PASC-related symptoms and with an overall definition of PASC?

Study DesignCross-sectional survey of a general population of 24,803 U.S. adults.

ResultsCOVID-19 infection occurred in 10,324 (41.6%) participants. Prevalence rates for a wide variety of persistent (&gt; 3 months post infection) putative PASC-related physical and mental health symptoms ranged from 6.5% (peripheral edema) to 19.6% (nervous/anxious). In logistic regression models adjusted for demographic, anthropometric, comorbid medical and socioeconomic factors, OSA was associated with all putative PASC-related symptoms with the highest adjusted odds ratios (aOR) being fever (2.053) and nervous/anxious (1.939) respectively. Elastic net regression identified the 13 of 37 symptoms most strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. Four definitions of PASC were developed using these symptoms either weighted equally or proportionally by their regression coefficients. In all 4 logistic regression models using these definitions, OSA was associated with PASC (range of aORs: 1.934-2.071); this association was mitigated in those with treated OSA. In the best fitting overall model requiring [&amp;ge;]3 symptoms, PASC prevalence was 21.9%.

ConclusionIn a general population sample, OSA is associated with the development of PASC-related symptoms and a global definition of PASC. A PASC definition requiring the presence of 3 or more symptoms may be useful in identifying cases and for future research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo present an application of specification curve analysis--a novel analytic method that involves defining and implementing all plausible and valid analytic approaches for addressing a research question--to nutritional epidemiology.

Data sourceNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 to 2014 linked with National Death Index.

MethodsWe reviewed all observational studies addressing the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality, sourced from a published systematic review, and documented variations in analytic methods (e.g., choice of model, covariates, etc.). We enumerated all defensible combinations of analytic choices to produce a comprehensive list of all the ways in which the data may reasonably be analyzed. We applied specification curve analysis to NHANES data to investigate the effect of unprocessed red meat on all-cause mortality, using all reasonable analytic specifications.

ResultsAmong 15 publications reporting on 24 cohorts included in the systematic review on red meat and all-cause mortality, we identified 70 unique analytic methods, each including different analytic models, covariates, and operationalizations of red meat (e.g., continuous vs. quantiles). We applied specification curve analysis to NHANES, including 10,661 participants. Our specification curve analysis included 1,208 unique analytic specifications. Of 1,208 specifications, 435 (36.0%) yielded a hazard ratio equal to or above 1 for the effect of red meat on all-cause mortality and 773 (64.0%) below 1, with a median hazard ratio of 0.94 [IQR: 0.83 to 1.05]. Forty-eight specifications (3.97%) were statistically significant, 40 of which indicated unprocessed red meat to reduce all-cause mortality and 8 of which indicated red meat to increase mortality.

ConclusionWe show that the application of specification curve analysis to nutritional epidemiology is feasible and presents an innovative solution to analytic flexibility.

LimitationsAlternative analytic specifications may address slightly different questions and investigators may disagree about justifiable analytic approaches. Further, specification curve analysis is time and resource-intensive and may not always be feasible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dengue virus circulation is on the rise globally with increased epidemic activity in previously unaffected countries, including within the European region. In 2023, global dengue activity peaked, and Italy reported the highest number of dengue cases and local chains of transmission to date. By curating several sources of information, we introduce a novel data repository focused on dengue reporting in Italy. We integrate geographic, epidemiological, genomic and climatic spatio-temporal data to present an overview of transmission patterns of the past eight years related to circulating viral lineages, geographic distribution, hotspots of reporting, and the theoretical contribution of local climate. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolving scenario in Italy, with the potential to inform reassessment and planning of adequate national and European public health strategies to manage the emergence of dengue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Big data approaches to discovering non-genetic risk factors have lagged behind genome-wide association studies that routinely uncover novel genetic risk factors for diverse diseases. Instead, epidemiology typically focuses on candidate risk factors. Since modern biobanks contain thousands of potential risk factors, candidate approaches may introduce bias, inadequately control for multiple testing, and miss important signals. Bayesian model averaging offers a solution, but classical statistics predominates, perhaps because of concern that the prior unduly influences results. Here we show that simultaneous Bayesian and frequentist discovery of direct risk factors is possible via a model-averaged hypothesis testing approach for large samples called  Doublethink. Doublethink produces interchangeable posterior odds and p-values that control the false discovery rate (FDR) and familywise error rate (FWER). We implement the Doublethink approach in R and apply it to discover direct risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in 2020 among 1,912 variables in UK Biobank. We find nine exposome-wide significant variables at 9% FDR and 0.05% FWER. These include several commonly reported risk factors (e.g. age, sex, obesity) but exclude others (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension) which might be mediated through variables measuring general comorbidity (e.g. numbers of medications). We identify significant direct effects among infrequently reported risk factors (psychiatric disorders, infection, dementia and aging), and show how testing groups of correlated variables is a useful alternative to pre-analysis variable selection. We discuss the potential for impact and limitations of joint Bayesian-frequentist inference, and the mutual insights afforded into the long-standing differences on statistical approaches to scientific discovery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The pervasive effects of structural racism and racial discrimination are alarming and well-established, and offer strong evidence that the effects of many important variables on health and life outcomes are race-specific. Regression analysis is the predominant statistical tool for estimating and reporting these race-modified effects. However, default numerical encodings of race implicitly elevate one (usually White) race group, leading to racial bias in the presentation of results and, in some cases, racial bias in the estimation and inference for model parameters. We provide an alternative statistical modeling approach using abundance-based constraints (ABCs), which eliminate these biases and deliver more interpretable model parameters. ABCs offer a remarkable invariance property: estimation and inference for main covariate effects are approximately unchanged by the inclusion of race-modifiers. Thus, quantitative researchers can include and estimate race-specific effects &#34;for free&#34;--both in terms of model interpretability and statistical efficiency. This framework is especially well-suited for penalized estimation and variable selection (e.g., lasso regression), with meaningful and equitable notions of parameter sparsity and efficient computing strategies. We leverage these statistical tools to estimate the joint effects of multiple environmental, social, and other key factors on 4th end-of-grade readings scores for a large cohort of students (n = 27, 638) in North Carolina, and identify significant race-specific effects for racial (residential) isolation, PM2.5 exposure, and mothers age at birth.

Significance StatementThe far-reaching impacts of race suggest that the effects of many key variables on health and life outcomes are modified by race. Alarmingly, we show that standard practices for statistical regression analysis introduce racial biases into the estimation and presentation of these race-specific effects. We introduce an alternative approach that eliminates these racial biases, improves interpretability, and provides unique and appealing statistical properties for estimation and selection of race-specific effects. Using these tools, we identify and quantify race-modifiers for environmental, social, and other key factors on child educational outcomes in North Carolina. Our statistical approach offers high-impact potential to quantify, understand, and ultimately reduce the numerous and significant racial disparities in health and life outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer did not rise during COVID-19 pandemic waves compared to baseline pre-pandemic levels. This is in apparent conflict with findings from cohort studies where cancer has been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Here we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US by testing the impact of death certificate coding changes during the pandemic and leveraging heterogeneity in pandemic intensity across US states. We computed excess mortality from weekly deaths during 2014-2020 nationally and for three states with distinct COVID-19 wave timing (NY, TX, and CA). We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple causes (MC) death data for six types of cancer and high-risk chronic conditions such as diabetes and Alzheimers. Any coding change should be captured in MC data.

Nationally in 2020, we found only modest excess MC cancer mortality ([~]12,000 deaths), representing a 2% elevation over baseline. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematologic, 2-5%) than cancers with a poor 5-year survival (lung and pancreatic, 0-1%). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (39%) and Alzheimers (31%). Homing in on the intense spring 2020 COVID-19 wave in NY, mortality elevation was 2-15% for cancer and 126% and 55% for diabetes and Alzheimers, respectively. Simulations based on a demographic model indicate that differences in life expectancy for these conditions, along with the age and size of the at-risk populations, largely explain the observed differences in excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In conclusion, we found limited elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 waves, even after considering coding changes. Our demographic model predicted low expected excess mortality in populations living with certain types of cancer, even if cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19 fatality risk, due to competing mortality risk. We also find a moderate increase in excess mortality from blood cancers, aligned with other types of observational studies. While our study concentrates on the immediate consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer mortality, further research should consider the pandemic impact on hospitalizations, delayed diagnosis/treatment and risk of Long COVID in cancer patients.</p>
