DesignRetrospective cohort study. SettingEngland, United Kingdom, from 21 March 2021 to March 2022 ParticipantsAll individuals in the 2021 Census, aged 0 to 95 with an Emergency Department attendance record within the Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS). Our full sample included 51,776,958 individuals and 11,498,520 A\u0026E attendance records. Main outcome measuresThe primary outcome was any visit to an Accident and Emergency service in England between 21st March 2021 and 31st March 2022 as recorded in ECDS. ResultsAfter adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, the odds of A\u0026E attendance increased as the level of deprivation increased, with the odds for those in the most deprived decile being 1.69 (95% CI - 1.68 to 1.69) times greater than those in the least deprived decile. Adjusting for underlying health attenuated but did not fully explain the association between deprivation and A\u0026E attendance, with the odds ratio of attendance for those in the most deprived decile reduced to 1.41 (95% CI - 1.40 to 1.41). This pattern was similar across age groups however the gradient of the slope was steeper for working age adults and the magnitude of the reduction in odds for the most deprived decile relative to the least deprived decile after adjusting for health was greatest in those aged 30 to 79. By acuity, those living in the most deprived decile had 2.26 times (95% CI = 2.23 to 2.28) higher odds of attending A\u0026E for a condition classified as low acuity compared with those in the least deprived decile. Even after adjusting for health, those in the most deprived decile had 2.02 (95% CI = 1.99 to 2.02) times the odds of attending for a low acuity condition compared with those in the least deprived decile. This was true for all levels of acuity, except those classified as immediate care, where after adjustment for health, those in the most deprived decile had 0.83 (95% CI = 0.82 to 0.85) times the odds of attendance compared with those in the least deprived decile. ConclusionsPeople living in more deprived areas were more likely to access A\u0026E services than those living in less deprived areas and these differences are not fully explained by differences in underlying health. The differences were larger for A\u0026E attendance for less severe conditions. Differences in access to primary care services may explain part of these differences in A\u0026E access. Knowing which groups are more likely to attend A\u0026E services will give valuable insight for health services providers, and allow decision makers to better understand how populations can access care differently depending on a range of factors.
