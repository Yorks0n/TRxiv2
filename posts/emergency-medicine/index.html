T.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24301668\nBackgroundOn 19 January 2020, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was identified in the US, with the first cases in South Carolina (SC) confirmed on 06 March 2020. Due to initial limited testing capabilities and potential for asymptomatic transmission, it is possible that the virus was present earlier than previously thought while preexisting immunity in at-risk populations was unknown. MethodsSalivary samples from 55 SC emergency department physicians, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers, and medical students working as EMTs were collected from September 2019 to March 2020 as part of a separate study and stored frozen. To determine if antibody-based immunity to SARS-CoV-2 was present prior to the first recorded cases, saliva acquired post-shift was analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay with repeat of positive or inconclusive results and follow-up testing of pre-shift samples. ResultsTwo participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2-reactive salivary IgG, confirmed by repeat and follow-up testing. Positive samples were from medical students working in EMS and were collected in October or November of 2019. ConclusionsThe presence of detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 suggests that immunity existed in SC, and the US as a whole, prior to the earliest documented cases of COVID-19. Additionally, successful analysis of banked salivary samples demonstrates the feasibility of saliva as a noninvasive tool for surveillance of emerging outbreaks. These findings suggest that emergency healthcare providers represent a high-risk population that should be the focus of infectious disease surveillance. Article SummaryRetrospective SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of saliva from emergency healthcare workers pre-pandemic identifies two reactive individuals in late 2019. Findings suggest the importance of emergency healthcare workers for infectious disease surveillance and saliva as an effective diagnostic tool.\nIncidence of Mortality and Predictors Among Patients with Shock Managed in the Emergency Room of a Large Tertiary Referral Hospital in Ethiopia\nAuthors: Asfaw (MD), K. G.; Adugna (MD, A. G.; Mekonen (MD), N. M.; Leulseged (MD, MPH), T. W.; Merahi (MD, MPH), M. K.; Kejela (MD), S.; Moges (MD), F. H.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-02-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.10.24302628\nBackground: Shock is a common emergency condition which can lead to organ failure and death if not diagnosed and managed timely. Despite its huge global impact, data is scarce in resource-limited settings, such as Ethiopia, which hinders the provision of quality care for improved patient outcomes. Hence, the aim of the study was to determine the incidence of death and predictors among adult patients with shock managed at the Emergency Department of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College in Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective chart review study was conducted between July to September 2022 among 178 eligible adult patients who were managed at hospital between October 2021 and May 2022. The characteristics of the participants were summarized using frequency and median with interquartile range. The incidence of mortality was estimated using incidence density using person hour (PH) of observation. To identify predictors of mortality, a generalized linear model using poisson regression model with robust standard errors was run at 5% level of significance, where adjusted relative risk (ARR) with its 95% CI was used to interpret significant results Result: The incidence of death was 6.87 deaths per 1000 PH (95% CI= 5.44 to 8.69). Significant predictors of death were being triaged orange (ARR=0.46, 95% CI=0.24-0.88, p=0.020), having a high shock index (ARR=1.59, 95% CI=1.07-2.36, p=0.021), being diagnosed with septic shock (ARR=3.66, 95% CI=1.20-11.17, p=0.023), taking vasopressors (ARR=3.18, 95% CI=1.09, 9.27, p=0.034), and developing organ failure (ARR=1.79, 95% CI=1.04-3.07, p=0.035). Conclusion: The incidence of mortality among shock patients was found to be considerable but relatively lower than previous studies. To optimize patient care and improve outcomes, it is important to remain vigilant in the proper triage and early diagnosis of shock using more sensitive tools for prompt identification of high-risk cases, as well as to provide timely, prioritized and effective interventions.\n",
