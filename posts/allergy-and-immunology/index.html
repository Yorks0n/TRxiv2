  "articleBody": " Rhinovirus infection of airway epithelial cells uncovers the non-ciliated subset as a likely driver of genetic susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma\nAuthors: Djeddi, S.; Fermandez-Salinas, D.; Huang, G.; Aguiar, V.; Mohanty, C.; Kendziorski, C.; Gazal, S.; Boyce, J.; Ober, C.; Gern, J.; Barrett, N.; Gutierrez-Arcelus, M.\nScore: 18.3, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302068\nAsthma is a complex disease caused by genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies have shown that in children, wheezing during rhinovirus infection (a cause of the common cold) is associated with asthma development during childhood. This has led scientists to hypothesize there could be a causal relationship between rhinovirus infection and asthma or that RV-induced wheezing identifies individuals at increased risk for asthma development. However, not all children who wheeze when they have a cold develop asthma. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants contributing to asthma susceptibility, with the vast majority of likely causal variants being non-coding. Integrative analyses with transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets have indicated that T cells drive asthma risk, which has been supported by mouse studies. However, the datasets ascertained in these integrative analyses lack airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, large-scale transcriptomic T cell studies have not identified the regulatory effects of most non-coding risk variants in asthma GWAS, indicating there could be additional cell types harboring these \"missing regulatory effects\". Given that airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense against rhinovirus, we hypothesized they could be mediators of genetic susceptibility to asthma. Here we integrate GWAS data with transcriptomic datasets of airway epithelial cells subject to stimuli that could induce activation states relevant to asthma. We demonstrate that epithelial cultures infected with rhinovirus significantly upregulate childhood-onset asthma-associated genes. We show that this upregulation occurs specifically in non-ciliated epithelial cells. This enrichment for genes in asthma risk loci, or asthma heritability enrichment is also significant for epithelial genes upregulated with influenza infection, but not with SARS-CoV-2 infection or cytokine activation. Additionally, cells from patients with asthma showed a stronger heritability enrichment compared to cells from healthy individuals. Overall, our results suggest that rhinovirus infection is an environmental factor that interacts with genetic risk factors through non-ciliated airway epithelial cells to drive childhood-onset asthma.\nThe assembly of neutrophil inflammasomes during COVID-19 is mediated by type I interferons\nAuthors: Cabrera, L. E.; Jokiranta, S. T.; Mäki, S.; Miettinen, S.; Kant, R.; Kareinen, L.; Sironen, T.; Pietilä, J.-P.; Kantele, A.; Kekäläinen, E.; Lindgren, H.; Mattila, P.; Kipar, A.; Vapalahti, O.; Strandin, T.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.23295190\nThe severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes, which was confirmed in a COVID-19 mouse model. These findings underscore the crucial role of neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.\nRepeated Hand Grip Strength is an Objective Marker for Disability and Severity of Key Symptoms in Post-COVID ME/CFS\nAuthors: Paffrath, A.; Kim, L.; Kedor, C.; Stein, E.; Rust, R.; Freitag, H.; Hoppmann, U.; Hanitsch, L. G.; Bellmann-Strobl, J.; Wittke, K.; Scheibenbogen, C.; Sotzny, F.\nScore: 94.3, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301776\nPost-COVID Syndrome (PCS) refers to a diverse array of symptoms that persist beyond 3 months of the acute phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequent symptom is fatigue, which can manifest both mentally and physically. In this study, handgrip strength (HGS) parameters were determined as an objective measure of muscle fatigue and fatigability. HGS parameters were correlated with other frequent symptoms among 144 female PCS patients suffering from fatigue, exertional intolerance, and cognitive impairment. Seventy-eight patients met the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The severity of disability and key symptoms were evaluated utilizing self-reported questionnaires. Notably, patients diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibited a higher overall severity of symptoms, including lower physical function (p \u003c 0.001), a greater degree of disability (p \u003c 0.001), more severe fatigue (p \u003c 0.001), post-exertional malaise (p \u003c 0.001), and autonomic dysfunction (p = 0.004). While HGS was similarly impaired in both PCS and ME/CFS patients, the associations between HGS and the severity of symptoms and disability revealed striking differences. We observed significant correlations of HGS parameters with physical function across all patients, but with the key symptoms PEM, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS patients only. This points to a common mechanism for these symptoms in the ME/CFS subtype, distinct from that in other types of PCS. Further HGS provides an objective marker of disease severity in ME/CFS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) refers to a diverse array of symptoms that persist beyond 3 months of the acute phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequent symptom is fatigue, which can manifest both mentally and physically. In this study, handgrip strength (HGS) parameters were determined as an objective measure of muscle fatigue and fatigability. HGS parameters were correlated with other frequent symptoms among 144 female PCS patients suffering from fatigue, exertional intolerance, and cognitive impairment. Seventy-eight patients met the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The severity of disability and key symptoms were evaluated utilizing self-reported questionnaires. Notably, patients diagnosed with ME/CFS exhibited a higher overall severity of symptoms, including lower physical function (p &lt; 0.001), a greater degree of disability (p &lt; 0.001), more severe fatigue (p &lt; 0.001), post-exertional malaise (p &lt; 0.001), and autonomic dysfunction (p = 0.004). While HGS was similarly impaired in both PCS and ME/CFS patients, the associations between HGS and the severity of symptoms and disability revealed striking differences. We observed significant correlations of HGS parameters with physical function across all patients, but with the key symptoms PEM, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS patients only. This points to a common mechanism for these symptoms in the ME/CFS subtype, distinct from that in other types of PCS. Further HGS provides an objective marker of disease severity in ME/CFS.</p>
