      <description>Effects of Buprenorphine, Methadone and Substance-Use on COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality
Authors: CHRISTIAN, N.; ZHOU, X.; RADHAKRISHNAN, R.
Score: 4.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298995
ObjectivesSubstance use disorder has been associated with increased morbidity in COVID-19 infection. However, less is known about the impact of active substance use and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) on COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of substance use, namely cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, sedative and opioid use as well as buprenorphine or methadone = on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.</description>

Score: 947.3, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298544
ImportanceEarlier research on COVID-19 vaccines identified a range of adverse reactions related to proinflammatory actions that can lead to an excessive immune response and sustained inflammation. However, no study has been conducted on the association between inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders and COVID-19 vaccines. ObjectiveTo investigate the incidence rates of inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders following COVID-19 vaccination and to compare them with those of unvaccinated individuals.</description>

Authors: Recalde, N. M.; Estandia, A.; Keen, S. C.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.
Score: 23.9, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452
Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability.</description>

Cas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments. However, in vitro studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg2&amp;#43; concentrations that would be present in cells.</description>

Single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) allows quantifying proteins with high specificity and sensitivity. To increase its throughput, we developed nPOP, a method for parallel preparation of thousands of single cells in nanoliter volume droplets deposited on glass slides.

Score: 31.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568764
The design of regulatory elements is pivotal in numerous therapeutic interventions, including gene and cell therapy, wherein the typical objective is to engineer DNA sequences exhibiting specific attributes like cell-type specificity and elevated expression levels. However, the systematic assessment of these constructed DNA sequences remains challenging due to the absence of robust metrics and an integrated software framework.</description>

Score: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569057
Excitatory neurotransmission is principally mediated by AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Dysregulation of AMPARs is the cause of many neurological disorders and how therapeutic candidates such as negative allosteric modulators inhibit AMPARs is unclear. Here, we show that non-competitive inhibition desensitizes AMPARs to activation and prevents positive allosteric modulation.</description>

Developing a universal representation of cells which encompasses the tremendous molecular diversity of cell types within the human body and more generally, across species, would be transformative for cell biology.

Score: 24.9, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298919
Epidemic models often heavily simplify the dynamics of human-to-human contacts, but the resulting bias in outbreak dynamics - and hence requirements for control measures - remains unclear. Even if high resolution temporal contact data were routinely used for modelling, the role of this temporal network structure towards outbreak control is not well characterised.</description>

Score: 28.2, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.02.569704
Apparent time-scaling of evolutionary rates presents an evolutionary dilemma; rates of molecular, phenotypic, and lineage diversification scale strongly negatively with timeframe of measurement, raising questions about the processes driving this general pattern. Here we show that much of this apparent temporal scaling is an inevitable outcome of plotting a ratio against its denominator.</description>

      <description>Extreme miniaturization in plasmid design: generation of the 903 bp cloning vector pICOt2
Authors: Staal, J.; Beyaert, R.
Score: 40.9, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569326
Inspired by the size optimizations in the recently published pUdO series of plasmids, we set out to break our previous world record (pICOz, 1185 bp) in designing the smallest possible self-replicating high copy cloning vector. By replacing the zeocin resistance marker with trimethoprim resistance, deleting the parts upstream of -35 in the ampicilin resistance promoter and replacing the extended multiple cloning site with a single SpeI site, we managed to reduce the plasmid size to 903 bp, almost a 24% reduction in size compared to our previous world record.</description>

      <description>A Spatial Comparison of Molecular Features Associated with Resistance to Pembrolizumab in BCG Unresponsive Bladder Cancer
Authors: Meghani, K.; Frydenlund, N.; Yu, Y.; Choy, B.; Meeks, J. J.
Score: 11.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299093
BackgroundIntravenous immune checkpoint inhibition achieves a 40% three-month response in BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS). Yet only half of early responders will continue to be disease free by 12 months, and resistance mechanisms are poorly defined.</description>

      <description>Hydrothermal vent fauna of the Galapagos Rift: Updated species list with new records
Authors: Chen, C.; Jamieson, J. W.; Tunnicliffe, V.
Score: 29.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.568903
The sighting of giant bivalves and tubeworms at the Rose Garden vent field on the Galapagos Rift in 1977 marked the discovery of hydrothermal vents, a turning point for modern biology. The following decade saw a flurry of taxonomic descriptions of vent endemic species from the first vents.</description>
