Allergic rhinitis has increased in the last fifty years from affecting less than a percent to more than twenty-six percent of the population[1]. Today, more than one hundred million people in the US suffer from these seasonal or yearlong allergies[2]. The hygiene hypothesis was proposed 30 years ago as a potential explanation for this phenomenon[3], and we built on that with the specific oral hygiene hypothesis[4].</description>

      <description>ChatGPT identifies gender disparities in scientific peer review
Authors: Verharen, J. P. H.
Score: 6.8, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549552
The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports.</description>

      <description>xTrimoPGLM: Unified 100B-Scale Pre-trained Transformer for Deciphering the Language of Protein
Authors: Chen, B.; Cheng, X.; Gengyang, L.-a.; Li, S.; Zeng, X.; Wang, B.; Gong, J.; Liu, C.; Zeng, A.; Dong, Y.; Tang, J.; Song, L.
Score: 98.1, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547496
Protein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently.</description>
