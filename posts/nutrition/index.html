Based on recent evidence that ketone ester (KE) intake attenuates hypoxemia, we sought to investigate whether exogenous ketosis might mitigate AMS development and improve hypoxic tolerance. MethodsFourteen healthy, male participants were enrolled in two 29h protocols (simulated altitude of 4,000-4,500m) receiving either KE or a placebo (CON) at regular timepoints throughout the protocol in a randomized, crossover manner. Select physiological responses were characterized after 15min and 4h in hypoxia, and the protocol was terminated prematurely upon development of severe AMS. ResultsAll participants tolerated the protocol equally long (n=6, of which n=5 completed the protocol in both conditions) or longer (n=8) in KE. Overall protocol duration increased by 32% on average with KE, and doubled for AMS-developing participants. KE consistently induced diurnal ketosis, a mild metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, and relative sympathetic dominance. KE also fully negated the progressive hypoxemia that was observed between 15min and 4h in hypoxia in CON, while concomitantly increasing cerebral oxygenation and capillary pO2 within this timeframe. This coincided with a KE-induced reduction in cerebral oxygen supply, suggesting that KE reduced cerebral oxygen consumption under hypoxic conditions. ConclusionsThese data indicate that exogenous ketosis improves hypoxic tolerance in humans and attenuates AMS development. The key underlying mechanisms include improved arterial and cerebral oxygenation, in combination with lowered cerebral blood flow and oxygen demand, and increased sympathetic dominance. SummaryKetone ester intake attenuated the development of acute mountain sickness at a simulated altitude of 4,000-4,500m. This likely resulted from a mitigation of arterial and cerebral hypoxemia, reduced cerebral blood flow and increased sympathetic drive.\nEffects of Maternal Fortified Balanced Energy-Protein Supplementation on the Mother-Infant Gut Microbiome: A Sub-Study of the MISAME-III Randomized Controlled Trial\nAuthors: Deng, L.; Taelman, S.; Olm, M. R.; Toe, L. C.; Balini, E.; Ouedraogo, L.; Bastos-Moreira, Y.; Argaw, A.; Tesfamariam, K.; Sonnenburg, E. D.; Ouedraogo, M.; Ganaba, R.; Criekinge, W. v.; Kolsteren, P.; Stock, M.; Lachat, C.; Sonnenburg, J. L.; Dailey-Chwalibog, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298964\nBiological pathways, including individual gut microbiome are potential barriers for maternal nutritional supplementation to improvement in infant growth. We evaluated the impact of balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplementation during pregnancy and the first six months of lactation on the composition and functionality of gut microbiome in mothers and their infants in rural Burkina Faso. Our findings reveal that BEP supplementation led to a significant increase in microbiome diversity during pregnancy. In the second trimester, there was a notable decrease in the abundance of an Oscillospiraceae species, while postpartum, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis increased. We identified concerted enriched or depleted microbial pathways associated with BEP supplementation, including the phosphotransferase system, a critical mechanism for bacterial carbohydrates uptake, which exhibited enrichment in infants born to BEP-supplemented mothers. Despite these observations, the intricate biological connections with other omics necessitate further analysis to fully elucidate the underlying comprehensive biological pathways.\nMetabolic variation reflects dietary intake in a multi-ethnic Asian population\nAuthors: Low, D. Y.; Mina, T.; Sadhu, N.; Wong, K.; Jain, P. R.; Dalan, R.; Ng, H. K.; Xie, W.; Lam, B. C. C.; Tay, D.; Wang, X.; Yew, Y. W.; Best, J.; Sarangarajan, R.; Elliott, P.; Riboli, E.; Lee, J.; Lee, E. S.; Ngeow, J.; Sheridan, P.; Michelotti, G.; Loh, M.; Chambers, J.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299350\nDietary biomarkers reflecting habitual diet are explored largely in European and American populations. However, the food metabolome is highly complex, with its composition varying to region and culture. Here, by assessing 1,055 plasma metabolites and 169 foods/beverages in 8,391 comprehensively phenotyped individuals from the multi-ethnic Asian HELIOS cohort (69% Chinese, 12% Malay, 19% South Asian), we report novel observations for ethnic-relevant and common foods. Using machine-learning feature selection approach, we developed dietary multi-biomarker panels (3-39 metabolites each) for key foods and beverages in respective training sets. These panels comprised distinct and shared metabolite networks, and captured variances in intake prediction models in test sets better than single biomarkers. Composite metabolite scores, derived from the biomarker panels, associated significantly and more strongly with clinical phenotypes (HOMA-IR, type 2 diabetes, BMI, fat mass index, carotid intima-media thickness and hypertension), compared to self-reported intakes. Lastly, in 235 individuals that returned for a repeat visit (averaged 322 days apart), diet-metabolite relationships were robust over time, with predicted intakes, derived from biomarker panels and metabolite scores, showing better reproducibility than self-reported intakes. Altogether, our findings show new insights into multi-ethnic diet-related metabolic variations and new opportunity to link exposure to health outcomes in Asian populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dietary biomarkers reflecting habitual diet are explored largely in European and American populations. However, the food metabolome is highly complex, with its composition varying to region and culture. Here, by assessing 1,055 plasma metabolites and 169 foods/beverages in 8,391 comprehensively phenotyped individuals from the multi-ethnic Asian HELIOS cohort (69% Chinese, 12% Malay, 19% South Asian), we report novel observations for ethnic-relevant and common foods. Using machine-learning feature selection approach, we developed dietary multi-biomarker panels (3-39 metabolites each) for key foods and beverages in respective training sets. These panels comprised distinct and shared metabolite networks, and captured variances in intake prediction models in test sets better than single biomarkers. Composite metabolite scores, derived from the biomarker panels, associated significantly and more strongly with clinical phenotypes (HOMA-IR, type 2 diabetes, BMI, fat mass index, carotid intima-media thickness and hypertension), compared to self-reported intakes. Lastly, in 235 individuals that returned for a repeat visit (averaged 322 days apart), diet-metabolite relationships were robust over time, with predicted intakes, derived from biomarker panels and metabolite scores, showing better reproducibility than self-reported intakes. Altogether, our findings show new insights into multi-ethnic diet-related metabolic variations and new opportunity to link exposure to health outcomes in Asian populations.</p>
