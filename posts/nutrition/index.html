I.\nScore: 24.8, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23293998\nEvidence is accumulating that perturbed postnatal development of the gut microbiome contributes to childhood malnutrition1-4. Designing effective microbiome-directed therapeutic foods to repair these perturbations requires knowledge about how food components interact with the microbiome to alter its expressed functions. Here we use biospecimens from a randomized, controlled trial of a microbiome-directed complementary food prototype (MDCF-2) that produced superior rates of weight gain compared to a conventional ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) in 12-18-month-old Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)4. We reconstructed 1000 bacterial genomes (metagenome-assembled genomes, MAGs) present in their fecal microbiomes, identified 75 whose abundances were positively associated with weight gain (change in weight-for-length Z score, WLZ), characterized gene expression changes in these MAGs as a function of treatment type and WLZ response, and used mass spectrometry to quantify carbohydrate structures in MDCF-2 and feces. The results reveal treatment-induced changes in expression of carbohydrate metabolic pathways in WLZ-associated MAGs. Comparing participants consuming MDCF-2 versus RUSF, and MDCF-2-treated children in the upper versus lower quartiles of WLZ responses revealed that two Prevotella copri MAGs positively associated with WLZ were principal contributors to MDCF-2-induced expression of metabolic pathways involved in utilization of its component glycans. Moreover, the predicted specificities of carbohydrate active enzymes expressed by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in these two MAGs correlate with the (i) in vitro growth of Bangladeshi P. copri strains, possessing differing degrees of PUL and overall genomic content similarity to these MAGs, cultured in defined medium containing different purified glycans representative of those in MDCF-2, and (ii) levels of carbohydrate structures identified in feces from clinical trial participants. In the accompanying paper5, we use a gnotobiotic mouse model colonized with age- and WLZ-associated bacterial taxa cultured from this study population, and fed diets resembling those consumed by study participants, to directly test the relationship between P. copri, MDCF-2 glycan metabolism, host ponderal growth responses, and intestinal gene expression and metabolism. The ability to identify bioactive glycan structures in MDCFs that are metabolized by growth-associated bacterial taxa will help guide recommendations about use of this MDCF for children with acute malnutrition representing different geographic locales and ages, as well as enable development of bioequivalent, or more efficacious, formulations composed of culturally acceptable and affordable ingredients.\nThe plasma proteome of plant-based diets: analyses of 1463 proteins in 50,000 people\nAuthors: Tong, T. Y.; Smith-Byrne, K.; Papier, K.; Atkins, J. R.; Parsaeian, M.; Key, T. J.; Travis, R. C.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294084\nBackground and objectivesCirculating proteins are integral to many biological processes. We aimed to assess differences in the plasma proteome between people of different dietary groups defined by degree of animal food consumption. MethodsThe UK Biobank recruited middle-aged adults (mostly 40 to 69 years) throughout the UK between 2006-2010. Relative concentrations of 1463 plasma proteins were quantified using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay on blood samples from 49,326 participants, who were also asked to report their ethnicity and consumption of red and processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs. We defined six diet groups among the white British participants (23,116 regular meat eaters, 23,323 low meat eaters, 484 poultry eaters, 1074 fish eaters, 722 vegetarians, and 54 vegans), and two diet groups among the British Indians (390 meat eaters and 163 vegetarians). We used multivariable-adjusted linear regressions to assess differences in protein concentrations between diet groups, with correction for multiple testing. ResultsWe observed significant differences in many plasma proteins by diet group (683 proteins in white British participants, 1 in British Indians), in particular many proteins that are majority expressed in the digestive system. Of the biggest differences, compared with regular meat eaters, the non-meat eaters had significantly higher FGF21 (e.g. +0.40 SD in vegetarians), GUCA2A (+0.33), FOLR1 (+0.32), IGFBP2 (+0.31) and DSG2 (+0.30); all groups except the vegans had lower HAVCR1 (-0.38 in vegetarians). The observed differences were generally similar in direction in both ethnicities. DiscussionIn this first comprehensive assessment of plasma proteins by diet group, we identified many differences in proteins between groups defined by animal food consumption; this variation in protein levels suggests differences in various biological activities, including gastrointestinal tract and kidney function, which may relate to differences in future disease risk.\nFood \u0026 You: A Digital Cohort on Personalized Nutrition\nAuthors: Heritier, H.; Allemann, C.; Balakiriev, O.; Boulanger, V.; Carroll, S. F.; Froidevaux, N.; Hugon, G.; Jaquet, Y.; Kebaili, D.; Riccardi, S.; Rousseau-Leupin, G.; Salathe, R. M.; Salzmann, T.; Singh, R.; Symul, L.; Ugurlu-Baud, E.; De Verteuil, P.; Salathe, M.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.24.23290445\nNutrition is a key contributor to health. Recently, several studies have identified associations between factors such as microbiota composition and health-related responses to dietary intake, raising the potential of personalized nutritional recommendations. To further our understanding of personalized nutrition, detailed individual data must be collected from participants in their day-to-day lives. However, this is challenging in conventional studies that require clinical measurements and site visits. So-called digital or remote cohorts allow in situ data collection on a daily basis through mobile applications, online services, and wearable sensors, but they raise questions about study retention and data quality. \"Food \u0026 You\" is a personalized nutrition study implemented as a fully digital cohort in which participants track food intake, physical activity, gut microbiota, glycemia, and other data for two to four weeks. Here, we describe the study protocol, report on study completion rates, and describe the collected data, focusing on assessing their quality and reliability. Overall, the study collected data from over 1000 participants, including high-resolution data of nutritional intake of more than 46 million kcal collected from 315,126 dishes over 23,335 participant days, 1,470,030 blood glucose measurements, 49,110 survey responses, and 867 stool samples for gut microbiota analysis. Retention was high, with over 60% of the enrolled participants completing the study. Various data quality assessment efforts suggest the captured high-resolution nutritional data accurately reflect individual diet patterns, paving the way for digital cohorts as a typical study design for personalized nutrition.\nThe impact of live dietary microbes on health: a scoping review\nAuthors: Iyer, A.; Mukherjee, A.; Gomez-Sala, B.; O'Connor, E. M.; Kenny, J. G.; Cotter, P. D.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23294168\nBackground: A systematic approach to collect, peruse and summarise the available information relating to the potential benefits of consuming dietary microbes was pursued in this scoping review. This review focused on the research endpoints, experimental designs, and microbial exposure in experimental as well as observational research work. Approach: Using a structured-set of keywords, scientific databases were systematically searched to retrieve publications reporting outcomes pertaining to the use of dietary-microbes in healthy, non-patient populations. Searches were further tailored to focus on eight different health categories, namely, antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD), gastrointestinal health (GIH), immunological health (ImH), cardiovascular health and metabolic syndrome (CvHMS), cancer prevention (CanPr), respiratory health (ReH), weight management (WtMgt), and urogenital health (UrGH). Quality of evidence available in each publication was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. Result: The search yielded 228 relevant publications describing 282 experimental cases comprising 62 research endpoints overall. A microbial dose of 2x109 CFU/day was associated with non-negative reported outcomes. Older population groups with a median age of 39 years were associated with positive outcomes. Conclusion: More high-quality research is required investigating the role of dietary microbes in maintaining general health, particularly in the health categories of urogenital health, weight management and cancer prevention.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background and objectivesCirculating proteins are integral to many biological processes. We aimed to assess differences in the plasma proteome between people of different dietary groups defined by degree of animal food consumption.

MethodsThe UK Biobank recruited middle-aged adults (mostly 40 to 69 years) throughout the UK between 2006-2010. Relative concentrations of 1463 plasma proteins were quantified using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay on blood samples from 49,326 participants, who were also asked to report their ethnicity and consumption of red and processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs. We defined six diet groups among the white British participants (23,116 regular meat eaters, 23,323 low meat eaters, 484 poultry eaters, 1074 fish eaters, 722 vegetarians, and 54 vegans), and two diet groups among the British Indians (390 meat eaters and 163 vegetarians). We used multivariable-adjusted linear regressions to assess differences in protein concentrations between diet groups, with correction for multiple testing.

ResultsWe observed significant differences in many plasma proteins by diet group (683 proteins in white British participants, 1 in British Indians), in particular many proteins that are majority expressed in the digestive system. Of the biggest differences, compared with regular meat eaters, the non-meat eaters had significantly higher FGF21 (e.g. &#43;0.40 SD in vegetarians), GUCA2A (&#43;0.33), FOLR1 (&#43;0.32), IGFBP2 (&#43;0.31) and DSG2 (&#43;0.30); all groups except the vegans had lower HAVCR1 (-0.38 in vegetarians). The observed differences were generally similar in direction in both ethnicities.

DiscussionIn this first comprehensive assessment of plasma proteins by diet group, we identified many differences in proteins between groups defined by animal food consumption; this variation in protein levels suggests differences in various biological activities, including gastrointestinal tract and kidney function, which may relate to differences in future disease risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nutrition is a key contributor to health. Recently, several studies have identified associations between factors such as microbiota composition and health-related responses to dietary intake, raising the potential of personalized nutritional recommendations. To further our understanding of personalized nutrition, detailed individual data must be collected from participants in their day-to-day lives. However, this is challenging in conventional studies that require clinical measurements and site visits. So-called digital or remote cohorts allow in situ data collection on a daily basis through mobile applications, online services, and wearable sensors, but they raise questions about study retention and data quality. &#34;Food &amp; You&#34; is a personalized nutrition study implemented as a fully digital cohort in which participants track food intake, physical activity, gut microbiota, glycemia, and other data for two to four weeks. Here, we describe the study protocol, report on study completion rates, and describe the collected data, focusing on assessing their quality and reliability. Overall, the study collected data from over 1000 participants, including high-resolution data of nutritional intake of more than 46 million kcal collected from 315,126 dishes over 23,335 participant days, 1,470,030 blood glucose measurements, 49,110 survey responses, and 867 stool samples for gut microbiota analysis. Retention was high, with over 60% of the enrolled participants completing the study. Various data quality assessment efforts suggest the captured high-resolution nutritional data accurately reflect individual diet patterns, paving the way for digital cohorts as a typical study design for personalized nutrition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: A systematic approach to collect, peruse and summarise the available information relating to the potential benefits of consuming dietary microbes was pursued in this scoping review. This review focused on the research endpoints, experimental designs, and microbial exposure in experimental as well as observational research work. Approach: Using a structured-set of keywords, scientific databases were systematically searched to retrieve publications reporting outcomes pertaining to the use of dietary-microbes in healthy, non-patient populations. Searches were further tailored to focus on eight different health categories, namely, antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD), gastrointestinal health (GIH), immunological health (ImH), cardiovascular health and metabolic syndrome (CvHMS), cancer prevention (CanPr), respiratory health (ReH), weight management (WtMgt), and urogenital health (UrGH). Quality of evidence available in each publication was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. Result: The search yielded 228 relevant publications describing 282 experimental cases comprising 62 research endpoints overall. A microbial dose of 2x109 CFU/day was associated with non-negative reported outcomes. Older population groups with a median age of 39 years were associated with positive outcomes. Conclusion: More high-quality research is required investigating the role of dietary microbes in maintaining general health, particularly in the health categories of urogenital health, weight management and cancer prevention.</p>
