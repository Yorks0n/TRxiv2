People who lose their sense of smell self-report consuming more salt to compensate for a lack of flavor and enhance eating enjoyment. However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied.">

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 {+/-} 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.\nEvidence for protein leverage on Total Energy Intake, but not Body Mass Index, in a large cohort of older adults\nAuthors: Honfo, S. H.; Senior, A.; Legault, V.; Presse, N.; Turcot, V.; Gaudreau, P.; Simpson, S.; Raubenheimer, D.; Cohen, A. A.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291391\nBACKGROUNDProtein leverage (PL), the phenomenon of food consuming until absolute intake of protein meets a target value, regardless of shortfall or overconsuming for other nutrients in the diet and total energy intake (TEI). Evidence for PL was observed in humans, recently in a cohort of youth with obesity. This study aimed to test for PL and the protein leverage hypothesis (PLH) in a cohort of older adults. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective analysis of dietary intake in a cohort of 1699 community-dwelling older adults aged 67-84 years from the NuAge cohort. We computed TEI and the energy contribution (EC) from each macronutrient. The strength of leverage of macronutrients was assessed through power functions (TEI = {micro} * ECL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and mixture models were fitted to predict TEI and BMI from macronutrient ECs. RESULTSThe mean TEI was 7,673 kJ and macronutrient ECs were 50.4 %, 33.2 % and 16.4 %, respectively for carbohydrates, fat, and protein. High carbohydrate intake was associated with low fat intake. There was a strong negative association (L = -0.37; p \u003c 0.001) between the protein EC and TEI. Each percent of energy intake from protein reduced TEI by 77 kJ on average, ceteris paribus. BMI was unassociated with TEI in this cohort, so the PLH could not be tested here. CONCLUSIONSFindings indicate clear evidence for PL on TEI, but not on BMI, likely because TEI and BMI become increasingly uncoupled during aging.\nA prebiotic diet changes neural correlates of food decision- making in overweight adults: a randomized controlled within-subject cross-over trial\nAuthors: Medawar, E.; Beyer, F.; Thieleking, R.; Haange, S.-B.; Rolle-Kampczyk, U.; Reinicke, M.; Chakaroun, R.; von Bergen, M.; Stumvoll, M.; Villringer, A.; Witte, V.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-06-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.23290707\nObjectiveAnimal studies suggest that prebiotic, plant-derived nutrients could improve homeostatic and hedonic brain functions through improvements in microbiome-gut-brain communication. However, little is known if these results are applicable to humans. Therefore, we tested the effects of high-dosed prebiotic fiber on reward-related food decision-making in a randomized controlled within-subject cross-over study and assayed potential microbial and metabolic markers. Design59 overweight young adults (19 females, 18-42 years, body mass index 25-30 kg/m2) underwent functional task MRI before and after 14 days of supplementary intake of 30 g/d of inulin (prebiotics) and equicaloric placebo, respectively. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gastrointestinal hormones, glucose/lipid and inflammatory markers were assayed in fasting blood. Gut microbiota and SCFA were measured in stool. ResultsCompared to placebo, participants showed decreased brain activation towards high-caloric wanted food stimuli in the ventral tegmental area and right orbitofrontal cortex after prebiotics (pre-registered, pFWE \u003c 0.05). While fasting blood levels remained largely unchanged, 16S-rRNA sequencing showed significant shifts in the microbiome towards increased occurrence of, among others, SCFA-producing Bifidobacteriacea, and changes in \u003e90 predicted functional signaling pathways after prebiotic intake. Changes in brain activation correlated with changes in Actinobacteria microbial abundance and associated activity linked with SCFA production, such as ABC transporter metabolism. ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, a prebiotic intervention attenuated reward-related brain activation during food-decision making, paralleled by shifts in gut microbiota indicative of higher SCFA production.\nMaternal B-vitamin and vitamin D status before, during and after pregnancy, and the influence of supplementation preconception and during pregnancy: NiPPeR double-blind randomized controlled trial\nAuthors: Godfrey, K. M.; Titcombe, P.; El-Heis, S.; Albert, B. B.; Tham, E. H.; Barton, S. J.; Kenealy, T.; Chong, M. F.-F.; Nield, H.; Chong, Y. S.; Chan, S.-Y.; Cutfield, W.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291584\nBackgroundMaternal vitamin status preconception and during pregnancy have important consequences for pregnancy outcome and offspring development. Changes in status from preconception to early and late pregnancy and postpartum have been inferred from cross-sectional data, with lower pregnancy concentrations often ascribed to plasma volume expansion, but without truly longitudinal data from preconception through pregnancy and post-delivery, and sparse data on the influence of supplementation. This study characterized longitudinal patterns of maternal vitamin status from preconception, through early and late pregnancy, to 6-months post-delivery, and determined the influence of supplementation. Methods and FindingsBetween 2015-2017, 1729 UK, Singapore and New Zealand women aged 18-38 years planning conception were recruited from the community to a double-blind controlled trial and randomized to a standard (control) or an intervention supplement preconception and throughout pregnancy. Vitamins common to both supplements were folic acid and {beta}-carotene, with the intervention additionally including riboflavin, vitamins B6, B12 and D in amounts available in over-the-counter supplements, alongside iron, calcium and iodine (control and intervention) and myo-inositol, probiotics and zinc (intervention only). We measured maternal plasma concentrations of B-vitamins, vitamin D and insufficiency/deficiency markers (homocysteine, hydroxykynurenine-ratio, methylmalonic acid), at recruitment and 1-month after commencing intervention preconception, in early and late pregnancy, and post-delivery (6-months after supplement discontinuation). From all timepoint data, we derived standard deviation scores (SDS) to characterize longitudinal changes in controls and differences between control and intervention participants. At recruitment preconception, significant proportions had marginal or low plasma status for folate (29.2% \u003c13.6 nmol/L), riboflavin (7.5% \u003c5 nmol/L, 82.0% [\u0026le;]26.5 nmol/L), vitamin B12 (9.1% \u003c221 pmol/L) and vitamin D (48.7% \u003c50 nmol/L). Among controls, plasma concentrations showed differing longitudinal patterns from preconception; riboflavin fell through early/late pregnancy, 25-hydroxyvitamin D was unchanged in early pregnancy, and vitamin B6 and B12 concentrations declined through pregnancy, becoming \u003e1 SDS lower than baseline by 28 weeks gestation, with 54.2% developing a low late pregnancy vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5-phosphate \u003c20 nmol/L). Preconception, the control/intervention groups had similar baseline vitamin concentrations; 1-month after supplement commencement, plasma concentrations became substantially higher in intervention participants; riboflavin by 0.77 SDS (95%CI 0.68-0.87), vitamin B6 1.07 (0.99-1.14), vitamin B12 0.55 (0.46-0.64) and vitamin D 0.51 (0.43-0.60), with the higher levels maintained during pregnancy and marked reduction in insufficiency/deficiency markers (lower homocysteine, hydroxykynurenine-ratio, methylmalonic acid) and the late pregnancy prevalence of vitamin D \u003c50 nmol/L reduced from 35.1% to 8.5%. Plasma vitamin B12 was still higher in the intervention group 6-months post-delivery. ConclusionSignificant proportions of preconception women have marginal or low status of folate, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and vitamin D, and many develop markers of vitamin B6 deficiency in late pregnancy. In the absence of supplementation, maternal plasma vitamin concentrations show differing longitudinal patterns from preconception to early and late pregnancy, suggesting plasma volume expansion does not wholly account for lower gestational concentrations. Preconception/pregnancy supplementation in amounts available in over-the-counter supplements substantially reduces the prevalence of deficiency/depletion markers before and during pregnancy, and a higher maternal plasma vitamin B12 was maintained during the recommended lactational period.\nImprecision nutrition? Duplicate meals result in unreliable individual glycemic responses measured by continuous glucose monitors across three dietary patterns in adults without diabetes\nAuthors: Hengist, A.; Guo, J.; Hall, K. D.\nScore: 145.6, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291406\nBackgroundContinuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are being used to characterize postprandial glycemic responses and thereby provide personalized dietary advice to minimize glycemic excursions. However, the efficacy of such advice depends on reliable CGM responses. ObjectiveTo explore within-subject variability of CGM responses to duplicate meals in an inpatient setting. MethodsCGM data were collected in two controlled feeding studies (NCT03407053 and NCT03878108) in 30 participants without diabetes capturing 948 meal responses in duplicate [~]1 week apart from three dietary patterns. One study used two different CGMs (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro and Dexcom G4 Platinum) whereas the other study used only Dexcom. We calculated the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for each 2-h post-meal period and compared within-subject iAUCs using the same CGM for the duplicate meals using linear correlations, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman analyses, and compared individual variability of glycemic responses to duplicate meals versus different meals using standard deviations (SDs). ResultsThere were weak to moderate positive linear correlations between within-subject iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott r=0.47, p\u003c0.0001, Dexcom r=0.40, p\u003c0.0001), with low within-participant reliability indicated by ICC (Abbott 0.31, Dexcom 0.16). Bland-Altman analyses indicated wide limits of agreement (Abbott -31.4 to 31.5 mg/dL, Dexcom -32.3 to 31.6 mg/dL) but no significant bias of mean iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott 0.1 mg/dL, Dexcom -0.3 mg/dL). Individual variability of glycemic responses to duplicate meals was similar to that of different meals evaluated each diet week for both Abbott (SDduplicate = 10.7 mg/dL, SDweek 1 =12.4 mg/dL, SDweek 2 =11.6 mg/dL, p=0.38) and Dexcom (SDduplicate = 11.8 mg/dL, SDweek 1 =12.2 mg/dL, SDweek 2 =12.4 mg/dL, p=0.80). ConclusionsIndividual postprandial CGM responses to duplicate meals were unreliable in adults without diabetes. Personalized diet advice based on CGM measurements in adults without diabetes requires more reliable methods involving aggregated repeated measurements. This secondary analysis contains data from two trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov(NCT03407053 and NCT03878108).\nModifying gut integrity and microbiome in children with severe acute malnutrition using legume-based feeds (MIMBLE II): A Phase II trial\nAuthors: Walsh, K.; Kiosa, A.; Olupot-Olupot, P.; Okiror, W.; Ssenyond, T.; Okalebo, C. B.; Muhindo, R.; Mpoya, A.; George, E. C.; Frost, G.; Maitland, K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.29.23290673\nBackgroundChildren hospitalised with severe malnutrition (SM) have high mortality and relapse/readmission rates. Current milk-based formulations targets restoring ponderal growth but not modification of gut barrier integrety or microbiome which increase risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes. ObjectivesWe propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes. MethodsWe conducted at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda an open-label Phase II trial involving 160 Ugandan children with SM (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) \u003c11.5cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n=80) versus WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n=80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to Day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (\u003e5 g/kg/day), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution. FindingsIncrease in Day 90 MUAC was similar in LF and WHO arms (1.1 cm (interquatile range.IQR 1.1) vs 1.4cm (IQR 1.40) p=0.09. Day 90 mortality was similar 11/80 (13.8%) vs 12/80 (15%) respectively OR 0.91 (0.40 -2.07) p=0.83. There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the legume feed 10 children switched to WHO feeds. Per protocol analysis indicated a non-significant trend to lower Day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the legume feed (6/60: (10%) and (2/60: 3%) vs WHO feeds (12/71: 17.5%) and (4/71: 6%) respectively. ConclusionFurther refinement of legume feeds and clinical trials are warrented given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition. Trial registrationISRCTN 10309022.

        <p class="abstract">People who lose their sense of smell self-report consuming more salt to compensate for a lack of flavor and enhance eating enjoyment. However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 {&#43;/-} 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDProtein leverage (PL), the phenomenon of food consuming until absolute intake of protein meets a target value, regardless of shortfall or overconsuming for other nutrients in the diet and total energy intake (TEI). Evidence for PL was observed in humans, recently in a cohort of youth with obesity. This study aimed to test for PL and the protein leverage hypothesis (PLH) in a cohort of older adults.

METHODSWe conducted a retrospective analysis of dietary intake in a cohort of 1699 community-dwelling older adults aged 67-84 years from the NuAge cohort. We computed TEI and the energy contribution (EC) from each macronutrient. The strength of leverage of macronutrients was assessed through power functions (TEI = {micro} * ECL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and mixture models were fitted to predict TEI and BMI from macronutrient ECs.

RESULTSThe mean TEI was 7,673 kJ and macronutrient ECs were 50.4 %, 33.2 % and 16.4 %, respectively for carbohydrates, fat, and protein. High carbohydrate intake was associated with low fat intake. There was a strong negative association (L = -0.37; p &lt; 0.001) between the protein EC and TEI. Each percent of energy intake from protein reduced TEI by 77 kJ on average, ceteris paribus. BMI was unassociated with TEI in this cohort, so the PLH could not be tested here.

CONCLUSIONSFindings indicate clear evidence for PL on TEI, but not on BMI, likely because TEI and BMI become increasingly uncoupled during aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveAnimal studies suggest that prebiotic, plant-derived nutrients could improve homeostatic and hedonic brain functions through improvements in microbiome-gut-brain communication. However, little is known if these results are applicable to humans. Therefore, we tested the effects of high-dosed prebiotic fiber on reward-related food decision-making in a randomized controlled within-subject cross-over study and assayed potential microbial and metabolic markers.

Design59 overweight young adults (19 females, 18-42 years, body mass index 25-30 kg/m2) underwent functional task MRI before and after 14 days of supplementary intake of 30 g/d of inulin (prebiotics) and equicaloric placebo, respectively. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gastrointestinal hormones, glucose/lipid and inflammatory markers were assayed in fasting blood. Gut microbiota and SCFA were measured in stool.

ResultsCompared to placebo, participants showed decreased brain activation towards high-caloric wanted food stimuli in the ventral tegmental area and right orbitofrontal cortex after prebiotics (pre-registered, pFWE &lt; 0.05). While fasting blood levels remained largely unchanged, 16S-rRNA sequencing showed significant shifts in the microbiome towards increased occurrence of, among others, SCFA-producing Bifidobacteriacea, and changes in &gt;90 predicted functional signaling pathways after prebiotic intake. Changes in brain activation correlated with changes in Actinobacteria microbial abundance and associated activity linked with SCFA production, such as ABC transporter metabolism.

ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, a prebiotic intervention attenuated reward-related brain activation during food-decision making, paralleled by shifts in gut microbiota indicative of higher SCFA production.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMaternal vitamin status preconception and during pregnancy have important consequences for pregnancy outcome and offspring development. Changes in status from preconception to early and late pregnancy and postpartum have been inferred from cross-sectional data, with lower pregnancy concentrations often ascribed to plasma volume expansion, but without truly longitudinal data from preconception through pregnancy and post-delivery, and sparse data on the influence of supplementation. This study characterized longitudinal patterns of maternal vitamin status from preconception, through early and late pregnancy, to 6-months post-delivery, and determined the influence of supplementation.

Methods and FindingsBetween 2015-2017, 1729 UK, Singapore and New Zealand women aged 18-38 years planning conception were recruited from the community to a double-blind controlled trial and randomized to a standard (control) or an intervention supplement preconception and throughout pregnancy. Vitamins common to both supplements were folic acid and {beta}-carotene, with the intervention additionally including riboflavin, vitamins B6, B12 and D in amounts available in over-the-counter supplements, alongside iron, calcium and iodine (control and intervention) and myo-inositol, probiotics and zinc (intervention only).

We measured maternal plasma concentrations of B-vitamins, vitamin D and insufficiency/deficiency markers (homocysteine, hydroxykynurenine-ratio, methylmalonic acid), at recruitment and 1-month after commencing intervention preconception, in early and late pregnancy, and post-delivery (6-months after supplement discontinuation). From all timepoint data, we derived standard deviation scores (SDS) to characterize longitudinal changes in controls and differences between control and intervention participants. At recruitment preconception, significant proportions had marginal or low plasma status for folate (29.2% &lt;13.6 nmol/L), riboflavin (7.5% &lt;5 nmol/L, 82.0% [&amp;le;]26.5 nmol/L), vitamin B12 (9.1% &lt;221 pmol/L) and vitamin D (48.7% &lt;50 nmol/L). Among controls, plasma concentrations showed differing longitudinal patterns from preconception; riboflavin fell through early/late pregnancy, 25-hydroxyvitamin D was unchanged in early pregnancy, and vitamin B6 and B12 concentrations declined through pregnancy, becoming &gt;1 SDS lower than baseline by 28 weeks gestation, with 54.2% developing a low late pregnancy vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5-phosphate &lt;20 nmol/L). Preconception, the control/intervention groups had similar baseline vitamin concentrations; 1-month after supplement commencement, plasma concentrations became substantially higher in intervention participants; riboflavin by 0.77 SDS (95%CI 0.68-0.87), vitamin B6 1.07 (0.99-1.14), vitamin B12 0.55 (0.46-0.64) and vitamin D 0.51 (0.43-0.60), with the higher levels maintained during pregnancy and marked reduction in insufficiency/deficiency markers (lower homocysteine, hydroxykynurenine-ratio, methylmalonic acid) and the late pregnancy prevalence of vitamin D &lt;50 nmol/L reduced from 35.1% to 8.5%. Plasma vitamin B12 was still higher in the intervention group 6-months post-delivery.

ConclusionSignificant proportions of preconception women have marginal or low status of folate, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and vitamin D, and many develop markers of vitamin B6 deficiency in late pregnancy. In the absence of supplementation, maternal plasma vitamin concentrations show differing longitudinal patterns from preconception to early and late pregnancy, suggesting plasma volume expansion does not wholly account for lower gestational concentrations. Preconception/pregnancy supplementation in amounts available in over-the-counter supplements substantially reduces the prevalence of deficiency/depletion markers before and during pregnancy, and a higher maternal plasma vitamin B12 was maintained during the recommended lactational period.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundContinuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are being used to characterize postprandial glycemic responses and thereby provide personalized dietary advice to minimize glycemic excursions. However, the efficacy of such advice depends on reliable CGM responses.

ObjectiveTo explore within-subject variability of CGM responses to duplicate meals in an inpatient setting.

MethodsCGM data were collected in two controlled feeding studies (NCT03407053 and NCT03878108) in 30 participants without diabetes capturing 948 meal responses in duplicate [~]1 week apart from three dietary patterns. One study used two different CGMs (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro and Dexcom G4 Platinum) whereas the other study used only Dexcom. We calculated the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for each 2-h post-meal period and compared within-subject iAUCs using the same CGM for the duplicate meals using linear correlations, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman analyses, and compared individual variability of glycemic responses to duplicate meals versus different meals using standard deviations (SDs).

ResultsThere were weak to moderate positive linear correlations between within-subject iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott r=0.47, p&lt;0.0001, Dexcom r=0.40, p&lt;0.0001), with low within-participant reliability indicated by ICC (Abbott 0.31, Dexcom 0.16). Bland-Altman analyses indicated wide limits of agreement (Abbott -31.4 to 31.5 mg/dL, Dexcom -32.3 to 31.6 mg/dL) but no significant bias of mean iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott 0.1 mg/dL, Dexcom -0.3 mg/dL). Individual variability of glycemic responses to duplicate meals was similar to that of different meals evaluated each diet week for both Abbott (SDduplicate = 10.7 mg/dL, SDweek 1 =12.4 mg/dL, SDweek 2 =11.6 mg/dL, p=0.38) and Dexcom (SDduplicate = 11.8 mg/dL, SDweek 1 =12.2 mg/dL, SDweek 2 =12.4 mg/dL, p=0.80).

ConclusionsIndividual postprandial CGM responses to duplicate meals were unreliable in adults without diabetes. Personalized diet advice based on CGM measurements in adults without diabetes requires more reliable methods involving aggregated repeated measurements.

This secondary analysis contains data from two trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov(NCT03407053 and NCT03878108).</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChildren hospitalised with severe malnutrition (SM) have high mortality and relapse/readmission rates. Current milk-based formulations targets restoring ponderal growth but not modification of gut barrier integrety or microbiome which increase risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes.

ObjectivesWe propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes.

MethodsWe conducted at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda an open-label Phase II trial involving 160 Ugandan children with SM (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;11.5cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n=80) versus WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n=80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to Day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (&gt;5 g/kg/day), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution.

FindingsIncrease in Day 90 MUAC was similar in LF and WHO arms (1.1 cm (interquatile range.IQR 1.1) vs 1.4cm (IQR 1.40) p=0.09. Day 90 mortality was similar 11/80 (13.8%) vs 12/80 (15%) respectively OR 0.91 (0.40 -2.07) p=0.83. There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the legume feed 10 children switched to WHO feeds. Per protocol analysis indicated a non-significant trend to lower Day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the legume feed (6/60: (10%) and (2/60: 3%) vs WHO feeds (12/71: 17.5%) and (4/71: 6%) respectively.

ConclusionFurther refinement of legume feeds and clinical trials are warrented given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition.
