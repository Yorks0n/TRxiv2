While lifestyle modifications, medications, and social factors are recognized influencers of the aging process, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms necessitates an in-depth exploration of the epigenetic landscape. Notably, the specific epigenetic clock and predictor effects of a vegan diet, compared to an omnivorous counterpart, remain inadequately explored, despite indications of potential impacts on aging-related outcomes. This study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the impact of an eight-week entirely plant-based or healthy omnivorous diet on blood DNA methylation in paired twins. Results show distinct responses, with the vegan cohort solely exhibiting significant decreases in overall epigenetic age acceleration (PC GrimAge, PC PhenoAge, DunedinPACE), including among specific systems (Inflammation, Heart, Hormone, Liver, and Metabolic), aligning with anti-aging effects of plant-based diets. Analyses of methylation surrogates of clinical, metabolite, and protein markers indicate diet-specific shifts, while exemplifying DNA methylation markers in predicting complex traits influenced by diet. Comprehensive epigenome-wide analysis unveils diet-specific differentially methylated loci, offering insights into influenced pathways. This study sheds light on the advantageous aging benefits of a healthy vegan diet, while providing a foundation for future personalized interventions using epigenetic age clocks in promoting overall well-being.\nAtherogenic sdLDL-cholesterol and resistin association with vitamin B12 in relation to Body Mass Index\nAuthors: Ashfaq, F.; Haji Alhaji, J.; Alharbi, M. S.; Khatoon, F.; Alhatlani, N. H. E.; Mari Alkhamisi, F. A.; Alshuwaier, G. O.; Khan, M. I.; Beg, M. M. A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.24300967\nIntroductionObesity is a known risk factor for many chronic diseases and is a growing global health concern and poor health outcomes have consistently been linked to body mass index (BMI). Small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) changes brought on by obesity may increase the likelihood of endothelium penetration and subsequent atherogenesis. Numerous tissues metabolic and secretory functions are altered by obesity, which may also increase the serum resistin level. MethodsPresent study included 300 participants with diffent BMI among them sdLDL and resistin was evaluated. HbA1c was analysed by whole blood of EDTA and the serum were thawed sample was used for lipid parameters (TG, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL and sdLDL) and vitamin B12 analysis as well as resistin level was analysed by ELISA. ResultsStudy observed higher HbA1c (%, p=0.0004), LDL (mg/dl) (\u003c0.0001), TG (mg/dl) (\u003c0.0001), Cholesterol (mg/dl) (\u003c0.0001), VLDL (mg/dl) (\u003c0.0001) in obese compared to overweight, normal BMI, except HDL. Smokers and hypertensive participants had higher sdLDL (p=0.03, p=0.0001) and resistin level (p=0.03, p\u003c0.0001). Obese participants had high amount of sdLDL (p\u003c0.0001, p\u003c0.0001) and resistin level (p\u003c0.0001, p\u003c0.0001) compared to overweight and normal BMI. SdLDL and resistin were found to be positively correlated as well as correlation analysis of sdLDL and resistin level was observed to be significantly correlated with BMI, systolic, TG, cholesterol, VLDL, LDL while negative correlation with HDL level. ROC analysis showed that sdLDL and resistin could be used as prognostic factor for overweight/obesity at cutoff value of 18.55 mg/dl (sdLDL) and 750 pg/ml (resistin). It was also observed that the participant with normal BMI had 389.6 pmol/L while overweight participant had 300.6 pmol/L (p\u003c0.0001) and obese had 291.0 pmol/L (p\u003c0.0001). ConclusionStudy concluded that the obese participants had higher TG, cholesterol, VLDL, LDL and lower HDL level. The most importantly, higher sdLDL level and resistin level was observed in obese participants as well as higher sdLDL and resistin could influence the higher lipid parameters (TG, cholesterol, VLDL, LDL) and lower HDL level. It was also observed that obese participants had lower vitamin B12 level and could lead to other metabolic error.\n",
