Gut-derived hormones affect appetite and are thought to play an important role in body weight regulation. Dietary macronutrient composition can influence gut-derived appetite hormone concentrations, thereby providing theoretical basis for why some diets might facilitate weight loss better than others. We investigated postprandial gut-derived appetite hormones in 20 inpatient adults after 2 weeks of eating either a low carbohydrate (LC) or a low fat (LF) diet followed by the alternate diet in random order.">

Dietary macronutrient composition can influence gut-derived appetite hormone concentrations, thereby providing theoretical basis for why some diets might facilitate weight loss better than others. We investigated postprandial gut-derived appetite hormones in 20 inpatient adults after 2 weeks of eating either a low carbohydrate (LC) or a low fat (LF) diet followed by the alternate diet in random order. A LC meal resulted in significantly greater postprandial GLP-1, GIP, and PYY but lower ghrelin compared to an isocaloric LF meal (allp\u003c0.02). However, differences in gut-derived appetite hormones were incommensurate with subsequent ad libitum energy intake over the rest of the day, which was 551{+/-}103 kcal (p\u003c0.0001) greater with the LC as compared to the LF diet. The effects of gut-derived appetite hormones on ad libitum energy intake can be dominated by other diet-related factors, at least in the short-term.\nDiet order affects energy balance in randomized crossover feeding studies that vary in macronutrients but not ultra-processing\nAuthors: Sciarrillo, C.

OBJECTIVETo explore diet order effects on energy balance and food intake between randomized diet order groups in two inpatient crossover studies originally designed to compare within-subject differences in ad libitum energy intake between either minimally processed low carbohydrate (LC) versus low fat (LF) diets or macronutrient-matched diets composed of mostly minimally processed food (MPF) or ultra-processed food (UPF). METHODSDiet order group comparisons of changes in body weight, body composition, and differences in energy expenditure, and food intake were assessed over four weeks in 20 adults randomized to either the LC followed immediately by the LF diet (LC[-\u0026gt;]LF) or the opposite order (LF[-\u0026gt;]LC) as well as 20 adults randomized to either the MPF followed by UPF (MPF[-\u0026gt;]UPF) diets or the opposite order (UPF[-\u0026gt;]MPF). RESULTSSubjects randomized to LC[-\u0026gt;]LF lost 2.9 {+/-} 1.1 kg more body weight (p \u003c 0.001) and 1.5 {+/-} 0.6 kg more body fat (p = 0.03) than the LF[-\u0026gt;]LC group likely because the LC[-\u0026gt;]LF group consumed 922 {+/-} 304 kcal/d less than the LFaLC group (p = 0.0024). Reduced energy intake in LC[-\u0026gt;]LF vs LFaLC was driven by the last two weeks (-1610 {+/-} 306 kcal/d; p\u003c0.00001) perhaps due to carryover effects of gut adaptations over the first two weeks arising from large differences in the mass of food (1295 {+/-} 209 g/d; p\u003c0.00001) and fiber intake (58 {+/-} 5 g/d; p\u003c0.00001). There were no diet order effects on ad libitum energy intake, body weight, or body composition change between UPF[-\u0026gt;]MPF versus MPF[-\u0026gt;]UPF groups.
