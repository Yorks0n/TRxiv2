J.; Travis, R. C.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294084\nBackground and objectivesCirculating proteins are integral to many biological processes. We aimed to assess differences in the plasma proteome between people of different dietary groups defined by degree of animal food consumption. MethodsThe UK Biobank recruited middle-aged adults (mostly 40 to 69 years) throughout the UK between 2006-2010. Relative concentrations of 1463 plasma proteins were quantified using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay on blood samples from 49,326 participants, who were also asked to report their ethnicity and consumption of red and processed meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs. We defined six diet groups among the white British participants (23,116 regular meat eaters, 23,323 low meat eaters, 484 poultry eaters, 1074 fish eaters, 722 vegetarians, and 54 vegans), and two diet groups among the British Indians (390 meat eaters and 163 vegetarians). We used multivariable-adjusted linear regressions to assess differences in protein concentrations between diet groups, with correction for multiple testing. ResultsWe observed significant differences in many plasma proteins by diet group (683 proteins in white British participants, 1 in British Indians), in particular many proteins that are majority expressed in the digestive system. Of the biggest differences, compared with regular meat eaters, the non-meat eaters had significantly higher FGF21 (e.g. +0.40 SD in vegetarians), GUCA2A (+0.33), FOLR1 (+0.32), IGFBP2 (+0.31) and DSG2 (+0.30); all groups except the vegans had lower HAVCR1 (-0.38 in vegetarians). The observed differences were generally similar in direction in both ethnicities. DiscussionIn this first comprehensive assessment of plasma proteins by diet group, we identified many differences in proteins between groups defined by animal food consumption; this variation in protein levels suggests differences in various biological activities, including gastrointestinal tract and kidney function, which may relate to differences in future disease risk.\nBioactive glycans in a microbiome-directed food for malnourished children\nAuthors: Hibberd, M.

I.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23293998\nEvidence is accumulating that perturbed postnatal development of the gut microbiome contributes to childhood malnutrition1-4. Designing effective microbiome-directed therapeutic foods to repair these perturbations requires knowledge about how food components interact with the microbiome to alter its expressed functions. Here we use biospecimens from a randomized, controlled trial of a microbiome-directed complementary food prototype (MDCF-2) that produced superior rates of weight gain compared to a conventional ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) in 12-18-month-old Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)4. We reconstructed 1000 bacterial genomes (metagenome-assembled genomes, MAGs) present in their fecal microbiomes, identified 75 whose abundances were positively associated with weight gain (change in weight-for-length Z score, WLZ), characterized gene expression changes in these MAGs as a function of treatment type and WLZ response, and used mass spectrometry to quantify carbohydrate structures in MDCF-2 and feces. The results reveal treatment-induced changes in expression of carbohydrate metabolic pathways in WLZ-associated MAGs. Comparing participants consuming MDCF-2 versus RUSF, and MDCF-2-treated children in the upper versus lower quartiles of WLZ responses revealed that two Prevotella copri MAGs positively associated with WLZ were principal contributors to MDCF-2-induced expression of metabolic pathways involved in utilization of its component glycans. Moreover, the predicted specificities of carbohydrate active enzymes expressed by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in these two MAGs correlate with the (i) in vitro growth of Bangladeshi P. copri strains, possessing differing degrees of PUL and overall genomic content similarity to these MAGs, cultured in defined medium containing different purified glycans representative of those in MDCF-2, and (ii) levels of carbohydrate structures identified in feces from clinical trial participants. In the accompanying paper5, we use a gnotobiotic mouse model colonized with age- and WLZ-associated bacterial taxa cultured from this study population, and fed diets resembling those consumed by study participants, to directly test the relationship between P. copri, MDCF-2 glycan metabolism, host ponderal growth responses, and intestinal gene expression and metabolism. The ability to identify bioactive glycan structures in MDCFs that are metabolized by growth-associated bacterial taxa will help guide recommendations about use of this MDCF for children with acute malnutrition representing different geographic locales and ages, as well as enable development of bioequivalent, or more efficacious, formulations composed of culturally acceptable and affordable ingredients.\n",
