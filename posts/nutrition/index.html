However, little is known if these results are applicable to humans. Therefore, we tested the effects of high-dosed prebiotic fiber on reward-related food decision-making in a randomized controlled within-subject cross-over study and assayed potential microbial and metabolic markers. Design59 overweight young adults (19 females, 18-42 years, body mass index 25-30 kg/m2) underwent functional task MRI before and after 14 days of supplementary intake of 30 g/d of inulin (prebiotics) and equicaloric placebo, respectively. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), gastrointestinal hormones, glucose/lipid and inflammatory markers were assayed in fasting blood. Gut microbiota and SCFA were measured in stool. ResultsCompared to placebo, participants showed decreased brain activation towards high-caloric wanted food stimuli in the ventral tegmental area and right orbitofrontal cortex after prebiotics (pre-registered, pFWE \u003c 0.05). While fasting blood levels remained largely unchanged, 16S-rRNA sequencing showed significant shifts in the microbiome towards increased occurrence of, among others, SCFA-producing Bifidobacteriacea, and changes in \u003e90 predicted functional signaling pathways after prebiotic intake. Changes in brain activation correlated with changes in Actinobacteria microbial abundance and associated activity linked with SCFA production, such as ABC transporter metabolism. ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, a prebiotic intervention attenuated reward-related brain activation during food-decision making, paralleled by shifts in gut microbiota indicative of higher SCFA production.\nMore spice, less salt: how capsaicin affects liking for and perceived saltiness of foods in people with smell loss.\nAuthors: Hunter, S.; Beatty, C.; Dalton, P. H.\nScore: 40.1, Published: 2023-06-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.05.23290966\nPeople who lose their sense of smell self-report consuming more salt to compensate for a lack of flavor and enhance eating enjoyment. However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 {+/-} 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.\nEvidence for protein leverage on Total Energy Intake, but not Body Mass Index, in a large cohort of older adults\nAuthors: Honfo, S. H.; Senior, A.; Legault, V.; Presse, N.; Turcot, V.; Gaudreau, P.; Simpson, S.; Raubenheimer, D.; Cohen, A. A.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291391\nBACKGROUNDProtein leverage (PL), the phenomenon of food consuming until absolute intake of protein meets a target value, regardless of shortfall or overconsuming for other nutrients in the diet and total energy intake (TEI). Evidence for PL was observed in humans, recently in a cohort of youth with obesity. This study aimed to test for PL and the protein leverage hypothesis (PLH) in a cohort of older adults. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective analysis of dietary intake in a cohort of 1699 community-dwelling older adults aged 67-84 years from the NuAge cohort. We computed TEI and the energy contribution (EC) from each macronutrient. The strength of leverage of macronutrients was assessed through power functions (TEI = {micro} * ECL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and mixture models were fitted to predict TEI and BMI from macronutrient ECs. RESULTSThe mean TEI was 7,673 kJ and macronutrient ECs were 50.4 %, 33.2 % and 16.4 %, respectively for carbohydrates, fat, and protein. High carbohydrate intake was associated with low fat intake. There was a strong negative association (L = -0.37; p \u003c 0.001) between the protein EC and TEI. Each percent of energy intake from protein reduced TEI by 77 kJ on average, ceteris paribus. BMI was unassociated with TEI in this cohort, so the PLH could not be tested here. CONCLUSIONSFindings indicate clear evidence for PL on TEI, but not on BMI, likely because TEI and BMI become increasingly uncoupled during aging.\nModifying gut integrity and microbiome in children with severe acute malnutrition using legume-based feeds (MIMBLE II): A Phase II trial\nAuthors: Walsh, K.; Kiosa, A.; Olupot-Olupot, P.; Okiror, W.; Ssenyond, T.; Okalebo, C. B.; Muhindo, R.; Mpoya, A.; George, E. C.; Frost, G.; Maitland, K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.29.23290673\nBackgroundChildren hospitalised with severe malnutrition (SM) have high mortality and relapse/readmission rates. Current milk-based formulations targets restoring ponderal growth but not modification of gut barrier integrety or microbiome which increase risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes. ObjectivesWe propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes. MethodsWe conducted at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda an open-label Phase II trial involving 160 Ugandan children with SM (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) \u003c11.5cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n=80) versus WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n=80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to Day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (\u003e5 g/kg/day), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution. FindingsIncrease in Day 90 MUAC was similar in LF and WHO arms (1.1 cm (interquatile range.IQR 1.1) vs 1.4cm (IQR 1.40) p=0.09. Day 90 mortality was similar 11/80 (13.8%) vs 12/80 (15%) respectively OR 0.91 (0.40 -2.07) p=0.83. There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the legume feed 10 children switched to WHO feeds. Per protocol analysis indicated a non-significant trend to lower Day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the legume feed (6/60: (10%) and (2/60: 3%) vs WHO feeds (12/71: 17.5%) and (4/71: 6%) respectively. ConclusionFurther refinement of legume feeds and clinical trials are warrented given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition. Trial registrationISRCTN 10309022.

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 {&#43;/-} 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDProtein leverage (PL), the phenomenon of food consuming until absolute intake of protein meets a target value, regardless of shortfall or overconsuming for other nutrients in the diet and total energy intake (TEI). Evidence for PL was observed in humans, recently in a cohort of youth with obesity. This study aimed to test for PL and the protein leverage hypothesis (PLH) in a cohort of older adults.

METHODSWe conducted a retrospective analysis of dietary intake in a cohort of 1699 community-dwelling older adults aged 67-84 years from the NuAge cohort. We computed TEI and the energy contribution (EC) from each macronutrient. The strength of leverage of macronutrients was assessed through power functions (TEI = {micro} * ECL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated, and mixture models were fitted to predict TEI and BMI from macronutrient ECs.

RESULTSThe mean TEI was 7,673 kJ and macronutrient ECs were 50.4 %, 33.2 % and 16.4 %, respectively for carbohydrates, fat, and protein. High carbohydrate intake was associated with low fat intake. There was a strong negative association (L = -0.37; p &lt; 0.001) between the protein EC and TEI. Each percent of energy intake from protein reduced TEI by 77 kJ on average, ceteris paribus. BMI was unassociated with TEI in this cohort, so the PLH could not be tested here.

CONCLUSIONSFindings indicate clear evidence for PL on TEI, but not on BMI, likely because TEI and BMI become increasingly uncoupled during aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundChildren hospitalised with severe malnutrition (SM) have high mortality and relapse/readmission rates. Current milk-based formulations targets restoring ponderal growth but not modification of gut barrier integrety or microbiome which increase risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes.

ObjectivesWe propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes.

MethodsWe conducted at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda an open-label Phase II trial involving 160 Ugandan children with SM (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt;11.5cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n=80) versus WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n=80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to Day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (&gt;5 g/kg/day), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution.

FindingsIncrease in Day 90 MUAC was similar in LF and WHO arms (1.1 cm (interquatile range.IQR 1.1) vs 1.4cm (IQR 1.40) p=0.09. Day 90 mortality was similar 11/80 (13.8%) vs 12/80 (15%) respectively OR 0.91 (0.40 -2.07) p=0.83. There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the legume feed 10 children switched to WHO feeds. Per protocol analysis indicated a non-significant trend to lower Day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the legume feed (6/60: (10%) and (2/60: 3%) vs WHO feeds (12/71: 17.5%) and (4/71: 6%) respectively.

ConclusionFurther refinement of legume feeds and clinical trials are warrented given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition.
