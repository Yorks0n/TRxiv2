We present the FooDOxS database, a comprehensive compilation of DOxS content in over 1,680 food items from 120 publications across 25 countries, augmented by internal lab data. Our analysis discerns DOxS exposure in diverse diets, differentiating between plant-based and animal-based sources. Notably, we evaluate the efficacy of NOVA and WWEIA classifications in capturing DOxS variations across food categories. Our findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of these systems, enhancing their utility for assessing dietary components. This research contributes to the understanding of DOxS in food processing and suggests refinements for classification systems, holding promise for improved food safety and public health assessments.\nDairy consumption and incident cardiovascular disease: a global analysis\nAuthors: Zhuang, P.; Liu, X.; Li, Y.; Wu, Y.; Ye, H.; Wan, X.; Zhang, L.; Ao, Y.; Meng, D.; Tian, Y.; Yu, X.; Zhang, F.; Wang, A.; Zhang, Y.; Jiao, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.23298545\nBACKGROUNDThe role of dairy products in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains highly debated. Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between dairy consumption and CVD risk in Eastern and Western countries. METHODSCohort analyses include 487 212 individuals from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) and 418 895 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB). Dairy consumption was assessed by validated food frequency questionnaires. We calculated hazard ratios using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models. The primary outcome was incident CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. An updated meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was further conducted. RESULTSA total of 98 954 CVD cases occurred during a mean follow-up of 8.6 years in CKB and 11.3 years in UKB. In CKB, regular dairy consumption (mainly liquid whole milk) was not associated with CVD risk but significantly associated with a 9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 13%) higher CHD risk and a 6% (95% CI, 3% to 9%) lower stroke risk compared with non/rare consumers. In UKB, total dairy consumption was associated with lower risk of CVD, CHD and ischemic stroke. Cheese consumption was associated with lower CVD risk. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% CIs) comparing [\u0026ge;] 7 times/week to the \u003c 2 times/week of cheese were 0.88 (0.83-0.94) for CVD, 0.88 (0.82-0.94) for CHD, and 0.97 (0.85-1.11) for stroke. Semi-skimmed milk consumers had decreased risk of CVD and stroke. In the updated meta-analysis, total dairy consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD (relative risk [RR], 0.963; 95% CI, 0.932 to 0.995; 26 risk estimates) and stroke (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.98; 14 risk estimates). Inverse associations with CVD incidence were found for cheese (0.94; 0.91 to 0.97; 20 risk estimates) and low-fat dairy (0.96; 0.92 to 0.99; 20 risk estimates) but not milk and yogurt.
