OBJECTIVE: To explore diet order effects on energy balance and food intake between randomized diet order groups in two inpatient crossover studies originally designed to compare within-subject differences in ad libitum energy intake between either minimally processed low carbohydrate (LC) versus low fat (LF) diets or macronutrient-matched diets composed of mostly minimally processed food (MPF) or ultra-processed food (UPF). METHODS: Diet order group comparisons of changes in body weight, body composition, and differences in energy expenditure, and food intake were assessed over four weeks in 20 adults randomized to either the LC followed immediately by the LF diet (LC[-\u0026gt;]LF) or the opposite order (LF[-\u0026gt;]LC) as well as 20 adults randomized to either the MPF followed by UPF (MPF[-\u0026gt;]UPF) diets or the opposite order (UPF[-\u0026gt;]MPF). RESULTS: Subjects randomized to LC[-\u0026gt;]LF lost 2.9 {+/-} 1.1 kg more body weight (p \u003c 0.001) and 1.5 {+/-} 0.6 kg more body fat (p = 0.03) than the LF[-\u0026gt;]LC group likely because the LC[-\u0026gt;]LF group consumed 922 {+/-} 304 kcal/d less than the LF[-\u0026gt;]LC group (p = 0.0024). Reduced energy intake in LC[-\u0026gt;]LF vs LF[-\u0026gt;]LC was driven by the last two weeks (-1610 {+/-} 306 kcal/d; p\u003c0.00001) perhaps due to carryover effects of gut adaptations over the first two weeks arising from large differences in the mass of food (1295 {+/-} 209 g/d; p\u003c0.00001) and fiber intake (58 {+/-} 5 g/d; p\u003c0.00001). There were no diet order effects on ad libitum energy intake, body weight, or body composition change between UPF[-\u0026gt;]MPF versus MPF[-\u0026gt;]UPF groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diet order influences daily ad libitum energy intake, body weight change, and fat change within the context of a 4-week crossover inpatient diet study varying in macronutrients, but not varying in extent and purpose of processing.\nPremature deaths attributable to the consumption of ultra-processed foods: a comparative assessment modelling study in eight countries\nAuthors: Nilson, E. A. F.; Delpino, F. M.; Batis, C.; Machado, P. P.; Moubarac, J.-C.; Cediel, G.; Corvalan, C.; Ferrari, G.; Rauber, F.; Martinez-Steele, E.; Louzada, M. L.; Levy, R. B.; Monteiro, C. A.; Rezende, L. F. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296603\nBackground: Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are becoming dominant in the global food and supply. Prospective cohort studies have found an association between UPF dietary pattern and increased risk of several non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. In this study, we (1) estimated the risk of all-cause mortality associated for each 10% increase in the share of UPF consumption in the total energy intake; (2) estimated the population attributable fractions (PAF) and the total number of premature deaths attributable to the consumption of UPF in adults (30-69 years) from 8 selected countries. Methods: First, we performed a dose-response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies assessing the association between UPFs dietary pattern and all-cause mortality. As we found evidence of linearity, we estimated the pooled RR (and its 95% CI) for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the % UPF. Then, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of premature all-cause mortality attributable to UPF in 8 selected countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, UK, and US) UPF consumption. Results: We found a linear dose-response association between UPF intake and all-cause mortality, with a 2.7% increased risk of all-cause mortality per 10% increase in the % UPF. Considering the magnitude of the association between UPFs intake and all-cause mortality, and the dietary share of UPF in each of the 8 selected countries, we estimated that 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and United States) of premature deaths were attributable to UPF intake. Conclusions: Our findings support that UPF intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.\nAn Exploratory Study to Detect the Effects of the Combined Intake of Gamma-aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and L-theanine on Sleep by Wearable Device\nAuthors: Konno, H.; Murotani, R.; Kamada, Y.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296182\nObjectivesSleep disorders are a global issue, and supplements for sleep and new devices for daily sleep status assessment are becoming widely available. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and L-theanine are commonly used dietary supplements to improve sleep. This study examined whether the combined GABA (700 mg/day) and L-theanine (200 mg/day) intake improve sleep in adults with sleep problems and whether the Fitbit Charge 5 can detect sleep status changes the supplements induced. MethodsParticipants received the supplements for four weeks, and changes in sleep quality measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep-related data measured by the Fitbit Charge 5 were evaluated before and after the intake of the supplements. ResultsResults obtained from 19 participants indicated significant improvement in the total PSQI score (9.42 {+/-} 1.80 to 6.26 {+/-} 1.66 (mean {+/-} standard deviation), p\u003c0.001). Sleep score improvement was insignificant for the Fitbit data(N=17). However, sleep recovery scores improved significantly (p=0.042). In addition, heart rate during sleep decreased with a significant difference of 1.3 bpm decrease in the first week of intake (p = 0.045). ConclusionsThe simultaneous intake of GABA and L-theanine improved sleep in adults, and the Fitbit Charge 5 could detect improvements in objective information regarding sleep status.\n",

Methods: First, we performed a dose-response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies assessing the association between UPFs dietary pattern and all-cause mortality. As we found evidence of linearity, we estimated the pooled RR (and its 95% CI) for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the % UPF. Then, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of premature all-cause mortality attributable to UPF in 8 selected countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, UK, and US) UPF consumption. Results: We found a linear dose-response association between UPF intake and all-cause mortality, with a 2.7% increased risk of all-cause mortality per 10% increase in the % UPF. Considering the magnitude of the association between UPFs intake and all-cause mortality, and the dietary share of UPF in each of the 8 selected countries, we estimated that 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and United States) of premature deaths were attributable to UPF intake. Conclusions: Our findings support that UPF intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesSleep disorders are a global issue, and supplements for sleep and new devices for daily sleep status assessment are becoming widely available. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and L-theanine are commonly used dietary supplements to improve sleep. This study examined whether the combined GABA (700 mg/day) and L-theanine (200 mg/day) intake improve sleep in adults with sleep problems and whether the Fitbit Charge 5 can detect sleep status changes the supplements induced.

MethodsParticipants received the supplements for four weeks, and changes in sleep quality measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep-related data measured by the Fitbit Charge 5 were evaluated before and after the intake of the supplements.

ResultsResults obtained from 19 participants indicated significant improvement in the total PSQI score (9.42 {&#43;/-} 1.80 to 6.26 {&#43;/-} 1.66 (mean {&#43;/-} standard deviation), p&lt;0.001). Sleep score improvement was insignificant for the Fitbit data(N=17). However, sleep recovery scores improved significantly (p=0.042). In addition, heart rate during sleep decreased with a significant difference of 1.3 bpm decrease in the first week of intake (p = 0.045).

ConclusionsThe simultaneous intake of GABA and L-theanine improved sleep in adults, and the Fitbit Charge 5 could detect improvements in objective information regarding sleep status.</p>
