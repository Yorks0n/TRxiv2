M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.23293102\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are a common cause of soft tissue injuries in young active individuals, leading to a significant risk of premature joint degeneration. Postoperative management of such injuries, in particular returning patients to athletic activities, is a challenge with immediate and long-term implications including the risk of subsequent injury. In this study, we present LigaNET, a multi-modal deep learning pipeline that predicts the risk of subsequent ACL injury following surgical treatment. Postoperative MRIs (n=1,762) obtained longitudinally between 3 to 24 months after ACL surgery from a cohort of 159 patients along with 11 non-imaging outcomes were used to train and test: 1) a 3D CNN to predict subsequent ACL injury from segmented ACLs, 2) a 3D CNN to predict injury from the whole MRI, 3) a logistic regression classifier predict injury from non-imaging data, and 4) a multi-modal pipeline by fusing the predictions of each classifier. The CNN using the segmented ACL achieved an accuracy of 77.6% and AUROC of 0.84, which was significantly better than the CNN using the whole knee MRI (accuracy: 66.6%, AUROC: 0.70; P\u003c.001) and the non-imaging classifier (accuracy: 70.1%, AUROC: 0.75; P=.039). The fusion of all three classifiers resulted in highest classification performance (accuracy: 80.6%, AUROC: 0.89), which was significantly better than each individual classifier (P\u003c.001). The developed multi-modal approach had similar performance in predicting the risk of subsequent ACL injury from any of the imaging sequences (P\u003e.10). Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach can achieve high performance in identifying patients at high risk of subsequent ACL injury after surgery and may be used in clinical decision making to improve postoperative management (e.g., safe return to sports) of ACL injured patients.\nInterdisciplinary Inquiry via PanelGPT: Application to Explore Chatbot Application in Sports Rehabilitation\nAuthors: McBee, J. C.; Han, D. Y.; Liu, L.; Ma, L.; Adjeroh, D. A.; Xu, D.; Hu, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.23292452\nBackgroundChatGPT showcases exceptional conversational capabilities and extensive cross-disciplinary knowledge. In addition, it possesses the ability to perform multiple roles within a single chat session. This unique multi-role-playing feature positions ChatGPT as a promising tool to explore interdisciplinary subjects. ObjectiveThe study intended to guide ChatGPT for interdisciplinary exploration through simulated panel discussions. As a proof-of-concept, we employed this method to evaluate the advantages and challenges of using chatbots in sports rehabilitation. MethodsWe proposed a model termed PanelGPT to explore ChatGPTs knowledge graph on interdisciplinary topics through simulated panel discussions. Applied to \"chatbots in sports rehabilitation\", ChatGPT role-played both the moderator and panelists, which included a physiotherapist, psychologist, nutritionist, AI expert, and an athlete. We act as the audience posed questions to the panel, with ChatGPT acting as both the panelists for responses and the moderator for hosting the discussion. We performed the simulation using the ChatGPT-4 model and evaluated the responses with existing literature and human expertise. ResultsEach simulation mimicked a real-life panel discussion: The moderator introduced the panel and posed opening/closing questions, to which all panelists responded. The experts engaged with each other to address inquiries from the audience, primarily from their respective fields of expertise. By tackling questions related to education, physiotherapy, physiology, nutrition, and ethical consideration, the discussion highlighted benefits such as 24/7 support, personalized advice, automated tracking, and reminders. It also emphasized the importance of user education and identified challenges such as limited interaction modes, inaccuracies in emotion-related advice, assurance on data privacy and security, transparency in data handling, and fairness in model training. The panelists reached a consensus that chatbots are designed to assist, not replace, human healthcare professionals in the rehabilitation process. ConclusionsCompared to a typical conversation with ChatGPT, the multi-perspective approach of PanelGPT facilitates a comprehensive understanding of an interdisciplinary topic by integrating insights from experts with complementary knowledge. Beyond addressing the exemplified topic of chatbots in sports rehabilitation, the model can be adapted to tackle a wide array of interdisciplinary topics within educational, research, and healthcare settings.\n",
