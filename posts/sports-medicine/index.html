While the potential of exercise to influence this microbiome has been increasingly recognized, findings remain incongruous. This systematic review examined the effects of exercise on the gut microbiome of human and animal models. Databases (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched up to June 2022. Thirty-two exercise studies, i.e., 19 human studies, and 13 animal studies with a minimum of two groups that discussed microbiome outcomes, such as diversity, taxonomic composition, or microbial metabolites, over the intervention period, were included in the systematic review (PROSPERO registration numbers: CRD42023394223 and CRD42023394485). Results indicated that over 50% of studies found no significant exercise effect on human microbial diversity. When evident, exercise often augmented the Shannon index, reflecting enhanced microbial richness and evenness, irrespective of disease status. Changes in beta-diversity metrics were also documented with exercise but without clear directionality. A larger percentage of animal studies demonstrated shifts in diversity compared to human studies, but without any distinct patterns, mainly due to the varied effects of predominantly aerobic exercise on diversity metrics. In terms of taxonomic composition, in humans, exercise usually led to a decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and consistent increases with Bacteroides and Roseburia genera. In animal models, Coprococcus, a SCFA producer, consistently rose with exercise. Generally, SCFA producers were found to increase with exercise in animal models. With regard to metabolites, SCFAs emerged as the most frequently measured metabolite. However, due to limited human and animal studies examining exercise effects on microbial-produced metabolites, including SCFAs, clear patterns did not emerge. The overall risk of bias was deemed neutral. In conclusion, this comprehensive systematic review underscores that exercise can potentially impact the gut microbiome with indications of changes in taxonomic composition. The significant variability in study designs and intervention protocols demands more standardized methodologies and robust statistical models. A nuanced understanding of the exercise-microbiome relationship could guide individualized exercise programs to optimize health.\n",
