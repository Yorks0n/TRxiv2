A.; Xu, D.; Hu, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.23292452\nBackgroundChatGPT showcases exceptional conversational capabilities and extensive cross-disciplinary knowledge. In addition, it possesses the ability to perform multiple roles within a single chat session. This unique multi-role-playing feature positions ChatGPT as a promising tool to explore interdisciplinary subjects. ObjectiveThe study intended to guide ChatGPT for interdisciplinary exploration through simulated panel discussions. As a proof-of-concept, we employed this method to evaluate the advantages and challenges of using chatbots in sports rehabilitation. MethodsWe proposed a model termed PanelGPT to explore ChatGPTs knowledge graph on interdisciplinary topics through simulated panel discussions. Applied to \"chatbots in sports rehabilitation\", ChatGPT role-played both the moderator and panelists, which included a physiotherapist, psychologist, nutritionist, AI expert, and an athlete. We act as the audience posed questions to the panel, with ChatGPT acting as both the panelists for responses and the moderator for hosting the discussion. We performed the simulation using the ChatGPT-4 model and evaluated the responses with existing literature and human expertise. ResultsEach simulation mimicked a real-life panel discussion: The moderator introduced the panel and posed opening/closing questions, to which all panelists responded. The experts engaged with each other to address inquiries from the audience, primarily from their respective fields of expertise. By tackling questions related to education, physiotherapy, physiology, nutrition, and ethical consideration, the discussion highlighted benefits such as 24/7 support, personalized advice, automated tracking, and reminders. It also emphasized the importance of user education and identified challenges such as limited interaction modes, inaccuracies in emotion-related advice, assurance on data privacy and security, transparency in data handling, and fairness in model training. The panelists reached a consensus that chatbots are designed to assist, not replace, human healthcare professionals in the rehabilitation process. ConclusionsCompared to a typical conversation with ChatGPT, the multi-perspective approach of PanelGPT facilitates a comprehensive understanding of an interdisciplinary topic by integrating insights from experts with complementary knowledge. Beyond addressing the exemplified topic of chatbots in sports rehabilitation, the model can be adapted to tackle a wide array of interdisciplinary topics within educational, research, and healthcare settings.\nAccumulating Sedentary Time and Physical Activity from Childhood to Adolescence and Cardiac Function in Adolescence\nAuthors: Haapala, E.; Leppänen, M. H.; Lee, E. M.; Savonen, K. P.; Laukkanen, J. A.; Kähönen, M.; Brage, S.; Lakka, T. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292912\nBackgroundLittle is known about the associations of a sedentary lifestyle from childhood with cardiac work and function during adolescence. We studied if cumulative sedentary time and physical activity from childhood to adolescence are associated with cardiac work and function in adolescence. MethodsA total of 153 adolescents aged 15 years at the time of assessment of cardiac work and function participated. We assessed sedentary time and physical activity using a combined movement and heart rate sensor in childhood and adolescence (baseline, 2- and 8-year follow-ups) and cardiac work and function using impedance cardiography in adolescence (8-year follow-up). ResultsCumulative sedentary time from baseline over the follow-up was directly (standardised regression coefficient {beta}=0.245 to 0.246, 95% confidence intervals, CI=0.092 to 0.400) and moderate to vigorous physical activity ({beta}=-0.355 to -0.323, 95% CI=-0.579 to - 0.119), and vigorous physical activity ({beta}=-0.305 to -0.295, 95% CI=-0.524 to -0.083) from baseline over the follow-up was inversely associated with cardiac work at 8-year follow-up. Cumulative vigorous physical activity from baseline to 2- and 8-year follow-up was inversely associated with cardiac work index at 8-year follow-up ({beta}=-0.225 to -0.218, 95% CI=-0.450 to 0.000). However, adiposity and other cardiometabolic risk factors partially explained these associations. ConclusionsHigher levels of sedentary time and lower levels of moderate and/or vigorous-intensity physical activity during childhood were associated with higher cardiac work in adolescence. These findings highlight the importance of obesity prevention and weight management and promotion physically active lifestyle since childhood to prevent abnormalities in cardiac function later in life. CLINICAL PERSPECTIVEO_LISedentary lifestyle increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, but little is known about the role of sedentary time and physical activity in cardiac work and function in youth.
