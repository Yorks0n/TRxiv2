ObjectivesTo investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers. MethodsWe examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). ResultsLong COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709). ConclusionReactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.\nCortical thickness alterations and systemic inflammation define long-COVID patients with cognitive impairment\nAuthors: Besteher, B.; Rocktaeschel, T.; Garza, A. P.; Machnik, M.; Ballez, J.; Helbing, D. L.; Finke, K.; Reuken, P.; Guellmar, D.; Gaser, C.; Walter, M.; Opel, N.; Dunay, I. R.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292988\nAs the heterogeneity of symptoms is increasingly recognized among long-COVID patients, it appears highly relevant to study potential pathophysiological differences along the different subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests distinct alterations in brain structure and systemic inflammatory patterns in specific groups of long-COVID patients. To this end, we analyzed differences in cortical thickness and peripheral immune signature between clinical subgroups based on 3T-MRI scans and signature inflammatory markers in n=120 participants comprising healthy never-infected controls, healthy COVID-19 survivors, and subgroups of long-COVID patients with and without cognitive impairment according to screening with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Whole-brain comparison of cortical thickness between the 4 groups was conducted by surface-based morphometry. We identified distinct cortical areas showing a progressive increase in cortical thickness across different groups, starting from healthy individuals who had never been infected with COVID-19, followed by healthy COVID-19 survivors, long-COVID patients without cognitive deficits (MoCA [\u0026ge;] 26), and finally, long-COVID patients exhibiting significant cognitive deficits (MoCA \u003c 26). These findings highlight the continuum of cortical thickness alterations associated with COVID-19, with more pronounced changes observed in individuals experiencing cognitive impairment (p\u003c0.05, FWE-corrected). Affected cortical regions covered prefrontal and temporal gyri, insula, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal areas. Additionally, we discovered a distinct immunophenotype, with elevated levels of IL-10, IFN{gamma}, and sTREM2 in long-COVID patients, especially in the group suffering from cognitive impairment. We demonstrate lingering cortical and immunological alterations in healthy and impaired subgroups of COVID-19 survivors. This implies a complex underlying pathomechanism in long-COVID and emphasizes the necessity to investigate the whole spectrum of post-COVID biology to determine targeted treatment strategies targeting specific sub-groups.\nFamilial risk of postpartum psychosis\nAuthors: Kepinska, A. P.; Robakis, T.; Humphreys, K.; Liu, X.; Kahn, R. S.; Munk-Olsen, T.; Bergink, V.; Mahjani, B.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292910\nBackgroundPostpartum psychosis, a mood disorder triggered by childbirth, is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined. MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk. FindingsRelative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 13{middle dot}77 (95% CI 8{middle dot}52-20{middle dot}91) when adjusted for age at birth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1{middle dot}88 [95% CI 0{middle dot}74-3{middle dot}82]). In full siblings, the relative recurrence risk for severe postpartum psychosis requiring inpatient diagnosis was even higher than the risk for inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (18{middle dot}13 [95% CI 11{middle dot}12-27{middle dot}57]). InterpretationIncreased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings is likely due to a combination of genetic factors and shared environment. The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.\nBlood epigenome-wide association studies of suicide attempt in adults with bipolar disorder\nAuthors: Mirza, S.; Lima, C. N. d. C.; Del Favero-Campbell, A.; Rubinstein, A.; Topolski, N. L.; Cabrera-Mendoza, B.; Kovacs, E. H. C.; Blumberg, H. P.; Richards, J. G.; Williams, A. J.; Wemmie, J. A.; Magnotta, V. A.; Fiedorowicz, J. G.; Gaine, M. E.; Walss-Bass, C.; Quevedo, J.; Soares, J. C.; Fries, G. R.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292968\nSuicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at \u003e 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohorts significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD.\nReplication of a neuroimaging biomarker for striatal dysfunction in psychosis\nAuthors: Rubio, J. M.; Lencz, T.; Cao, H.; Kraguljac, N.; Dhamala, E.; Homan, P.; Horga, G.; Sarpal, D.; Argyelan, M.; Gallego, J.; Cholewa, J.; Barber, A.; Kane, J.; Malhotra, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292779\nTo bring biomarkers closer to clinical application, they should be generalizable, reliable, and maintain performance within the constraints of routine clinical conditions. The functional striatal abnormalities (FSA), is among the most advanced neuroimaging biomarkers in schizophrenia, trained to discriminate diagnosis, with post-hoc analyses indicating prognostic properties. Here, we attempt to replicate its diagnostic capabilities measured by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic curves discriminating individuals with psychosis (n=101) from healthy controls (n=51) in the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. We also measured the test-retest (run 1 vs 2) and phase encoding direction (i.e., AP vs PA) reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Additionally, we measured effects of scan length on classification accuracy (i.e., AUCs) and reliability (i.e., ICCs). Finally, we tested the prognostic capability of the FSA by the correlation between baseline scores and symptom improvement over 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in a separate cohort (n=97). Similar analyses were conducted for the Yeo networks intrinsic connectivity as a reference. The FSA had good/excellent diagnostic discrimination (AUC=75.4%, 95%CI=67.0%-83.3%; in non-affective psychosis AUC=80.5%, 95%CI=72.1-88.0%, and in affective psychosis AUC=58.7%, 95%CI=44.2-72.0%). Test-retest reliability ranged between ICC=0.48 (95%CI=0.35-0.59) and ICC=0.22 (95%CI=0.06-0.36), which was comparable to that of networks intrinsic connectivity. Phase encoding direction reliability for the FSA was ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59), generally lower than for networks intrinsic connectivity. By increasing scan length from 2 to 10 minutes, diagnostic classification of the FSA increased from AUC=71.7% (95%CI=63.1%-80.3%) to 75.4% (95%CI=67.0%-83.3%) and phase encoding direction reliability from ICC=0.29 (95%CI=0.14-0.43) to ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59). FSA scores did not correlate with symptom improvement. These results reassure that the FSA is a generalizable diagnostic - but not prognostic - biomarker. Given the replicable results of the FSA as a diagnostic biomarker trained on case-control datasets, next the development of prognostic biomarkers should be on treatment-response data.\nNEURAL RESPONSE TO THREAT AND REWARD AMONG YOUNG ADULTS AT RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER\nAuthors: Kirk-Provencher, K. T.; Hakimi, R.; Andereas, K.; Penner, A. E.; Gowin, J. L.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292969\nAlcohol use disorder is 50% heritable; those with positive family histories represent an at-risk group within which we can test anticipation of threat and reward prior to development of harmful alcohol use. We examined neural correlates of the interaction between family history, threat anticipation (unpredictable threat), and monetary reward anticipation, in a sample of healthy young adults with (n=31) and without (n=44) family histories of harmful alcohol use. We used a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task with sustained threat of hearing a scream during fMRI. We examined the interaction between family history group, anticipation of threat, and anticipation of reward in the insula, nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex. Family history positive individuals showed less activation in the left insula during both safe and threat blocks compared to family history negative individuals (p=0.005), but the groups did not differ as a function of unpredictable threat (p\u003e0.70). We found an interaction (p=0.048) between cue and group in the right nucleus accumbens where the family history positive group showed less differentiation to the anticipation of gaining $5 and losing $5 relative to gaining $0. The family history positive group also reported less excitement for trials to gain $5 relative to gaining $0 (p\u003c0.001). Prior to chronic heavy alcohol use, individuals with, relative to without, enriched risk may have diminished reward processing via both neural and behavioral markers to potential rewarding and negative consequences. Neural response to unpredictable threat may not be a contributing factor to risk at this stage.\nDifferential modulation of attentional ERPs in smoked and insufflated cocaine-dependent associated with neuropsychological performance\nAuthors: Aragon-Daud, A.; Oberti de Luca, S. M.; Schurmann Vignaga, S.; Prado, P.; Figueras, R.; Lizaso, L.; Gonzalez-Gadea, M. L.; Manes, F.; Cetkovich, M.; Pallavicini, C.; Torralva, T.; de la Fuente, L. A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292384\nBackgroundCocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b. MethodsWe examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks. ResultsAt the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down. ConclusionsDifferent routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.\nDynamicity of brain network organization and their community architecture as characterizing features for classification of common mental disorders from the whole-brain connectome\nAuthors: Sastry, N. C.; Banerjee, A.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292699\nThe urgency of addressing common mental disorders (bipolar disorder, ADHD, and schizophrenia) arises from their significant societal impact. Developing strategies to support psychiatrists is crucial. Previous studies focused on the relationship between these disorders and changes in the resting-state functional connectomes modularity, often using static functional connectivity (sFC) estimation. However, understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks with rich temporal structure is essential for comprehending neural activity and addressing mental health disorders. This study proposes an unsupervised approach combining spatial and temporal characterization of brain networks to classify common mental disorders using fMRI timeseries data from two cohorts (N=408 participants). We employ the weighted stochastic block model to uncover mesoscale community architecture differences, providing insights into neural organization. Our approach overcomes sFC limitations and biases in community detection algorithms by modelling the functional connectomes temporal dynamics as a landscape, quantifying temporal stability at whole-brain and network levels. Findings reveal individuals with schizophrenia exhibit less assortative community structure and participate in multiple motif classes, indicating less specialized neural organization. Patients with schizophrenia and ADHD demonstrate significantly reduced temporal stability compared to healthy controls. This study offers insights into functional connectivity (FC) patterns spatiotemporal organization and their alterations in common mental disorders, highlighting the potential of temporal stability as a biomarker.\n",

        <p class="abstract">AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPersistent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reactivation of dormant viruses, and immune-oxidative responses are involved in Long COVID.

ObjectivesTo investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers.

MethodsWe examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5&#39;-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR).

ResultsLong COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709).

ConclusionReactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the heterogeneity of symptoms is increasingly recognized among long-COVID patients, it appears highly relevant to study potential pathophysiological differences along the different subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests distinct alterations in brain structure and systemic inflammatory patterns in specific groups of long-COVID patients.

To this end, we analyzed differences in cortical thickness and peripheral immune signature between clinical subgroups based on 3T-MRI scans and signature inflammatory markers in n=120 participants comprising healthy never-infected controls, healthy COVID-19 survivors, and subgroups of long-COVID patients with and without cognitive impairment according to screening with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Whole-brain comparison of cortical thickness between the 4 groups was conducted by surface-based morphometry.

We identified distinct cortical areas showing a progressive increase in cortical thickness across different groups, starting from healthy individuals who had never been infected with COVID-19, followed by healthy COVID-19 survivors, long-COVID patients without cognitive deficits (MoCA [&amp;ge;] 26), and finally, long-COVID patients exhibiting significant cognitive deficits (MoCA &lt; 26). These findings highlight the continuum of cortical thickness alterations associated with COVID-19, with more pronounced changes observed in individuals experiencing cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.05, FWE-corrected). Affected cortical regions covered prefrontal and temporal gyri, insula, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal areas. Additionally, we discovered a distinct immunophenotype, with elevated levels of IL-10, IFN{gamma}, and sTREM2 in long-COVID patients, especially in the group suffering from cognitive impairment.

We demonstrate lingering cortical and immunological alterations in healthy and impaired subgroups of COVID-19 survivors. This implies a complex underlying pathomechanism in long-COVID and emphasizes the necessity to investigate the whole spectrum of post-COVID biology to determine targeted treatment strategies targeting specific sub-groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPostpartum psychosis, a mood disorder triggered by childbirth, is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined.

MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk.

FindingsRelative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 13{middle dot}77 (95% CI 8{middle dot}52-20{middle dot}91) when adjusted for age at birth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1{middle dot}88 [95% CI 0{middle dot}74-3{middle dot}82]). In full siblings, the relative recurrence risk for severe postpartum psychosis requiring inpatient diagnosis was even higher than the risk for inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (18{middle dot}13 [95% CI 11{middle dot}12-27{middle dot}57]).

InterpretationIncreased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings is likely due to a combination of genetic factors and shared environment. The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Suicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at &gt; 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohorts significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To bring biomarkers closer to clinical application, they should be generalizable, reliable, and maintain performance within the constraints of routine clinical conditions. The functional striatal abnormalities (FSA), is among the most advanced neuroimaging biomarkers in schizophrenia, trained to discriminate diagnosis, with post-hoc analyses indicating prognostic properties. Here, we attempt to replicate its diagnostic capabilities measured by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic curves discriminating individuals with psychosis (n=101) from healthy controls (n=51) in the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. We also measured the test-retest (run 1 vs 2) and phase encoding direction (i.e., AP vs PA) reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Additionally, we measured effects of scan length on classification accuracy (i.e., AUCs) and reliability (i.e., ICCs). Finally, we tested the prognostic capability of the FSA by the correlation between baseline scores and symptom improvement over 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in a separate cohort (n=97). Similar analyses were conducted for the Yeo networks intrinsic connectivity as a reference. The FSA had good/excellent diagnostic discrimination (AUC=75.4%, 95%CI=67.0%-83.3%; in non-affective psychosis AUC=80.5%, 95%CI=72.1-88.0%, and in affective psychosis AUC=58.7%, 95%CI=44.2-72.0%). Test-retest reliability ranged between ICC=0.48 (95%CI=0.35-0.59) and ICC=0.22 (95%CI=0.06-0.36), which was comparable to that of networks intrinsic connectivity. Phase encoding direction reliability for the FSA was ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59), generally lower than for networks intrinsic connectivity. By increasing scan length from 2 to 10 minutes, diagnostic classification of the FSA increased from AUC=71.7% (95%CI=63.1%-80.3%) to 75.4% (95%CI=67.0%-83.3%) and phase encoding direction reliability from ICC=0.29 (95%CI=0.14-0.43) to ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59). FSA scores did not correlate with symptom improvement. These results reassure that the FSA is a generalizable diagnostic - but not prognostic - biomarker. Given the replicable results of the FSA as a diagnostic biomarker trained on case-control datasets, next the development of prognostic biomarkers should be on treatment-response data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alcohol use disorder is 50% heritable; those with positive family histories represent an at-risk group within which we can test anticipation of threat and reward prior to development of harmful alcohol use. We examined neural correlates of the interaction between family history, threat anticipation (unpredictable threat), and monetary reward anticipation, in a sample of healthy young adults with (n=31) and without (n=44) family histories of harmful alcohol use. We used a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task with sustained threat of hearing a scream during fMRI. We examined the interaction between family history group, anticipation of threat, and anticipation of reward in the insula, nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex. Family history positive individuals showed less activation in the left insula during both safe and threat blocks compared to family history negative individuals (p=0.005), but the groups did not differ as a function of unpredictable threat (p&gt;0.70). We found an interaction (p=0.048) between cue and group in the right nucleus accumbens where the family history positive group showed less differentiation to the anticipation of gaining $5 and losing $5 relative to gaining $0. The family history positive group also reported less excitement for trials to gain $5 relative to gaining $0 (p&lt;0.001). Prior to chronic heavy alcohol use, individuals with, relative to without, enriched risk may have diminished reward processing via both neural and behavioral markers to potential rewarding and negative consequences. Neural response to unpredictable threat may not be a contributing factor to risk at this stage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b.

MethodsWe examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks.

ResultsAt the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down.

ConclusionsDifferent routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The urgency of addressing common mental disorders (bipolar disorder, ADHD, and schizophrenia) arises from their significant societal impact. Developing strategies to support psychiatrists is crucial. Previous studies focused on the relationship between these disorders and changes in the resting-state functional connectomes modularity, often using static functional connectivity (sFC) estimation. However, understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks with rich temporal structure is essential for comprehending neural activity and addressing mental health disorders. This study proposes an unsupervised approach combining spatial and temporal characterization of brain networks to classify common mental disorders using fMRI timeseries data from two cohorts (N=408 participants). We employ the weighted stochastic block model to uncover mesoscale community architecture differences, providing insights into neural organization. Our approach overcomes sFC limitations and biases in community detection algorithms by modelling the functional connectomes temporal dynamics as a landscape, quantifying temporal stability at whole-brain and network levels. Findings reveal individuals with schizophrenia exhibit less assortative community structure and participate in multiple motif classes, indicating less specialized neural organization. Patients with schizophrenia and ADHD demonstrate significantly reduced temporal stability compared to healthy controls. This study offers insights into functional connectivity (FC) patterns spatiotemporal organization and their alterations in common mental disorders, highlighting the potential of temporal stability as a biomarker.</p>
