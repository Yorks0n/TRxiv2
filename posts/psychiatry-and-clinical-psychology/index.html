However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nPaediatric traumatic brain injury as a risk factor for psychosis and psychotic symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Yau, K.-C.; Revill, G.; Blackman, G.; Shaikh, M.; Bell, V.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.17.23286118\nBackgroundPsychosis is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Paediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) has been cited as a developmental risk factor for psychosis, however this association has never been assessed meta-analytically. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between pTBI and subsequent psychotic disorders/symptoms was performed. The study was pre-registered (CRD42022360772) adopting a random-effects model to estimate meta-analytic odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Paule-Mandel estimator. Subgroup (study location, study design, psychotic disorder vs subthreshold symptoms, assessment type, and adult vs adolescent onset) and meta-regression (quality of evidence) analyses were also performed. The robustness of findings was assessed through sensitivity analyses. The meta-analysis is available online as a computational notebook with an open dataset. ResultsWe identified 10 relevant studies and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Based on a pooled sample size of 479,686, the pooled OR for the association between pTBI and psychosis outcomes was 1.80 (95% CI [1.11, 2.95]). There were no subgroup effects and no outliers. Both psychotic disorder and subthreshold symptoms were associated with pTBI. The overall association remained robust after removal of low-quality studies, however the OR reduced to 1.43 (95% CI [1.04, 1.98]). A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed the association was robust to removal of all but one study which changed the estimate to marginally non-significant. ConclusionsWe report cautious meta-analytic evidence for a positive association between pTBI and future psychosis. New evidence will be key in determining long-term reliability of this finding.\nMachine learning-based classification of Alzheimer's disease and its at-risk states using personality traits, anxiety, and depression\nAuthors: Waschkies, K.; Soch, J.; Darna, M.; Richter, A.; Altenstein, S.; Beyle, A.; Brosseron, F.; Buchholz, F.; Butryn, M.; Dobisch, L.; Ewers, M.; Fliessbach, K.; Gabelin, T.; Glanz, W.; Goerss, D.; Gref, D.; Janowitz, D.; Kilimann, I.; Lohse, A.; Munk, M.

T.; Hetzer, S.; Ramirez, A.; Scheffler, K.; Buerger, K.; Laske, C.; Perneczky, R.; Peters, O.; Priller, J.; Schneider, A.; Spottke, A.; Teipel, S.; Düzel, E.; Jessen, F.; Wiltfang, J.; Schott, B. H.; Kizilirmak, J. M.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.30.22282930\nBackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is often preceded by stages of cognitive impairment, namely subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are established predictors of AD, other non-invasive candidate predictors include personality traits, anxiety, and depression, among others. There predictors offer non-invasive assessment and exhibit changes during AD development and preclinical stages. MethodsIn a cross-sectional design, we comparatively evaluated the predictive value of personality traits (Big Five), geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, apoliprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and CSF biomarkers (tTau, pTau181, A{beta}42/40 ratio) in a multi-class support vector machine classification. Participants included 189 healthy controls (HC), 338 individuals with SCD, 132 with amnestic MCI, and 74 with mild AD from the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). ResultsMean predictive accuracy across all participant groups was highest when utilizing a combination of personality, depression, and anxiety scores. HC were best predicted by a feature set comprised of depression and anxiety scores and participants with AD were best predicted by a feature set containing CSF biomarkers. Classification of participants with SCD or aMCI was near chance level for all assessed feature sets. ConclusionOur results demonstrate predictive value of personality trait and state scores for AD. Importantly, CSF biomarkers, personality, depression, anxiety, and ApoE genotype show complementary value for classification of AD and its at-risk stages. Key Points- Multi-class support vector machine classification was used to compare the predictive value of well-established and non-invasive, easy-to-assess candidate variables for classifying participants with healthy cognition, subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and mild Alzheimers disease. - Personality traits, geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, ApoE genotype, and CSF biomarkers were comparatively evaluated. - A combination of personality, anxiety, and depression scores provided the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to CSF biomarkers, indicating complementary value. - Established and candidate predictors had limited success in classifying SCD and aMCI, underscoring the heterogeneity of these cognitive states and emphasizing the need for standardizing terminology and diagnostic criteria.\nPredicting prenatal depression and assessing model bias using machine learning models\nAuthors: Huang, Y.; Alvernaz, S.; Kim, S. J.; Maki, P.; Dai, Y.; Penalver Bernabe, B.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292587\nPerinatal depression (PND) is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum period, affecting 10-20% of pregnant individuals. Black and Latina women have higher rates of PND, yet they are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been effective in predicting postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, which contributed to biases in ML models for minority women. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could serve to predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a hospital in a large urban city that mostly served low-income Black and Hispanic women (N=5,875) in the U.S. Depressive symptom severity was assessed from a self-reported questionnaire, PHQ-9. We investigated multiple ML classifiers, used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for model interpretation, and determined model prediction bias with two metrics, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity Difference. While ML model (Elastic Net) performance was low (ROCAUC=0.67), we identified well-known factors associated with PND, such as unplanned pregnancy and being single, as well as underexplored factors, such as self-report pain levels, lower levels of prenatal vitamin supplement intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels blood. Our findings showed that despite being based on a sample mostly composed of 75% low-income minority women (54% Black and 27% Latina), the model performance was lower for these communities. In conclusion, ML models based on EMRs could moderately predict depression in early pregnancy, but their performance is biased against low-income minority women.\nDynamicity of brain network organization and their community architecture as characterizing features for classification of common mental disorders from the whole-brain connectome\nAuthors: Sastry, N. C.; Banerjee, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292699\nThe urgency of addressing common mental disorders (bipolar disorder, ADHD, and schizophrenia) arises from their significant societal impact. Developing strategies to support psychiatrists is crucial. Previous studies focused on the relationship between these disorders and changes in the resting-state functional connectomes modularity, often using static functional connectivity (sFC) estimation. However, understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks with rich temporal structure is essential for comprehending neural activity and addressing mental health disorders. This study proposes an unsupervised approach combining spatial and temporal characterization of brain networks to classify common mental disorders using fMRI timeseries data from two cohorts (N=408 participants). We employ the weighted stochastic block model to uncover mesoscale community architecture differences, providing insights into neural organization. Our approach overcomes sFC limitations and biases in community detection algorithms by modelling the functional connectomes temporal dynamics as a landscape, quantifying temporal stability at whole-brain and network levels. Findings reveal individuals with schizophrenia exhibit less assortative community structure and participate in multiple motif classes, indicating less specialized neural organization. Patients with schizophrenia and ADHD demonstrate significantly reduced temporal stability compared to healthy controls. This study offers insights into functional connectivity (FC) patterns spatiotemporal organization and their alterations in common mental disorders, highlighting the potential of temporal stability as a biomarker.\nModelling the Longitudinal Dynamics of Paranoia in Psychosis: A Temporal Network Analysis Over 20 Years.\nAuthors: Barnby, J. M.; Haslbeck, J. M. B.; Sharma, R.; Rosen, C.; Harrow, M.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.06.23284268\nParanoia is a highly debilitating, core element of psychosis, although is poorly managed. Theories of paranoia mostly interface with short-scale or cross-sectional data models, leaving the longitudinal course of paranoia underspecified. Here, we develop an empirical characterisation of two aspects of paranoia - persecutory and referential delusions - in individuals with psychosis over 20 years. We examine delusional dynamics by applying a Graphical Vector Autoregression Model to data collected from the Chicago Follow-up Study (n=135 with a range of psychosis-spectrum diagnoses). We adjusted for age, sex, IQ, and antipsychotic use. We found that referential and persecutory delusions are central themes, supported by other primary delusions, and are strongly autoregressive - the presence of referential and persecutory delusions is predictive of their future occurrence. In a second analysis we demonstrate that social factors influence the severity of referential, but not persecutory, delusions. We suggest that persecutory delusions represent central, resistant states in the cognitive landscape, whereas referential beliefs are more flexible, offering an important window of opportunity for intervention. Our data models can be collated with prior biological, computational, and social work to contribute toward a more complete theory of paranoia and provide more time-dependent evidence for optimal treatment targets.

        <p class="abstract">Microdosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPsychosis is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Paediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) has been cited as a developmental risk factor for psychosis, however this association has never been assessed meta-analytically.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between pTBI and subsequent psychotic disorders/symptoms was performed. The study was pre-registered (CRD42022360772) adopting a random-effects model to estimate meta-analytic odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Paule-Mandel estimator. Subgroup (study location, study design, psychotic disorder vs subthreshold symptoms, assessment type, and adult vs adolescent onset) and meta-regression (quality of evidence) analyses were also performed. The robustness of findings was assessed through sensitivity analyses. The meta-analysis is available online as a computational notebook with an open dataset.

ResultsWe identified 10 relevant studies and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Based on a pooled sample size of 479,686, the pooled OR for the association between pTBI and psychosis outcomes was 1.80 (95% CI [1.11, 2.95]). There were no subgroup effects and no outliers. Both psychotic disorder and subthreshold symptoms were associated with pTBI. The overall association remained robust after removal of low-quality studies, however the OR reduced to 1.43 (95% CI [1.04, 1.98]). A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed the association was robust to removal of all but one study which changed the estimate to marginally non-significant.

ConclusionsWe report cautious meta-analytic evidence for a positive association between pTBI and future psychosis. New evidence will be key in determining long-term reliability of this finding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is often preceded by stages of cognitive impairment, namely subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are established predictors of AD, other non-invasive candidate predictors include personality traits, anxiety, and depression, among others. There predictors offer non-invasive assessment and exhibit changes during AD development and preclinical stages.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional design, we comparatively evaluated the predictive value of personality traits (Big Five), geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, apoliprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and CSF biomarkers (tTau, pTau181, A{beta}42/40 ratio) in a multi-class support vector machine classification. Participants included 189 healthy controls (HC), 338 individuals with SCD, 132 with amnestic MCI, and 74 with mild AD from the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE).

ResultsMean predictive accuracy across all participant groups was highest when utilizing a combination of personality, depression, and anxiety scores. HC were best predicted by a feature set comprised of depression and anxiety scores and participants with AD were best predicted by a feature set containing CSF biomarkers. Classification of participants with SCD or aMCI was near chance level for all assessed feature sets.

ConclusionOur results demonstrate predictive value of personality trait and state scores for AD. Importantly, CSF biomarkers, personality, depression, anxiety, and ApoE genotype show complementary value for classification of AD and its at-risk stages.

Key Points- Multi-class support vector machine classification was used to compare the predictive value of well-established and non-invasive, easy-to-assess candidate variables for classifying participants with healthy cognition, subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and mild Alzheimers disease.
- Personality traits, geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, ApoE genotype, and CSF biomarkers were comparatively evaluated.
- A combination of personality, anxiety, and depression scores provided the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to CSF biomarkers, indicating complementary value.
- Established and candidate predictors had limited success in classifying SCD and aMCI, underscoring the heterogeneity of these cognitive states and emphasizing the need for standardizing terminology and diagnostic criteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Perinatal depression (PND) is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum period, affecting 10-20% of pregnant individuals. Black and Latina women have higher rates of PND, yet they are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been effective in predicting postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, which contributed to biases in ML models for minority women. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could serve to predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a hospital in a large urban city that mostly served low-income Black and Hispanic women (N=5,875) in the U.S. Depressive symptom severity was assessed from a self-reported questionnaire, PHQ-9. We investigated multiple ML classifiers, used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for model interpretation, and determined model prediction bias with two metrics, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity Difference. While ML model (Elastic Net) performance was low (ROCAUC=0.67), we identified well-known factors associated with PND, such as unplanned pregnancy and being single, as well as underexplored factors, such as self-report pain levels, lower levels of prenatal vitamin supplement intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels blood. Our findings showed that despite being based on a sample mostly composed of 75% low-income minority women (54% Black and 27% Latina), the model performance was lower for these communities. In conclusion, ML models based on EMRs could moderately predict depression in early pregnancy, but their performance is biased against low-income minority women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The urgency of addressing common mental disorders (bipolar disorder, ADHD, and schizophrenia) arises from their significant societal impact. Developing strategies to support psychiatrists is crucial. Previous studies focused on the relationship between these disorders and changes in the resting-state functional connectomes modularity, often using static functional connectivity (sFC) estimation. However, understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks with rich temporal structure is essential for comprehending neural activity and addressing mental health disorders. This study proposes an unsupervised approach combining spatial and temporal characterization of brain networks to classify common mental disorders using fMRI timeseries data from two cohorts (N=408 participants). We employ the weighted stochastic block model to uncover mesoscale community architecture differences, providing insights into neural organization. Our approach overcomes sFC limitations and biases in community detection algorithms by modelling the functional connectomes temporal dynamics as a landscape, quantifying temporal stability at whole-brain and network levels. Findings reveal individuals with schizophrenia exhibit less assortative community structure and participate in multiple motif classes, indicating less specialized neural organization. Patients with schizophrenia and ADHD demonstrate significantly reduced temporal stability compared to healthy controls. This study offers insights into functional connectivity (FC) patterns spatiotemporal organization and their alterations in common mental disorders, highlighting the potential of temporal stability as a biomarker.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Paranoia is a highly debilitating, core element of psychosis, although is poorly managed. Theories of paranoia mostly interface with short-scale or cross-sectional data models, leaving the longitudinal course of paranoia underspecified. Here, we develop an empirical characterisation of two aspects of paranoia - persecutory and referential delusions - in individuals with psychosis over 20 years. We examine delusional dynamics by applying a Graphical Vector Autoregression Model to data collected from the Chicago Follow-up Study (n=135 with a range of psychosis-spectrum diagnoses). We adjusted for age, sex, IQ, and antipsychotic use. We found that referential and persecutory delusions are central themes, supported by other primary delusions, and are strongly autoregressive - the presence of referential and persecutory delusions is predictive of their future occurrence. In a second analysis we demonstrate that social factors influence the severity of referential, but not persecutory, delusions. We suggest that persecutory delusions represent central, resistant states in the cognitive landscape, whereas referential beliefs are more flexible, offering an important window of opportunity for intervention. Our data models can be collated with prior biological, computational, and social work to contribute toward a more complete theory of paranoia and provide more time-dependent evidence for optimal treatment targets.
