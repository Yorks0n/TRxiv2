This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance. MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes. ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance. ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.\nBridging the gap: improving correspondence between low-field and high-field magnetic resonance images in young people\nAuthors: Cooper, R. E.; Hayes, R.; Corcoran, M.; Sheth, K. N.; Arnold, T. C.; Stein, J.; Glahn, D. C.; Jalbrzikowski, M.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.24300892\nBackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people. MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches. ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume. Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness. ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.\nTranslation of clinical practice guidelines on lifestyle behavior in a psychiatric setting. A discourse analytical case study\nAuthors: Hjorth, C.; mainz, J.; Thomsen, L. L. H.; Boggild, H.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301407\nIntroduction Implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can be constrained by diverging guideline interpretations, leading to a discrepancy between the intended clinical practice and the clinical practice implemented. We examine how CPGs on lifestyle behavior for psychiatric inpatients are translated into clinical daily practice, and how this was affected by discourses surrounding the stakeholders. Methods We conducted a comparative case study within two psychiatric wards in Denmark, wherein a clinical practice guideline (CPG) addressing lifestyle behavior was implemented. The objective of the CPG was to strategically intervene in the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle practices among inpatients. Critical discourse analysis and a perspective of translation formed the theoretical framework. We collected empirical material at two stakeholder levels; the CPG authors and clinicians. This included documents related to the CPGs, field observations and two focus group interviews with clinicians. Results The CPG were composed within a system-centered discourse where lifestyle intervention was considered relevant for all inpatients. The clinicians translated the CPGs within a person-centered discourse and a prioritization discourse, focusing on individual factors such as the patients' own wishes, surplus energy, and the status of the psychiatric treatment. Conclusion The findings show that implementation of guidelines in their original form cannot be anticipated, but will constitute translation based on social structures and their discourses. Unawareness of this phenomenon called translation may affect implementation and should be considered when CPGs are developed and launched. Future research should explore how discourses and social processes among patients influences implementation of CPGs.\nThe interplay between insomnia and Alzheimer Disease across three main brain networks\nAuthors: Elberse, J. D.; Saberi, A.; Ahmadi, R.; Changizi, M.; Bi, H.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Mander, B. A.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301427\nBackgroundInsomnia is prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimers disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). MethodsWe selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC). We tested the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index across groups. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression for each network. Finally, we correlated brain abnormalities with cognitive scores. ResultsInsomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. In the CN and MCI groups, insomnia symptoms were characterized by patterns of within-network hyperconnectivity, while in the AD group, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was observed. FC alterations within and between DMN and CEN hubs were associated with reduced MMSE scores in each of the groups. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN for AD individuals. ConclusionsInsomnia symptoms affect the intrinsic functional organization of the three networks along the AD trajectory. Patients with AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.\nA large-scale online survey of patients and the general public: Preferring safe and noninvasive neuromodulation for mental health\nAuthors: Atkinson-Clement, C.; Junor, A.; Kaiser, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301043\nWhile neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation.\nEffects of Diazepam on Hippocampal Blood Flow in People at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis\nAuthors: Livingston, N. R.; Kiemes, A.; Devenyi, G. A.; Knight, S.; Lukow, P. B.; Jelen, L.; Reilly, T.; Dima, A.; Nettis, M. A.; Casetta, C.; Agyekum, T.; Zelaya, F.; Spencer, T.; De Micheli, A.; Fusar-Poli, P.; Grace, A. A.; Williams, S. C. R.; McGuire, P.; Egerton, A.; Chakravarty, M. M.; Modinos, G.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23299658\nBackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals. MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield. ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 24.1[{+/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 26.5[{+/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR\u003c0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR\u003c0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR\u003c0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225). ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing.

ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission.

DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundResearch on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance.

MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes.

ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance.

ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people.

MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches.

ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume.

Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness.

ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can be constrained by diverging guideline interpretations, leading to a discrepancy between the intended clinical practice and the clinical practice implemented. We examine how CPGs on lifestyle behavior for psychiatric inpatients are translated into clinical daily practice, and how this was affected by discourses surrounding the stakeholders. Methods We conducted a comparative case study within two psychiatric wards in Denmark, wherein a clinical practice guideline (CPG) addressing lifestyle behavior was implemented. The objective of the CPG was to strategically intervene in the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle practices among inpatients. Critical discourse analysis and a perspective of translation formed the theoretical framework. We collected empirical material at two stakeholder levels; the CPG authors and clinicians. This included documents related to the CPGs, field observations and two focus group interviews with clinicians. Results The CPG were composed within a system-centered discourse where lifestyle intervention was considered relevant for all inpatients. The clinicians translated the CPGs within a person-centered discourse and a prioritization discourse, focusing on individual factors such as the patients&#39; own wishes, surplus energy, and the status of the psychiatric treatment. Conclusion The findings show that implementation of guidelines in their original form cannot be anticipated, but will constitute translation based on social structures and their discourses. Unawareness of this phenomenon called translation may affect implementation and should be considered when CPGs are developed and launched. Future research should explore how discourses and social processes among patients influences implementation of CPGs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundInsomnia is prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimers disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN).

MethodsWe selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC), and functional connectivity (FC). We tested the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index across groups. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression for each network. Finally, we correlated brain abnormalities with cognitive scores.

ResultsInsomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. In the CN and MCI groups, insomnia symptoms were characterized by patterns of within-network hyperconnectivity, while in the AD group, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was observed. FC alterations within and between DMN and CEN hubs were associated with reduced MMSE scores in each of the groups. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN for AD individuals.

ConclusionsInsomnia symptoms affect the intrinsic functional organization of the three networks along the AD trajectory. Patients with AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals.

MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield.

ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 24.1[{&#43;/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 26.5[{&#43;/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR&lt;0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR&lt;0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR&lt;0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225).

ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.</p>
