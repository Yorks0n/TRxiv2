ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\nTesting the sensitivity of diagnosis-derived patterns in functional brain networks to symptom burden in a Norwegian youth sample\nAuthors: Voldsbekk, I.; Kjelkenes, R.; Frogner, E. R.; Westlye, L. T.; Alnaes, D.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296736\nAberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established. We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria). Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms. Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.\nGeometry of navigation identifies genetic-risk and clinical Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Lim, U.; Leal-Cervantes, R.; Coughlan, G.; Lambiotte, R.; Spiers, H.; Hornberger, M.; Harrington, H.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296035\nRecent research evidence demonstrates that the inability to orient oneself and navigate space is an early indicator of Alzheimers Disease. The video game Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) was designed to assess the players navigation ability, and several research works analysed the SHQ data using simple metrics such as length and time of navigation paths. Expanding these analyses, we propose new performance metrics that capture the geometry of paths, and analyse datasets of more than 60,000 navigators. The metrics identify players who failed the navigation task, the dementia patients, and carriers of the at-risk allele of the Apolipoprotein-E [APOE]. Furthermore the metrics detect weak navigation ability when only a fraction of navigation paths are used, with superior performance to baseline methods. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed performance metrics pave the way to a comprehensive pre-clinical screening toolbox for Alzheimers Disease. TEASERWe propose geometric methods to capture decline in navigation ability from dementia.\nThe neuronal chromatin landscape in adult schizophrenia brains is linked to early fetal development\nAuthors: Girdhar, K.; Bendl, J.; Baumgartner, A.; Therrien, K.; Venkatesh, S.; Mathur, D.; Dong, P.; Rahman, S.; Kleopoulos, S. P.; Misir, R.; Reach, S. M.; Auluck, P.; Marenco, S.; Lewis, D. A.; Haroutunian, V.; Funk, C.; Voloudakis, G.; Hoffman, G. E.; Fullard, J.; Roussos, P.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296067\nNon-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.\nGenetic neurodevelopmental clustering and dyslexia\nAuthors: Ciulkinyte, A.; Mountford, H. S.; Fontanillas, P.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Bates, T. C.; Martin, N.; Fisher, S. E.; Luciano, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296530\nDyslexia is a learning difficulty with neurodevelopmental origins, manifesting as reduced accuracy and speed in reading and spelling despite adequate education. Dyslexia is substantially heritable and frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this paper was to elucidate how genetic factors predisposing to dyslexia correlate with risk for other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dyslexia diagnosis self-report (51,800 cases and [~]1.1 million controls), together with GWAS of ADHD, autism, Tourette syndrome, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia, were analysed using Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to construct a genomic structural model. The final model consisted of five correlated latent genomic factors described as F1) internalising disorders, F2) psychotic disorders, F3) compulsive disorders, F4) neurodevelopmental conditions, and F5) attention and learning difficulties, which includes ADHD and dyslexia. This latent factor was moderately correlated with internalising disorders (.40) and, to a lesser extent, with neurodevelopmental conditions (.25) and psychotic disorders (.17), and negatively with compulsive disorders (-.16). Unlike ADHD, most of the genomic variance in dyslexia was unique, suggesting a more peripheral relation to psychiatric traits. We further investigated genetic variants underlying both dyslexia and ADHD. This implicated 49 loci (40 of which were not reported in GWAS of the individual traits) mapping to 174 genes (121 not found in GWAS of individual traits). Our study has discovered novel pleiotropic variants and confirms via GenomicSEM the heightened genetic relation between dyslexia and ADHD versus other psychiatric traits. In future, analyses including additional co-occurring traits such as dyscalculia and dyspraxia, for which there are currently no large-scale GWAS, will allow a more clear definition of the attention and learning difficulties genomic factor, yielding further insights into factor structure and pleiotropic effects.\nGenetic networks suggest Asperger's Syndrome as a distinct subtype of Autism Spectrum Conditions\nAuthors: Dmytriw, A. A.; Naveed, S.; Ghozy, S.; Morsy, S.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295892\nBackgroundThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) issued new diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) which excluded cases of Aspergers syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This negatively affected the support received by those affected. In this study, we explored if AS can be considered a subtype of autism. MethodsWe explored if AS is considered a subtype of autism through gene network analysis. We analysed the GEO microarray data of 170 autism patients, then, used a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) pipeline. We explored whether these modules share the same expression patterns across autism subtypes. The study had 170 patients grouped into three groups: AS, autism, and PDD-NOS. ResultsTwenty-one genetic modules were constructed for autism spectrum conditions. However, only AS had a significant downregulation in one of the modules. The module genes were significantly involved in the regulation of proteolysis, catabolic process, and NF-kappaB signalling. Pathway analysis showed the association of these genes with RIPK1-mediated necrosis and regulation of necroptotic cell death. Brain enrichment analysis showed a spatiotemporal distribution. There was significant gene enrichment in the prefrontal cortex during infancy and childhood then it changes in adulthood to be more abundant in the cingulum bundle, and corpus callosum. ConclusionsOur results suggest AS can be a distinct subtype of ASD, showing a similar gene expression pattern. Spatiotemporal distribution of the module genes in different brain regions explains the high functionality in individuals with AS.\nCognitive Processing Speed and Loneliness in Stroke Survivors: Insights from a Large- Scale Cohort Study\nAuthors: Byrne, C.; Coetzer, R.; Ramsey, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296730\nObjective Loneliness, when prolonged, is associated with many deleterious effects and has been shown to be highly prevalent in those with a history of stroke, yet the cognitive mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which cognitive factors, with specific focus on processing speed, are associated with loneliness in those with a history of stroke. Method Utilizing data from the British Cohort Study (BCS), a nationally representative dataset, we conducted secondary data analysis. A total of 7,752 participants completed relevant questions related to health, social interactions, demographics, loneliness, and cognitive assessments. Among them, 47 had experienced a stroke (\"stroke,\" n = 47), 5,545 reported other health conditions (\"ill,\" n = 5,545), and 2,857 were deemed healthy (\"healthy,\" n = 2,857) Results Consistent with previous research, our findings confirmed a positive correlation between stroke history and heightened loneliness. However, inferential analysis revealed that processing speed, alongside other cognitive factors, had a minimal impact on loneliness, with correlations too small to draw definitive conclusions. Conclusion This study suggests that cognitive processing speed alone is not a robust predictor of loneliness in stroke survivors. Consequently, when developing interventions to combat loneliness in this population, it is crucial to consider a broader spectrum of factors, such as social engagement, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships. This underscores the imperative need for comprehensive assessments to better comprehend the multifaceted nature of loneliness and inform more effective intervention strategies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B.

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof.

ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801.

ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established. We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria). Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms. Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent research evidence demonstrates that the inability to orient oneself and navigate space is an early indicator of Alzheimers Disease. The video game Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) was designed to assess the players navigation ability, and several research works analysed the SHQ data using simple metrics such as length and time of navigation paths. Expanding these analyses, we propose new performance metrics that capture the geometry of paths, and analyse datasets of more than 60,000 navigators. The metrics identify players who failed the navigation task, the dementia patients, and carriers of the at-risk allele of the Apolipoprotein-E [APOE]. Furthermore the metrics detect weak navigation ability when only a fraction of navigation paths are used, with superior performance to baseline methods. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed performance metrics pave the way to a comprehensive pre-clinical screening toolbox for Alzheimers Disease.

        <p class="abstract">Non-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dyslexia is a learning difficulty with neurodevelopmental origins, manifesting as reduced accuracy and speed in reading and spelling despite adequate education. Dyslexia is substantially heritable and frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this paper was to elucidate how genetic factors predisposing to dyslexia correlate with risk for other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dyslexia diagnosis self-report (51,800 cases and [~]1.1 million controls), together with GWAS of ADHD, autism, Tourette syndrome, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia, were analysed using Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to construct a genomic structural model. The final model consisted of five correlated latent genomic factors described as F1) internalising disorders, F2) psychotic disorders, F3) compulsive disorders, F4) neurodevelopmental conditions, and F5) attention and learning difficulties, which includes ADHD and dyslexia. This latent factor was moderately correlated with internalising disorders (.40) and, to a lesser extent, with neurodevelopmental conditions (.25) and psychotic disorders (.17), and negatively with compulsive disorders (-.16). Unlike ADHD, most of the genomic variance in dyslexia was unique, suggesting a more peripheral relation to psychiatric traits. We further investigated genetic variants underlying both dyslexia and ADHD. This implicated 49 loci (40 of which were not reported in GWAS of the individual traits) mapping to 174 genes (121 not found in GWAS of individual traits). Our study has discovered novel pleiotropic variants and confirms via GenomicSEM the heightened genetic relation between dyslexia and ADHD versus other psychiatric traits. In future, analyses including additional co-occurring traits such as dyscalculia and dyspraxia, for which there are currently no large-scale GWAS, will allow a more clear definition of the attention and learning difficulties genomic factor, yielding further insights into factor structure and pleiotropic effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) issued new diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) which excluded cases of Aspergers syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This negatively affected the support received by those affected. In this study, we explored if AS can be considered a subtype of autism.

MethodsWe explored if AS is considered a subtype of autism through gene network analysis. We analysed the GEO microarray data of 170 autism patients, then, used a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) pipeline. We explored whether these modules share the same expression patterns across autism subtypes. The study had 170 patients grouped into three groups: AS, autism, and PDD-NOS.

ResultsTwenty-one genetic modules were constructed for autism spectrum conditions. However, only AS had a significant downregulation in one of the modules. The module genes were significantly involved in the regulation of proteolysis, catabolic process, and NF-kappaB signalling. Pathway analysis showed the association of these genes with RIPK1-mediated necrosis and regulation of necroptotic cell death. Brain enrichment analysis showed a spatiotemporal distribution. There was significant gene enrichment in the prefrontal cortex during infancy and childhood then it changes in adulthood to be more abundant in the cingulum bundle, and corpus callosum.

ConclusionsOur results suggest AS can be a distinct subtype of ASD, showing a similar gene expression pattern. Spatiotemporal distribution of the module genes in different brain regions explains the high functionality in individuals with AS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective Loneliness, when prolonged, is associated with many deleterious effects and has been shown to be highly prevalent in those with a history of stroke, yet the cognitive mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which cognitive factors, with specific focus on processing speed, are associated with loneliness in those with a history of stroke. Method Utilizing data from the British Cohort Study (BCS), a nationally representative dataset, we conducted secondary data analysis. A total of 7,752 participants completed relevant questions related to health, social interactions, demographics, loneliness, and cognitive assessments. Among them, 47 had experienced a stroke (&#34;stroke,&#34; n = 47), 5,545 reported other health conditions (&#34;ill,&#34; n = 5,545), and 2,857 were deemed healthy (&#34;healthy,&#34; n = 2,857) Results Consistent with previous research, our findings confirmed a positive correlation between stroke history and heightened loneliness. However, inferential analysis revealed that processing speed, alongside other cognitive factors, had a minimal impact on loneliness, with correlations too small to draw definitive conclusions. Conclusion This study suggests that cognitive processing speed alone is not a robust predictor of loneliness in stroke survivors. Consequently, when developing interventions to combat loneliness in this population, it is crucial to consider a broader spectrum of factors, such as social engagement, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships. This underscores the imperative need for comprehensive assessments to better comprehend the multifaceted nature of loneliness and inform more effective intervention strategies.</p>
