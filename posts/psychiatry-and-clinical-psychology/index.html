A.; Hakimi, N.; Taylor, S.; Kuplicki, R.; Forthman, K. L.; Stewart, J. L.; Paulus, M. P.; Khalsa, S. S.; Smith, R.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296870\nRecent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.\nCovid-19 Related Generalized Anxiety Disorder Among Health Care Workers In A Hospital In The Greater Accra Region\nAuthors: Ohakpougwu, C. E.; Bebobru, W. M.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297097\nBackground The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana. Aim The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD. Results The GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs. Conclusion COVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.\nTwo neurostructural subtypes: results of machine learning on brain images from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia\nAuthors: Jiang, Y.; Luo, C.; Wang, J.; Palaniyappan, L.; Chang, X.; Xiang, S.; Zhang, J.; Duan, M.; Huang, H.; Gaser, C.; Nemoto, K.; Miura, K.; Hashimoto, R.; Westlye, L. T.; Richard, G.; Fernandez-Cabello, S.; Parker, N.; Andreassen, O. A.; Kircher, T.; Nenadi?, I.; Stein, F.; Thomas-Odenthal, F.; Teutenberg, L.; Usemann, P.; Dannlowski, U.; Hahn, T.; Grotegerd, D.; Meinert, S.; Lencer, R.; Tang, Y.; Zhang, T.; Li, C.; Yue, W.; Zhang, Y.; Yu, X.; Zhou, E.; Lin, C.-P.; Tsai, S.-J.; Rodrigue, A. L.; Glahn, D.; Pearlson, G.; Blangero, J.; Karuk, A.; pomarol-Clotet, E.; Salvador, R.; Fuentes-Claramonte, Score: 8.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296862\nMachine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{+/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{+/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Brocas area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.\nWellbeing After Stroke (WAterS): feasibility testing of a co-developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention, to support psychological adjustment after stroke\nAuthors: Patchwood, E.; Foote, H.; Vail, A.; Cotterill, S.; Hill, G.; WAterS PCPI Group, ; Bowen, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296276\nObjective: Feasibility test a co-developed intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to support psychological adjustment post-stroke, delivered by a workforce with community in-reach. Design: Observational feasibility study utilising Patient, Carer, Public Involvement (PCPI). Setting: Online. UK. Participants: Stroke survivors with self-reported psychological distress 4+ months post-stroke Interventions: The co-developed Wellbeing After Stroke (WAterS) intervention includes: nine weekly, structured, online, group sessions for stroke survivors, delivered via a training programme to upskill staff without previous ACT experience, under Clinical Psychology supervision. Main measures: Feasibility of recruitment and retention; data quality from candidate measures; safety. Clinical and demographic information at baseline; Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) via online surveys (baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 3 and 6 months after intervention end) including Mood (HADS), Wellbeing (ONS4), Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ5D5L), Psychological Flexibility (AAQ-ABI) and Values-Based Living (VQ). Results: We trained eight staff and recruited 17 stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate cognitive and communication difficulties. 12/17 (71%) joined three intervention groups with 98% attendance and no related adverse events. PROMS data were well-completed. The HADS is a possible future primary outcome (self-reported depression lower on average by 1.3 points: 8.5 pre-group to 7.1 at 3 month follow up; 95% CI 0.4 to 3.2). Conclusion: The WAterS intervention warrants further research evaluation. Staff can be trained and upskilled to deliver. It appears safe and feasible to deliver online to groups, and study recruitment and data collection are feasible. Funding has been secured to further develop the intervention, considering implementation and health equality.

F.; Maes, M.; Zhou, B.; Al-Hakeim, H.; Vojdani, A.\nScore: 203.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296554\nBackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\nRethinking conceptualizations of adult ADHD and how care is provided: a qualitative study\nAuthors: Ginapp, C. M.; Greenberg, N. R.; Macdonald-Gagnon, G.; Angarita, G. A.; Bold, K. W.; Potenza, M. N.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296967\nBackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that frequently persists into adulthood. Adults with ADHD often have unmet needs including experiencing high rates of substance use disorders, incarceration, and unemployment. Despite having unmet needs, there is little research on how adults with ADHD conceptualize their condition and how they believe the care they receive could be improved. We aimed to better understand what adults with ADHD would like the medical community to know about what it is like to live with ADHD and to characterize possible misconceptions of ADHD they would like to see addressed. MethodNine online focus groups involving young adults (aged 18-35 years, N = 43) recruited from online communities for people with ADHD were conducted. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework. ResultsIndividually, participants reported wanting increased support, education, and rejection of stigma. Structurally, participants reported desiring ADHD to be reframed as a difference as opposed to a disorder, viewing of ADHD as a mismatch with their environments, and wanting the condition to be viewed through the lens of what it is like to embody the condition. ConclusionsIncorporating patient-lived experiences into psychiatric diagnoses may increase diagnostic patient-centeredness and help healthcare providers better meet patient needs.\nTesting the sensitivity of diagnosis-derived patterns in functional brain networks to symptom burden in a Norwegian youth sample\nAuthors: Voldsbekk, I.; Kjelkenes, R.; Frogner, E. R.; Westlye, L. T.; Alnaes, D.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296736\nAberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established. We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria). Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms. Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.\nGenetic relationship between the immune system and autism spectrum disorder and traits\nAuthors: Arenella, M.; Fanelli, G.; Kiemeney, L. A.; McAlonan, G. M.; Murphy, D. G.; Bralten, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23296896\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental condition. The pathophysiology of ASD is poorly defined; however, it includes a strong genetic component and there is increasing evidence to support a role of immune dysregulation. Nonetheless, it is unclear which immune phenotypes link to ASD through genetics. Hence, we investigated the genetic correlation between ASD and diverse classes of immune conditions and markers; and if these immune related genetic factors link to specific autistic like traits in the population. We estimated global and local genetic correlations between ASD (n=55,420) and 11 immune phenotypes (N \u003e 700,000) using genome-wide association study summary statistics. Subsequently, polygenic scores (PGS) for these immune phenotypes were calculated in a population-based sample (n=2,487) and associated to five autistic like traits (i.e., attention to detail, childhood behaviour, imagination, rigidity, social skills), and a total autistic trait score. Sex stratified PGS analyses were also performed. At the genome-wide level, ASD was positively correlated with allergic diseases (ALG), and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (FDR-p\u003c0.02). At the local genetic level, ASD was correlated with RA, C reactive protein, and granulocytes and lymphocyte counts (p\u003c0.002). In the general population sample, increased genetic liability for SLE, RA, ALG, and lymphocyte levels, captured by PGS, was associated with the total autistic score and with rigidity and childhood behaviour (FDR p=0.03). In conclusion, we demonstrated a genetic relationship between ASD and immunity that depends on the type of immune phenotype considered; some increase likelihood whereas others may potentially help build resilience. Also, this relationship may be restricted to specific genetic loci and link to specific autistic dimensions (e.g., rigidity).\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana. Aim The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD. Results The GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs. Conclusion COVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{&#43;/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{&#43;/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Brocas area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Feasibility test a co-developed intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to support psychological adjustment post-stroke, delivered by a workforce with community in-reach. Design: Observational feasibility study utilising Patient, Carer, Public Involvement (PCPI). Setting: Online. UK. Participants: Stroke survivors with self-reported psychological distress 4&#43; months post-stroke Interventions: The co-developed Wellbeing After Stroke (WAterS) intervention includes: nine weekly, structured, online, group sessions for stroke survivors, delivered via a training programme to upskill staff without previous ACT experience, under Clinical Psychology supervision. Main measures: Feasibility of recruitment and retention; data quality from candidate measures; safety. Clinical and demographic information at baseline; Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) via online surveys (baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 3 and 6 months after intervention end) including Mood (HADS), Wellbeing (ONS4), Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ5D5L), Psychological Flexibility (AAQ-ABI) and Values-Based Living (VQ). Results: We trained eight staff and recruited 17 stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate cognitive and communication difficulties. 12/17 (71%) joined three intervention groups with 98% attendance and no related adverse events. PROMS data were well-completed. The HADS is a possible future primary outcome (self-reported depression lower on average by 1.3 points: 8.5 pre-group to 7.1 at 3 month follow up; 95% CI 0.4 to 3.2). Conclusion: The WAterS intervention warrants further research evaluation. Staff can be trained and upskilled to deliver. It appears safe and feasible to deliver online to groups, and study recruitment and data collection are feasible. Funding has been secured to further develop the intervention, considering implementation and health equality.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B.

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof.

ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801.

ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that frequently persists into adulthood. Adults with ADHD often have unmet needs including experiencing high rates of substance use disorders, incarceration, and unemployment. Despite having unmet needs, there is little research on how adults with ADHD conceptualize their condition and how they believe the care they receive could be improved. We aimed to better understand what adults with ADHD would like the medical community to know about what it is like to live with ADHD and to characterize possible misconceptions of ADHD they would like to see addressed.

MethodNine online focus groups involving young adults (aged 18-35 years, N = 43) recruited from online communities for people with ADHD were conducted. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework.

ResultsIndividually, participants reported wanting increased support, education, and rejection of stigma. Structurally, participants reported desiring ADHD to be reframed as a difference as opposed to a disorder, viewing of ADHD as a mismatch with their environments, and wanting the condition to be viewed through the lens of what it is like to embody the condition.

ConclusionsIncorporating patient-lived experiences into psychiatric diagnoses may increase diagnostic patient-centeredness and help healthcare providers better meet patient needs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established.

We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria).

Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms.

Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common and complex neurodevelopmental condition. The pathophysiology of ASD is poorly defined; however, it includes a strong genetic component and there is increasing evidence to support a role of immune dysregulation. Nonetheless, it is unclear which immune phenotypes link to ASD through genetics. Hence, we investigated the genetic correlation between ASD and diverse classes of immune conditions and markers; and if these immune related genetic factors link to specific autistic like traits in the population. We estimated global and local genetic correlations between ASD (n=55,420) and 11 immune phenotypes (N &gt; 700,000) using genome-wide association study summary statistics. Subsequently, polygenic scores (PGS) for these immune phenotypes were calculated in a population-based sample (n=2,487) and associated to five autistic like traits (i.e., attention to detail, childhood behaviour, imagination, rigidity, social skills), and a total autistic trait score. Sex stratified PGS analyses were also performed. At the genome-wide level, ASD was positively correlated with allergic diseases (ALG), and negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (FDR-p&lt;0.02). At the local genetic level, ASD was correlated with RA, C reactive protein, and granulocytes and lymphocyte counts (p&lt;0.002). In the general population sample, increased genetic liability for SLE, RA, ALG, and lymphocyte levels, captured by PGS, was associated with the total autistic score and with rigidity and childhood behaviour (FDR p=0.03). In conclusion, we demonstrated a genetic relationship between ASD and immunity that depends on the type of immune phenotype considered; some increase likelihood whereas others may potentially help build resilience. Also, this relationship may be restricted to specific genetic loci and link to specific autistic dimensions (e.g., rigidity).</p>
