G.; Raznahan, A.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293881\nLarge biobanks have dramatically advanced our understanding of genetic influences on human brain anatomy. However, most studies have combined rather than compared males and females - despite theoretical grounds for potential sex differences. By systematically screening for sex differences in the common genetic architecture of \u003e 1000 neuroanatomical phenotypes in the UK Biobank, we establish a general concordance between males and females in heritability estimates, genetic correlations and variant-level effects. Notable exceptions include: higher mean h2 in females for regional volume and surface area phenotypes; between-sex genetic correlations that are significantly below 1 in the insula and parietal cortex; and, a male-specific effect common variant mapping to RBFOX1 - a gene linked to multiple male-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. This work suggests that common variant influences on human brain anatomy are largely consistent between males and females, with a few exceptions that will guide future research as biobanks continue to grow in size.\nPrediction of depressive symptoms based on sleep quality, anxiety, and brain structure\nAuthors: Olfati, M.; Samea, F.; Faghihroohi, S.; Maleki Balajoo, S.; Genon, S.; Patil, K.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293887\nBackgroundDepressive symptoms are rising in the general population and can lead to depression years later, but the contributing factors are less known. Although the link between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms has been reported, the predictive role of sleep on depressive symptoms severity (DSS) and the impact of anxiety and brain structure on their interrelationship at the individual subject level remain poorly understood. MethodsHere, we used 1813 participants from three population-based datasets. We applied ensemble machine learning models to assess the predictive role of sleep, anxiety, and brain structure on DSS in the primary dataset (n = 1101), then we tested the generalizability of our findings in two independent datasets. In addition, we performed a mediation analysis to identify the effect of anxiety and brain structure on the link between sleep and DSS. ResultsWe observed that sleep quality could predict DSS (r = 0.43, rMSE = 2.73, R2 = 0.18), and adding anxiety strengthened its prediction (r = 0.67, rMSE = 2.25, R2 = 0.45). However, brain structure (alone or along with sleep/anxiety) did not predict DSS. Importantly, out-of-cohort validations of our findings in other samples provided similar findings. Further, anxiety scores (not brain structure) could mediate the link between sleep quality and DSS. ConclusionTaken together, poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms could predict DSS across three cohorts. We hope that our findings incentivize clinicians to consider the importance of screening and treating subjects with sleep and anxiety problems to reduce the burden of depressive symptoms.\nEffect of Daytime Nap on Attention, Working Memory, and Recognition Memory\nAuthors: Zare, S.; Dortaj, F.; Setareh, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294066\nDaytime napping has gained attention for its potential to enhance cognitive functions. While the positive impact of nocturnal sleep on cognitive functions is widely acknowledged, limited research has focused on the effects of daytime naps. In this study, we investigated the influence of a 30-minute afternoon nap on cognitive functions in healthy adults. Ten participants (4 females) were involved in both nap and non-nap (control) conditions. Participants were randomly selected from the sleep department of Zare Hospital. During the nap condition, participants engaged in a 30-minute nap at approximately 14:00. Cognitive assessments were performed 30 minutes after the nap to reduce the effects of sleep inertia. Three days after nap condition, cognitive evaluations were conducted again at approximately 15:00, in the non-nap condition. Working memory, evaluated using the Backward Digit Span Task using a paired sample t-test, exhibited significant improvement during napping (p = 0.0164, d = 0.459), highlighting its practical significance. Attention, assessed with the Stroop test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significant differences between nap and non-nap conditions, emphasizing nappings role in sustaining attention and alertness. Recognition memory, gauged through the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, revealed superior performance in the nap condition, particularly in False Alarm scores. Despite limitations such as sample size and nap monitoring, our study contributes valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of daytime napping. By refining our understanding of nappings effects, tailored interventions can be developed, promoting cognitive health and performance enhancement across various contexts.

While the positive impact of nocturnal sleep on cognitive functions is widely acknowledged, limited research has focused on the effects of daytime naps. In this study, we investigated the influence of a 30-minute afternoon nap on cognitive functions in healthy adults.

Ten participants (4 females) were involved in both nap and non-nap (control) conditions. Participants were randomly selected from the sleep department of Zare Hospital. During the nap condition, participants engaged in a 30-minute nap at approximately 14:00. Cognitive assessments were performed 30 minutes after the nap to reduce the effects of sleep inertia. Three days after nap condition, cognitive evaluations were conducted again at approximately 15:00, in the non-nap condition.

Working memory, evaluated using the Backward Digit Span Task using a paired sample t-test, exhibited significant improvement during napping (p = 0.0164, d = 0.459), highlighting its practical significance. Attention, assessed with the Stroop test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significant differences between nap and non-nap conditions, emphasizing nappings role in sustaining attention and alertness. Recognition memory, gauged through the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, revealed superior performance in the nap condition, particularly in False Alarm scores.

Despite limitations such as sample size and nap monitoring, our study contributes valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of daytime napping. By refining our understanding of nappings effects, tailored interventions can be developed, promoting cognitive health and performance enhancement across various contexts.
