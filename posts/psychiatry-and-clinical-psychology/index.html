To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients. FundingWellcome Trust (206330/Z/17/Z), NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, the Thuringer Aufbaubank (2021 FGI 0060), German Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FI 1424/2-1) and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union (ITN SmartAge, H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-859890). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\nTrait responsiveness to verbal suggestions predicts nocebo responding: A meta-analysis\nAuthors: Stein, M. V.; Heller, M.; Chapman, S.; Rubin, G. J.; Terhune, D. B.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299585\nNocebo responding involves the experience of adverse health outcomes in response to contextual cues. These deleterious responses impact numerous features of mental and physical health but are characterized by pronounced heterogeneity. Suggestion is widely recognised as a contributing factor to nocebo responding but the moderating role of trait responsiveness to verbal suggestions (suggestibility) in nocebo responding remains poorly understood. We conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42023425605) to quantitatively synthesize available research on the relationship between suggestibility and nocebo responding. Four electronic databases were searched for original studies involving both the assessment of suggestibility and symptom reports in response to an inactive stimulus. Of 7,729 search results, 10 articles presenting 13 correlations between suggestibility and nocebo responding were analysed. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a significant, albeit weak, positive correlation, r=0.21 [0.04, 0.37], between suggestibility and nocebo responses, such that more highly suggestible individuals displayed larger responses. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses demonstrated that studies of higher methodological quality, including those that maintained experimenter blinding, exhibited stronger effect sizes. These results corroborate proposals that trait responsiveness to verbal suggestions confers greater response to nocebos and warrants renewed attention to the role of suggestibility in symptom induction and perception.\nBrain-charting autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder reveals distinct and overlapping neurobiology\nAuthors: Bedford, S. A.; Lai, M.-C.; Lombardo, M. V.; Chakrabarti, B.; Ruigrok, A.; Suckling, J.; Anagnostou, E.; Lerch, J. P.; Taylor, M.; Nicolson, R.; Stelios, G.; Crosbie, J.; Schachar, R.; Kelley, E.; Jones, J.; Arnold, P. D.; Courchesne, E.; Pierce, K.; Eyler, L. T.; Campbell, K.; Carter Barnes, C.; Seidlitz, J.; Alexander-Bloch, A. F.; Bullmore, E. T.; Baron-Cohen, S.; Bethlehem, R. A.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299587\nBackground Autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions with complex underlying neurobiology. Despite overlapping presentation and sex-biased prevalence, autism and ADHD are rarely studied together, and sex differences are often overlooked. Normative modelling provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in neurodivergent brain development. Methods Here we use normative modelling and a large, multi-site neuroimaging dataset to characterise cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of typical brain development based on a sample of over 75,000 individuals. We also examined sex and age differences, relationship with autistic traits, and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD (autism+ADHD). Results We observed robust neuroanatomical signatures of both autism and ADHD. Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localised to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global effects of cortical thickness increases but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The autism+ADHD group displayed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness, and certain decreases in surface area. We also found evidence that sex modulates the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only. Conclusions These results indicate distinct cortical differences in autism and ADHD that are differentially impacted by age, sex, and potentially unique patterns related to their co-occurrence.\nSocioeconomic Status and Depression - A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Jespersen, A.; Madden, R.; Whalley, H.; Reynolds, R.; Lawrie, S. M.; McIntosh, A. M.; Iveson, M. H.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299380\nObjectiveLow socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with an increased risk of depression and psychiatric disorders in general. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to provide an estimate of the risk of clinical depression associated with low SES across cultures, age groups and study designs. Finally, we tested whether associations between SES and depression differed by the income of the country in which the study was conducted. MethodsA literature search across five databases returned 7,943 studies. Title, abstract and full text screening resulted in 162 included studies of which 122 were meta-analysed, 22 were included in a cross-sectional narrative review and 19 studies were included in a longitudinal narrative review. Meta-analyses were divided into risk estimates for composite SES, income, education, and employment. Sensitivity analyses based on differences in economic situation in the country of study origin were performed to investigate a possible source of between study heterogeneity. ResultsLow SES was associated with an increased risk of depression across all measures of SES. Low income was associated with the highest odds ratio for depression (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.53-2.52). Sensitivity analyses revealed no significant differences in between-study heterogeneity or risk of depression between high- and low-income economy groups. ConclusionsComparable risks of depression across economy groups suggest that income relative to your peers, rather than absolute income, is a risk factor for depression. Preventative measures and possible policy interventions are discussed. Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis systematic review provides the largest and most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the association between socioeconomic status and depression. C_LIO_LIThe included studies span a broad range of ages, cultures, and country economies, allowing for better generalisation of the results. C_LIO_LIThe inclusion of component parts of socioeconomic status (income, education, and employment) in the meta-analysis allows for comparisons of the different risk estimates. C_LIO_LIThe broad inclusion criteria are likely to allow for increased between-study heterogeneity. C_LIO_LIDue to the observational nature of the studies included it is difficult to make conclusions on the direction of causality between socioeconomic status and depression. However, the inclusion of a longitudinal narrative review may give an indication of a direction of causality.

F.; Marquand, A. F.; Leow, A.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.23299169\nWhile digital phenotyping provides opportunities for unobtrusive, real-time mental health assessments, the integration of its modalities is not trivial due to high dimensionalities and discrepancies in sampling frequencies. We provide an integrated pipeline that solves these issues by transforming all modalities to the same time unit, applying temporal independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional modalities, and fusing the modalities with linear mixed-effects models. We applied our approach to integrate high-quality, daily self-report data with BiAffect keyboard dynamics derived from a clinical suicidality sample of mental health outpatients. Applying the ICA to the self-report data (104 participants, 5712 days of data) revealed components related to well-being, anhedonia, and irritability and social dysfunction. Mixed-effects models (55 participants, 1794 days) showed that less phone movement while typing was associated with more anhedonia ({beta} = -0.12, p = 0.00030). We consider this method to be widely applicable to dense, longitudinal digital phenotyping data.\nUnraveling the metabolomic architecture of autism in a large Danish population-based cohort\nAuthors: Ottosson, F.; Russo, F.; Abrahamsson, A.; MacSween, N.; Courraud, J.; Skogstrand, K.; Melander, O.; Ericson, U.; Orho-Melander, M.; Cohen, A. S.; Grove, J.; Mortensen, P. B.; Hougaard, D.; Ernst, M.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23298767\nThe prevalence of autism in Denmark has been increasing, reaching 1.65% among 10-year-old children and similar trends are seen elsewhere. Although there are several factors associated with autism, including genetic, environmental and prenatal factors, the molecular etiology of autism is largely unknown. Metabolomics has emerged as a tool to measure small molecules that reflect genetic, gut microbiome and dietary intake variations. Here, we apply untargeted metabolomics to over 1400 neonatal dried bloods spots, including neonates who later are diagnosed with autism and matching controls. Overall, we detect underlying molecular perturbations that precede autism related to metabolism of amino acids, acylcarnitines and peptides. In particular the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-leucine-proline and the carnitine-related 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB), were associated with an increased probability for autism. Analysis of genetic and dietary data in over 7000 adults revealed that 5-AVAB was associated with increased habitual dietary intake of dairy and with variants SLC22A5, coding for a transmembrane carnitine transporter protein involved in controlling intracellular carnitine levels. We identify 5-AVAB as a novel and potentially modifiable early biomarker for autism that may influence carnitine homeostasis.\nCortical signatures of sleep are altered following effective deep brain stimulation for depression\nAuthors: van Rheede, J. J.; Alagapan, S.; Denison, T. J.; Riva-Posse, P.; Rozell, C. J.; Mayberg, H. S.; Waters, A. C.; Sharott, A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.23299724\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is an experimental therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Chronic SCC DBS leads to long-term changes in the electrophysiological dynamics measured from local field potential (LFP) during wakefulness, but it is unclear how it impacts sleep-related brain activity. This is a crucial gap in knowledge, given the link between depression and sleep disturbances, and an emerging interest in the interaction between DBS, sleep, and circadian rhythms. We therefore sought to characterise changes in electrophysiological markers of sleep associated with DBS treat-ment for depression. We analysed key electrophysiological signatures of sleep - slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4.5Hz) and sleep spindles - in LFPs recorded from the SCC of 9 patients who responded to DBS for TRD. This allowed us to compare the electrophysiological changes before and after 24 weeks of therapeutically effective SCC DBS. SWA power was highly correlated between hemispheres, consistent with a global sleep state. Furthermore, SWA occurred earlier in the night after chronic DBS and had a more prominent peak. While we found no evidence for changes to slow wave power or stability, we found an increase in the density of sleep spindles. Our results represent a first-of-its-kind report on long-term electrophysiological markers of sleep recorded from the SCC in patients with TRD, and provides evidence of earlier NREM sleep and increased sleep spindle activity following clinically effective DBS treatment. Future work is needed to establish the causal relationship between long-term DBS and the neural mechanisms underlying sleep.\nThe pleiotropic architecture of human impulsivity across biological scales\nAuthors: Mallard, T. T.; Tubbs, J. D.; Jennings, M.; Zhang, Y.; Gustavson, D. E.; Grotzinger, A. D.; Westwater, M. L.; Williams, C. M.; Fortgang, R. G.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Elson, S. L.; Fontanillas, P.; Davis, L. K.; Raznahan, A.; Tucker-Drob, E. M.; Choi, K. W.; Ge, T.; Smoller, J. W.; Palmer, A. A.; Sanchez-Roige, S.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299133\nImpulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nocebo responding involves the experience of adverse health outcomes in response to contextual cues. These deleterious responses impact numerous features of mental and physical health but are characterized by pronounced heterogeneity. Suggestion is widely recognised as a contributing factor to nocebo responding but the moderating role of trait responsiveness to verbal suggestions (suggestibility) in nocebo responding remains poorly understood. We conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42023425605) to quantitatively synthesize available research on the relationship between suggestibility and nocebo responding. Four electronic databases were searched for original studies involving both the assessment of suggestibility and symptom reports in response to an inactive stimulus. Of 7,729 search results, 10 articles presenting 13 correlations between suggestibility and nocebo responding were analysed. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a significant, albeit weak, positive correlation, r=0.21 [0.04, 0.37], between suggestibility and nocebo responses, such that more highly suggestible individuals displayed larger responses. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses demonstrated that studies of higher methodological quality, including those that maintained experimenter blinding, exhibited stronger effect sizes. These results corroborate proposals that trait responsiveness to verbal suggestions confers greater response to nocebos and warrants renewed attention to the role of suggestibility in symptom induction and perception.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions with complex underlying neurobiology. Despite overlapping presentation and sex-biased prevalence, autism and ADHD are rarely studied together, and sex differences are often overlooked. Normative modelling provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in neurodivergent brain development. Methods Here we use normative modelling and a large, multi-site neuroimaging dataset to characterise cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of typical brain development based on a sample of over 75,000 individuals. We also examined sex and age differences, relationship with autistic traits, and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD (autism&#43;ADHD). Results We observed robust neuroanatomical signatures of both autism and ADHD. Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localised to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global effects of cortical thickness increases but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The autism&#43;ADHD group displayed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness, and certain decreases in surface area. We also found evidence that sex modulates the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only. Conclusions These results indicate distinct cortical differences in autism and ADHD that are differentially impacted by age, sex, and potentially unique patterns related to their co-occurrence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveLow socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with an increased risk of depression and psychiatric disorders in general. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to provide an estimate of the risk of clinical depression associated with low SES across cultures, age groups and study designs. Finally, we tested whether associations between SES and depression differed by the income of the country in which the study was conducted.

MethodsA literature search across five databases returned 7,943 studies. Title, abstract and full text screening resulted in 162 included studies of which 122 were meta-analysed, 22 were included in a cross-sectional narrative review and 19 studies were included in a longitudinal narrative review. Meta-analyses were divided into risk estimates for composite SES, income, education, and employment. Sensitivity analyses based on differences in economic situation in the country of study origin were performed to investigate a possible source of between study heterogeneity.

ResultsLow SES was associated with an increased risk of depression across all measures of SES. Low income was associated with the highest odds ratio for depression (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.53-2.52). Sensitivity analyses revealed no significant differences in between-study heterogeneity or risk of depression between high- and low-income economy groups.

ConclusionsComparable risks of depression across economy groups suggest that income relative to your peers, rather than absolute income, is a risk factor for depression. Preventative measures and possible policy interventions are discussed.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis systematic review provides the largest and most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the association between socioeconomic status and depression.
C_LIO_LIThe included studies span a broad range of ages, cultures, and country economies, allowing for better generalisation of the results.
C_LIO_LIThe inclusion of component parts of socioeconomic status (income, education, and employment) in the meta-analysis allows for comparisons of the different risk estimates.
C_LIO_LIThe broad inclusion criteria are likely to allow for increased between-study heterogeneity.
C_LIO_LIDue to the observational nature of the studies included it is difficult to make conclusions on the direction of causality between socioeconomic status and depression. However, the inclusion of a longitudinal narrative review may give an indication of a direction of causality.

        <p class="abstract">While digital phenotyping provides opportunities for unobtrusive, real-time mental health assessments, the integration of its modalities is not trivial due to high dimensionalities and discrepancies in sampling frequencies. We provide an integrated pipeline that solves these issues by transforming all modalities to the same time unit, applying temporal independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional modalities, and fusing the modalities with linear mixed-effects models. We applied our approach to integrate high-quality, daily self-report data with BiAffect keyboard dynamics derived from a clinical suicidality sample of mental health outpatients. Applying the ICA to the self-report data (104 participants, 5712 days of data) revealed components related to well-being, anhedonia, and irritability and social dysfunction. Mixed-effects models (55 participants, 1794 days) showed that less phone movement while typing was associated with more anhedonia ({beta} = -0.12, p = 0.00030). We consider this method to be widely applicable to dense, longitudinal digital phenotyping data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The prevalence of autism in Denmark has been increasing, reaching 1.65% among 10-year-old children and similar trends are seen elsewhere. Although there are several factors associated with autism, including genetic, environmental and prenatal factors, the molecular etiology of autism is largely unknown. Metabolomics has emerged as a tool to measure small molecules that reflect genetic, gut microbiome and dietary intake variations. Here, we apply untargeted metabolomics to over 1400 neonatal dried bloods spots, including neonates who later are diagnosed with autism and matching controls. Overall, we detect underlying molecular perturbations that precede autism related to metabolism of amino acids, acylcarnitines and peptides. In particular the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-leucine-proline and the carnitine-related 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB), were associated with an increased probability for autism. Analysis of genetic and dietary data in over 7000 adults revealed that 5-AVAB was associated with increased habitual dietary intake of dairy and with variants SLC22A5, coding for a transmembrane carnitine transporter protein involved in controlling intracellular carnitine levels. We identify 5-AVAB as a novel and potentially modifiable early biomarker for autism that may influence carnitine homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is an experimental therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Chronic SCC DBS leads to long-term changes in the electrophysiological dynamics measured from local field potential (LFP) during wakefulness, but it is unclear how it impacts sleep-related brain activity. This is a crucial gap in knowledge, given the link between depression and sleep disturbances, and an emerging interest in the interaction between DBS, sleep, and circadian rhythms. We therefore sought to characterise changes in electrophysiological markers of sleep associated with DBS treat-ment for depression. We analysed key electrophysiological signatures of sleep - slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.5-4.5Hz) and sleep spindles - in LFPs recorded from the SCC of 9 patients who responded to DBS for TRD. This allowed us to compare the electrophysiological changes before and after 24 weeks of therapeutically effective SCC DBS. SWA power was highly correlated between hemispheres, consistent with a global sleep state. Furthermore, SWA occurred earlier in the night after chronic DBS and had a more prominent peak. While we found no evidence for changes to slow wave power or stability, we found an increase in the density of sleep spindles. Our results represent a first-of-its-kind report on long-term electrophysiological markers of sleep recorded from the SCC in patients with TRD, and provides evidence of earlier NREM sleep and increased sleep spindle activity following clinically effective DBS treatment. Future work is needed to establish the causal relationship between long-term DBS and the neural mechanisms underlying sleep.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Impulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.</p>
