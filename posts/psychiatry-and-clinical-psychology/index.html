A.; Miller, A. P.; Gorelik, A. J.; Paul, S. E.; Hatoum, A. S.; Johnson, E. C.; Colbert, S. M. C.; Smyser, C. D.; Rogers, C. E.; Bijsterbosch, J. D.; Agrawal, A.; Bogdan, R.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295792\nPrenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) is associated with mental health problems, but the neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. We find that PCE is associated with localized differences across neuroimaging metrics that longitudinally mediate associations with mental health in adolescence (n=9,322-10,186). Differences in brain development may contribute to PCE-related variability in adolescent mental health.\nAssociation Patterns of Antisocial Personality Disorder across Substance Use Disorders\nAuthors: Low, A.; Stiltner, B.; Nunez, Y.; Adhikari, K.; Deak, J. D.; Pietrzak, R.; Kranzler, H.; Gelernter, J.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.23295625\nThere is a high prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in individuals affected by substance use disorders (SUD). However, there is limited information on the specific patterns of association of ASPD with SUD severity and specific SUD diagnostic criteria. We investigated the association of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, opioid, and tobacco use disorders (AUD, CanUD, CocUD, OUD, and TUD, respectively) in 1,660 individuals with ASPD and 6,640 controls matched by sex (24% female), age, and racial/ethnic background in a sample ascertained for addiction-related traits. Generalized linear regressions were used to test the association of ASPD with the five DSM-5 SUD diagnoses, their severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe), and their individual diagnostic criteria. We found that ASPD is associated with the diagnosis and severity of AUD (Odds Ratio, ORs=1.89 and 1.25), CanUD (ORs=2.13 and 1.32), and TUD (ORs=1.50 and 1.21) (ps\u003c.003). Of the specific diagnostic criteria, the \"hazardous use\" criterion showed the strongest association with ASPD across the five SUDs investigated (from ORTUD=1.88 to ORCanUD=1.37). However, when criteria of different SUDs were included in the same model, ASPD was independently associated only with TUD \"hazardous use\" and CocUD \"attempts to quit\". Attempting to quit cocaine was inversely related to the presence of ASPD and remained significant (OR=0.57, 95% confidence interval = 0.36-0.89) after controlling for interactive effects with sex. The current work provides novel insights into how different SUDs, their severity, and their diagnostic criteria associate with ASPD, potentially furthering our understanding of the impact of polysubstance addiction on mental health.\nSocial media use and internalising symptoms in clinical and community adolescent samples: A systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Fassi, L.; Thomas, K.; Parry, D. A.; Leyland-Craggs, A.; Ford, T.; Orben, A.\nScore: 18.3, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295355\nImportanceThere are many concerns about the link between social media use and adolescent mental health. However, most research has studied adolescents from the general population, overlooking clinical groups. To address this gap, we synthesize, quantify and compare evidence on the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms in adolescent clinical and community samples. Data SourcesWe searched five electronic databases for peer-reviewed publications (MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus) and preprints (Europe PMC) published in English between 2007 and 2022. Study SelectionWe included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies quantifying the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms, excluding experimental studies and randomised controlled trials. Two blinded reviewers initially identified 7389 studies. Data Extraction and SynthesisWe adhered to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for selection and reporting. The data was pooled using a random-effect model and robust variance estimation. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of evidence with the Quality of Survey Studies in Psychology Checklist. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe preregistered our hypotheses and primary study outcomes on PROSPERO (CRD42022321473). Articles were included if they reported at least one quantitative measure of a) social media use: time spent, active vs. passive use, activity, content, user perception, and other; and b) internalising symptoms: anxiety, depression or both. ResultsWe reviewed 127 studies including 1,061,293 adolescents and 775 effect sizes, of which only 8% examined clinical samples. In these samples, we found a positive, significant yet small meta-correlation between social media use and internalising symptoms, both for time spent (N = 2893, r = .08, 95% CI = [.01, .15], p = .033, I2 = 57.83) and user engagement (N = 859; r = .12, 95% CI = [.09, .15], p = .002, I2 = 82.67). These associations mirrored those in community samples. Conclusions and RelevanceWe highlight a lack of research on clinical populations, a critical gap considering that public concerns centre on the increase in youth mental health symptoms at clinical levels. This paucity of evidence not only restricts the generalizability of existing research but also hinders our ability to effectively evaluate and compare the link between social media use and youth mental health.\nThe relationship between screen-based behaviors and adolescent mental health: a phenotypic and genetic analysis\nAuthors: Frei, E.; Jaholkowski, P. P.; Parekh, P.; Frei, O.; Shadrin, A. A.; Refsum Bakken, N.; Birkenaes, V.; Ask, H.; Andreassen, O. A.; Smeland, O. B.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295537\nObjectiveTechnological advances made screen devices readily available, with adolescents spending an increasing amount of time on screens. Despite rising concerns, evidence on the relationship between screen-based activities and adolescent mental health remains inconsistent. MethodUsing self-reports from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study and ICD-10 codes for mental illness from health registries, we estimated the odds of psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents across different levels of screen usage (n = 22,096). Additionally, we computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), major depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) for adolescents without a history of mental illness and evaluated their association with time spent on screen-based activities. ResultsWe observed higher odds of psychiatric diagnoses among individuals with most time spent across all screen-based behaviors. However, the lowest social media usage was also associated with mental illness (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.80, 2.65), particularly with increased ASD occurrence. Minimum time spent on gaming was associated with lower odds of psychiatric diagnoses (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.84). PRSADHD was positively associated with time spent on social media and gaming, while PRSASD was positively associated with gaming, but negatively - with social media usage. Additionally, social media usage was significantly associated with lower PRSSCZ and PRSBP, but higher PRSAUD. ConclusionWe show that screen time behaviors are associated with mental illness among adolescents, which may partly reflect a shared genetic basis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThere are many concerns about the link between social media use and adolescent mental health. However, most research has studied adolescents from the general population, overlooking clinical groups. To address this gap, we synthesize, quantify and compare evidence on the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms in adolescent clinical and community samples.

Data SourcesWe searched five electronic databases for peer-reviewed publications (MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus) and preprints (Europe PMC) published in English between 2007 and 2022.

Study SelectionWe included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies quantifying the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms, excluding experimental studies and randomised controlled trials. Two blinded reviewers initially identified 7389 studies.

Data Extraction and SynthesisWe adhered to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for selection and reporting. The data was pooled using a random-effect model and robust variance estimation. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of evidence with the Quality of Survey Studies in Psychology Checklist.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe preregistered our hypotheses and primary study outcomes on PROSPERO (CRD42022321473). Articles were included if they reported at least one quantitative measure of a) social media use: time spent, active vs. passive use, activity, content, user perception, and other; and b) internalising symptoms: anxiety, depression or both.

ResultsWe reviewed 127 studies including 1,061,293 adolescents and 775 effect sizes, of which only 8% examined clinical samples. In these samples, we found a positive, significant yet small meta-correlation between social media use and internalising symptoms, both for time spent (N = 2893, r = .08, 95% CI = [.01, .15], p = .033, I2 = 57.83) and user engagement (N = 859; r = .12, 95% CI = [.09, .15], p = .002, I2 = 82.67). These associations mirrored those in community samples.

Conclusions and RelevanceWe highlight a lack of research on clinical populations, a critical gap considering that public concerns centre on the increase in youth mental health symptoms at clinical levels. This paucity of evidence not only restricts the generalizability of existing research but also hinders our ability to effectively evaluate and compare the link between social media use and youth mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTechnological advances made screen devices readily available, with adolescents spending an increasing amount of time on screens. Despite rising concerns, evidence on the relationship between screen-based activities and adolescent mental health remains inconsistent.

MethodUsing self-reports from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study and ICD-10 codes for mental illness from health registries, we estimated the odds of psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents across different levels of screen usage (n = 22,096). Additionally, we computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), major depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) for adolescents without a history of mental illness and evaluated their association with time spent on screen-based activities.

ResultsWe observed higher odds of psychiatric diagnoses among individuals with most time spent across all screen-based behaviors. However, the lowest social media usage was also associated with mental illness (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.80, 2.65), particularly with increased ASD occurrence. Minimum time spent on gaming was associated with lower odds of psychiatric diagnoses (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.84). PRSADHD was positively associated with time spent on social media and gaming, while PRSASD was positively associated with gaming, but negatively - with social media usage. Additionally, social media usage was significantly associated with lower PRSSCZ and PRSBP, but higher PRSAUD.

ConclusionWe show that screen time behaviors are associated with mental illness among adolescents, which may partly reflect a shared genetic basis.</p>
