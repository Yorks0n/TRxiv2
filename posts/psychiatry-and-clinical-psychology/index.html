M.; Nandru, R.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294230\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD. Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment. Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded. Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form. ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce. ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

S. M.; Ward, E.; Short, E.; Stanton, B. R.; Reinders, A. A. T. S.; Winston, J. S.; Nicholson, T. R.; Edwards, M. J.; Goldstein, L. H.; David, A. S.; Chalder, T.; Hotopf, M.; Mehta, M. A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294462\nBackgroundDifferences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored. MethodsIndividuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (\"Watch\") or detaching themselves (\"Distance\"). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously. ResultsFNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, {eta}p2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, {eta}p2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, {eta}p2: \u003c0.001-0.015). ConclusionsEmotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.\nComorbidity Profiles of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Across the Medical Phenome\nAuthors: Hicks, E. M.; Niarchou, M.; Goleva, S.; Kabir, D.; Ciarcia, J.; PTSD \u0026 Trauma EHR Working Group, ; Smoller, J.; Davis, L.; Nievergelt, C.; Koenen, K.; Huckins, L. M.; Choi, K. W.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294572\nBackground: Prior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex. Methods: PTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1+ PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2+ PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression. Results: A substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.\nModeling brain sex in the limbic system as phenotype for female-prevalent mental disorders\nAuthors: Matte Bon, G.; Kraft, D.; Comasco, E.; Derntl, B.; Kaufmann, T.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294165\nBackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics. MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample. ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model. ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders. HighlightsO_LIWe assessed sex differences and heritability of limbic and non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LILimbic volumes showed stronger sex differences and higher heritability overall. C_LIO_LIWe trained brain sex classification models on limbic or non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LIPerformance was high and the sex class probabilities were heritable for all models. C_LIO_LIIn females, limbic estimates were associated with depression diagnosis. C_LI Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.\nPredicting the onset of internalizing disorders in early adolescence using deep learning optimized with AI\nAuthors: de Lacy, N.; Ramshaw, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294377\nInternalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder) are among the most common mental health conditions that can substantially reduce daily life function. Early adolescence is an important developmental stage for the increase in prevalence of internalizing disorders and understanding specific factors that predict their onset may be germane to intervention and prevention strategies. We analyzed [~]6,000 candidate predictors from multiple knowledge domains (cognitive, psychosocial, neural, biological) contributed by children of late elementary school age (9-10 yrs) and their parents in the ABCD cohort to construct individual-level models predicting the later (11-12 yrs) onset of depression, anxiety and somatic symptom disorder using deep learning with artificial neural networks. Deep learning was guided by an evolutionary algorithm that jointly performed optimization across hyperparameters and automated feature selection, allowing more candidate predictors and a wider variety of predictor types to be analyzed than the largest previous comparable machine learning studies. We found that the future onset of internalizing disorders could be robustly predicted in early adolescence with AUROCs [\u0026ge;][~]0.90 and [\u0026ge;][~]80% accuracy. Each disorder had a specific set of predictors, though parent problem behavioral traits and sleep disturbances represented cross-cutting themes. Additional computational experiments revealed that psychosocial predictors were more important to predicting early adolescent internalizing disorders than cognitive, neural or biological factors and generated models with better performance. We also observed that the accuracy of individual-level models was highly correlated to the relative importance of their constituent predictors, suggesting that principled searches for predictors with higher importance or effect sizes could support the construction of more accurate individual-level models of internalizing disorders. Future work, including replication in additional datasets, will help test the generalizability of our findings and explore their application to other stages in human development and mental health conditions.\nMDMA Assisted Psychotherapy Decreases PTSD Symptoms, Dissociation, Functional Disability, and Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Green, W. M.; Raut, S. B.; James, F. L. J.; Benedek, D. M.; Ursano, R. J.; Johnson, L. R.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23293955\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.\nUsability and Accuracy of the SWIFT-ActiveScreener Preliminary evaluation for use in clinical research\nAuthors: Liu, J. W.; Ein, N.; Gervasio, J.; Easterbrook, B.; Nouri, M. S.; Nazarov, A.; Richardson, J. D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294573\nSystematic reviews (SRs) employ standardized methodological processes for synthesizing empirical evidence to answer specific research questions. These processes include rigorous screening phases to determine eligibility of articles against strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite these processes, SRs are a significant undertaking, and this type of research often necessitates extensive human resource requirements, especially when the scope of the review is large. Given the substantial resources and time commitment required, we investigated a way in which the screening process might be accelerated while maintaining high fidelity and adherence to SR processes. More recently, researchers have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence-based (AI) software to expedite the screening process. This paper evaluated the accuracy and usabiity of a novel, machine learning program, Sciome SWIFT-ActiveScreener (ActiveScreener) in a large SR of mental health outcomes following treatment for PTSD. ActiveScreener exceeded the expected 95% accuracy of the program to predict inclusion or exclusion of relevant articles, and was reported to be user friendly by both novice and seasoned screeners. Our results showed that ActiveScreener, when used appropriately, may save considerable time and human resources when performing SR.\nRemote monitoring of depression severity: A machine learning approach\nAuthors: Holstein, V. L.; Rahimi-Eichi, H.; Emden, D.; Gutfleisch, L.; Refisch, A.; Goltermann, J.; Leenings, R.; Winter, N. R.; Kircher, T.; Nenadic, I.; Redlich, R.; Leehr, E. J.; Dohm, K.; Baker, J. T.; Dannlowski, U.; Opel, N.; Hahn, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294431\nDepression is a widely prevalent psychiatric illness with variable levels of severity that necessitate different approaches to treatment. To enhance the management of this condition, there is a growing interest in utilizing mobile devices, especially smartphones, for remote monitoring of patients. This study aims to build prediction models for depression severity based on active and passive features collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of depression severity. Using data from 142 participants (85 healthy controls, 67 MDD) we extracted features such as GPS-derived mobility markers, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), age, and sex to develop machine learning models of depression severity on the different diagnostic subgroups in this cohort. Our results indicate that the employed models outperformed baseline estimators in random split scenarios. However, the improvement was marginal in user-split scenarios, highlighting the need for larger and more diverse samples for clinical utility. Among the features, mood EMA emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by GPS-derived mobility features. Models also showed a significant association between depression severity and average reported mood, as well as GPS-derived mobility markers such as number of places visited and percent home. While predicting composite depression scores is important, future studies could explore predicting individual symptom items or symptom groups for a more comprehensive assessment of depression severity. Challenges for clinical utility include participant dropout, which could be addressed through more engaging app design to promote user adherence. Harmonization of phone-derived measures is also crucial to facilitate model transfer across studies. In conclusion, this study contributes valuable evidence supporting the potential utility of smartphone data for mood state monitoring and predicting depression severity. Future research should focus on predicting depression further ahead in time and addressing the challenges identified to create more robust and effective depression monitoring solutions using smartphone-based data.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD.

Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment.

Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form.

ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce.

ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDifferences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored.

MethodsIndividuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (&#34;Watch&#34;) or detaching themselves (&#34;Distance&#34;). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously.

ResultsFNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, {eta}p2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, {eta}p2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, {eta}p2: &lt;0.001-0.015).

ConclusionsEmotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Prior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex. Methods: PTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1&#43; PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2&#43; PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression. Results: A substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics.

MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample.

ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model.

ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.

Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder) are among the most common mental health conditions that can substantially reduce daily life function. Early adolescence is an important developmental stage for the increase in prevalence of internalizing disorders and understanding specific factors that predict their onset may be germane to intervention and prevention strategies. We analyzed [~]6,000 candidate predictors from multiple knowledge domains (cognitive, psychosocial, neural, biological) contributed by children of late elementary school age (9-10 yrs) and their parents in the ABCD cohort to construct individual-level models predicting the later (11-12 yrs) onset of depression, anxiety and somatic symptom disorder using deep learning with artificial neural networks. Deep learning was guided by an evolutionary algorithm that jointly performed optimization across hyperparameters and automated feature selection, allowing more candidate predictors and a wider variety of predictor types to be analyzed than the largest previous comparable machine learning studies. We found that the future onset of internalizing disorders could be robustly predicted in early adolescence with AUROCs [&amp;ge;][~]0.90 and [&amp;ge;][~]80% accuracy. Each disorder had a specific set of predictors, though parent problem behavioral traits and sleep disturbances represented cross-cutting themes. Additional computational experiments revealed that psychosocial predictors were more important to predicting early adolescent internalizing disorders than cognitive, neural or biological factors and generated models with better performance. We also observed that the accuracy of individual-level models was highly correlated to the relative importance of their constituent predictors, suggesting that principled searches for predictors with higher importance or effect sizes could support the construction of more accurate individual-level models of internalizing disorders. Future work, including replication in additional datasets, will help test the generalizability of our findings and explore their application to other stages in human development and mental health conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Systematic reviews (SRs) employ standardized methodological processes for synthesizing empirical evidence to answer specific research questions. These processes include rigorous screening phases to determine eligibility of articles against strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite these processes, SRs are a significant undertaking, and this type of research often necessitates extensive human resource requirements, especially when the scope of the review is large. Given the substantial resources and time commitment required, we investigated a way in which the screening process might be accelerated while maintaining high fidelity and adherence to SR processes. More recently, researchers have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence-based (AI) software to expedite the screening process. This paper evaluated the accuracy and usabiity of a novel, machine learning program, Sciome SWIFT-ActiveScreener (ActiveScreener) in a large SR of mental health outcomes following treatment for PTSD. ActiveScreener exceeded the expected 95% accuracy of the program to predict inclusion or exclusion of relevant articles, and was reported to be user friendly by both novice and seasoned screeners. Our results showed that ActiveScreener, when used appropriately, may save considerable time and human resources when performing SR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Depression is a widely prevalent psychiatric illness with variable levels of severity that necessitate different approaches to treatment. To enhance the management of this condition, there is a growing interest in utilizing mobile devices, especially smartphones, for remote monitoring of patients. This study aims to build prediction models for depression severity based on active and passive features collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of depression severity.

Using data from 142 participants (85 healthy controls, 67 MDD) we extracted features such as GPS-derived mobility markers, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), age, and sex to develop machine learning models of depression severity on the different diagnostic subgroups in this cohort.

Our results indicate that the employed models outperformed baseline estimators in random split scenarios. However, the improvement was marginal in user-split scenarios, highlighting the need for larger and more diverse samples for clinical utility. Among the features, mood EMA emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by GPS-derived mobility features. Models also showed a significant association between depression severity and average reported mood, as well as GPS-derived mobility markers such as number of places visited and percent home.

While predicting composite depression scores is important, future studies could explore predicting individual symptom items or symptom groups for a more comprehensive assessment of depression severity. Challenges for clinical utility include participant dropout, which could be addressed through more engaging app design to promote user adherence. Harmonization of phone-derived measures is also crucial to facilitate model transfer across studies.

In conclusion, this study contributes valuable evidence supporting the potential utility of smartphone data for mood state monitoring and predicting depression severity. Future research should focus on predicting depression further ahead in time and addressing the challenges identified to create more robust and effective depression monitoring solutions using smartphone-based data.</p>
