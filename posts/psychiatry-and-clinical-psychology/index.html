Impulsivity induced by dopaminergic agents can lead to impaired social functioning and quality of life. AimThis study assesses impulsivity burdens from pramipexole and aripiprazole, pinpointing key symptoms for targeted mitigation. MethodLeveraging data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (January 2004 - March 2022), we employed the Information Component to identify the syndrome of signs and symptoms disproportionately co-reported with drug-induced impulsivity. Using composite network analyses (PPMI, Ising,{phi} ) we characterized clusters of co-reported events (i.e., subsyndromes). Finally, we assessed the secondary impact of drug-induced impulsivity modeling our dataset as a chain of directed connections (Bayesian network). ResultsThe drug-induced impulsivity syndrome (respectively 56 and 107 events in pramipexole and aripiprazole recipients), primarily encompassed psychiatric, social, and metabolic events, segregated into subsyndromes such as delusional jealousy and dopamine dysregulation syndromes among pramipexole recipients, and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and social issues among aripiprazole recipients. Anxiety and economic problems emerged as pivotal nodes in the exacerbation of the syndromes. ConclusionDrug-induced impulsivity places a substantial burden on patients and their families, with manifestations shaped by the underlying disease. Network approaches, exploring intricate symptom connections and identifying pivotal symptoms, complement traditional techniques and clinical judgment, providing a foundation for informed prescription and targeted interventions to alleviate the burden of adverse drug reactions.\nSex-stratified phenotyping of comorbidities associated with an inpatient delirium diagnosis using real world data\nAuthors: Kodama, L.; Woldemariam, S.; Tang, A.; Li, Y.; Oskotsky, T.; Raphael, E.; Sirota, M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297925\nDelirium is a heterogeneous and detrimental mental condition often seen in older, hospitalized patients and is currently hard to predict. In this study, we leverage large-scale, real- world data using the electronic health records (EHR) to identify two cohorts comprised of 7,492 UCSF patients and 19,417 UC health system patients (excluding UCSF patients) with an inpatient delirium diagnosis and the same number of propensity score-matched control patients without delirium. We found significant associations between comorbidities or laboratory test values and an inpatient delirium diagnosis which were validated independently. Most of these associations were those previously-identified as risk factors for delirium, including metabolic abnormalities, mental health diagnoses, and infections. Some of the associations were sex- specific, including those related to dementia subtypes and infections. We further explored the diagnostic associations with anemia and bipolar disorder by conducting longitudinal analyses from the time of first diagnosis of the risk factor to development of delirium demonstrating a significant relationship across time. Finally, we show that an inpatient delirium diagnosis leads to dramatic increases in mortality outcome across both cohorts. These results demonstrate the powerful application of leveraging EHR data to shed insights into prior diagnoses and laboratory test values that could help predict development of inpatient delirium and emphasize the importance of considering patient demographic characteristics including documented sex when making these assessments.

T.; Holmes, A.; Orchard, E. R.; Segal, A.; Francey, S. M.; ODonoghue, B.; Cropley, V.; Nelson, B.; Graham, J.; Baldwin, L.; Yuen, H. P.; Allott, K.; Alvarez-Jimenez, M.; Harrigan, S.; Pantelis, C.; Wood, S. J.; McGorry, P.; Fornito, A.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298391\nOBJECTIVEDisruptions of axonal connectivity are thought to be a core pathophysiological feature of psychotic illness, but whether they are present early in the illness, prior to antipsychotic exposure, and whether they can predict clinical outcome remains unknown. METHODSWe acquired diffusion-weighted MRI to map axonal connectivity between each pair of 319 parcellated brain regions in 61 antipsychotic-naive individuals with First Episode Psychosis (FEP; 15-25 years, 46% female) and a demographically matched sample of 27 control participants, along with clinical follow-up data in patients 3 months and 12 months after the scan. We used connectome-wide analyses to map disruptions of inter-regional pairwise connectivity coupled with connectome-based predictive modelling to predict longitudinal change in symptoms and functioning. RESULTSIndividuals with FEP showed disrupted connectivity in a brain-wide network linking all brain regions when compared with controls (pFWE = .03). Baseline structural connectivity significantly predicted change in functioning over 12 months (r = .44; pFWE = .041), such that lower connectivity within fronto- striato-thalamic systems predicted worse functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONSBrain-wide reductions of structural connectivity exist during the early stages of psychotic illness and cannot be attributed to antipsychotic medication. Moreover, baseline measures of structural connectivity can predict change in patient functional outcomes up to one year after engagement with treatment services.\n",

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVEDisruptions of axonal connectivity are thought to be a core pathophysiological feature of psychotic illness, but whether they are present early in the illness, prior to antipsychotic exposure, and whether they can predict clinical outcome remains unknown.

METHODSWe acquired diffusion-weighted MRI to map axonal connectivity between each pair of 319 parcellated brain regions in 61 antipsychotic-naive individuals with First Episode Psychosis (FEP; 15-25 years, 46% female) and a demographically matched sample of 27 control participants, along with clinical follow-up data in patients 3 months and 12 months after the scan. We used connectome-wide analyses to map disruptions of inter-regional pairwise connectivity coupled with connectome-based predictive modelling to predict longitudinal change in symptoms and functioning.

RESULTSIndividuals with FEP showed disrupted connectivity in a brain-wide network linking all brain regions when compared with controls (pFWE = .03). Baseline structural connectivity significantly predicted change in functioning over 12 months (r = .44; pFWE = .041), such that lower connectivity within fronto- striato-thalamic systems predicted worse functional outcomes.

CONCLUSIONSBrain-wide reductions of structural connectivity exist during the early stages of psychotic illness and cannot be attributed to antipsychotic medication. Moreover, baseline measures of structural connectivity can predict change in patient functional outcomes up to one year after engagement with treatment services.</p>
