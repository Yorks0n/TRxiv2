Hyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning.">

S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23291166\nHyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, g) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 g isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n=24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the HC group (n=24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than HC during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 g isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing according to prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.\nUsing Natural Language Processing as a Scalable Mental Status Evaluation Technique\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Jagayat, J.; Kumar, A.; Shirazi, A.; Alavi, N.; Omrani, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300047\nMental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.\nOnline cognitive behavioural therapy as an initial treatment for psychological distress in patients waiting for therapy: Study protocol\nAuthors: Guiney, H.; Mahoney, A.; Morgan, A.; Elders, A.; David, C.; Howell, Z.; Codyre, D.; Rapsey, C.; Poulton, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299986\nBackgroundWait times for mental health treatment are long. This protocol describes a trial to test whether engaging in a self-directed online cognitive behavioural therapy tool (called Just a Thought) while waiting for psychological therapy is an acceptable and effective intervention for help-seeking patients. The trial will be conducted within the context of a large psychological service in Auckland, New Zealand. MethodsIn this parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, consenting patients with at least five weeks to wait for their first therapy appointment will be randomly assigned to receive Just a Thought (intervention) or waitlist-as-usual conditions plus generic wellbeing information (control) while they wait. Mental health, general health and wellbeing, and treatment satisfaction will be measured across the first ten weeks of the trial, and at 8 months. OutcomesThe primary outcomes are the acceptability and effectiveness of Just a Thought as an initial treatment. Acceptability will be assessed as participants satisfaction, and effectiveness as change in psychological distress over time (relative to control). We hypothesise that participants will be more satisfied with Just a Thought than generic wellbeing information and that those who engage in Just a Thought will show greater reductions in psychological distress than those in the waiting-as-usual group. ConclusionsOnline cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious and has the potential to provide people experiencing psychological distress with fast access to evidence-based psychological treatment. This study will provide insight into its potential as an acceptable and effective pre-treatment for people seeking psychological help.\nGhrelin is associated with an elevated mood after an overnight fast in depression\nAuthors: Fahed, R.; Schulz, C.; Klaus, J.; Ellinger, S.; Walter, M.; Kroemer, N. B.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300133\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive. MethodsWe collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T). ResultsPatients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD. LimitationsThe study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention. ConclusionsOur results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.

Yet, consensus has not been reached on mechanisms and clinical features that underlie sex-based discrepancies. Whereas females may be under-diagnosed because of inconsistencies in diagnostic/ascertainment procedures (sex-biased criteria, social camouflaging), diagnosed males may have exhibited more overt behaviors (e.g., hyperactivity, aggression) that prompted clinical evaluation. Applying a novel network-theory-based approach, we extracted data-driven, clinically-relevant insights from a large, well-characterized sample (Simons Simplex Collection) of 2175 autistic males (Ages = 8.9{+/-}3.5 years) and 334 autistic females (Ages = 9.2{+/-}3.7 years). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and expert clinical review reduced data dimensionality to 15 factors of interest. To offset inherent confounds of an imbalanced sample, we identified a subset of males (N=331) matched to females on key variables (Age, IQ) and applied data-driven CDA using Greedy Fast Causal Inference (GFCI) for three groups (All Females, All Males, and Matched Males). Structural equation modeling (SEM) extracted measures of model fit and effect sizes for causal relationships between sex, age, and, IQ on EFA-selected factors capturing phenotypic representations of autism across sensory, social, and restricted and repetitive behavior domains. Our methodology unveiled sex-specific directional relationships to inform developmental outcomes and targeted interventions.\nCopper-deficiency is associated with impairments in social behavior and oligodendrocyte development via mTOR signaling pathway\nAuthors: Usui, N.; Doi, M.; Berto, S.; Matsuoka, K.; Ishida, R.; Irie, K.; Nakama, N.; Miyauchi, H.; Fujiwara, Y.; Yamauchi, T.; Hirai, T.; Toritsuka, M.; Xie, M.-J.; Kayashima, Y.; Umeda, N.; Iwata, K.; Okumura, K.; Harada, T.; Yoshimura, T.; Katayama, T.; Tsujii, M.; Matsuzaki, H.; Makinodan, M.; Shimada, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300061\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, however the biological mechanisms remain unclear. Although trace elements play essential roles in the living body, it is unclear how alterations of trace elements in ASD are involved in pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the plasma metallome and identified the alterations of 11 elements in individuals with ASD. The copper decrease was negatively correlated with ASD symptom scores. A copper-deficient mouse model reflecting the condition showed ASD-like behaviors and impaired oligodendrocyte development. In copper-deficient mice, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was reduced, and its activation by agonist improved social impairment and oligodendrocyte developmental defects. Supporting these results, white matter volumes were negatively correlated with social symptoms in individuals with ASD. Our results demonstrate that copper-deficiency contributes to ASD by causing oligodendrocytes impairment via mTOR signaling. Our findings indicate that the effects of copper-deficiency and mTOR imbalance are relevant to the pathogenesis of ASD and are potential therapeutic targets.\nLong COVID is associated with severe cognitive slowing\nAuthors: Zhao, S.; Martin, E. M.; Reuken, P. A.; Scholcz, A.; Ganse-Dumrath, A.; Srowig, A.; Utech, I.; Kozik, V.; Radscheidt, M.; Brodoehl, S.; Stallmach, A.; Schwab, M.; Fraser, E.; Finke, K.; Husain, M.\nScore: 554.2, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299331\nBackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients. FundingWellcome Trust (206330/Z/17/Z), NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, the Thuringer Aufbaubank (2021 FGI 0060), German Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FI 1424/2-1) and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union (ITN SmartAge, H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-859890). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Hyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, g) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 g isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n=24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the HC group (n=24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than HC during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 g isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing according to prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWait times for mental health treatment are long. This protocol describes a trial to test whether engaging in a self-directed online cognitive behavioural therapy tool (called  Just a Thought) while waiting for psychological therapy is an acceptable and effective intervention for help-seeking patients. The trial will be conducted within the context of a large psychological service in Auckland, New Zealand.

MethodsIn this parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, consenting patients with at least five weeks to wait for their first therapy appointment will be randomly assigned to receive Just a Thought (intervention) or waitlist-as-usual conditions plus generic wellbeing information (control) while they wait. Mental health, general health and wellbeing, and treatment satisfaction will be measured across the first ten weeks of the trial, and at 8 months.

OutcomesThe primary outcomes are the acceptability and effectiveness of Just a Thought as an initial treatment. Acceptability will be assessed as participants satisfaction, and effectiveness as change in psychological distress over time (relative to control). We hypothesise that participants will be more satisfied with Just a Thought than generic wellbeing information and that those who engage in Just a Thought will show greater reductions in psychological distress than those in the waiting-as-usual group.

ConclusionsOnline cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious and has the potential to provide people experiencing psychological distress with fast access to evidence-based psychological treatment. This study will provide insight into its potential as an acceptable and effective pre-treatment for people seeking psychological help.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive.

MethodsWe collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T).

ResultsPatients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD.

LimitationsThe study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention.

ConclusionsOur results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.

        <p class="abstract">Prevalence in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis has long been strongly male-biased. Yet, consensus has not been reached on mechanisms and clinical features that underlie sex-based discrepancies. Whereas females may be under-diagnosed because of inconsistencies in diagnostic/ascertainment procedures (sex-biased criteria, social camouflaging), diagnosed males may have exhibited more overt behaviors (e.g., hyperactivity, aggression) that prompted clinical evaluation. Applying a novel network-theory-based approach, we extracted data-driven, clinically-relevant insights from a large, well-characterized sample (Simons Simplex Collection) of 2175 autistic males (Ages = 8.9{&#43;/-}3.5 years) and 334 autistic females (Ages = 9.2{&#43;/-}3.7 years). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and expert clinical review reduced data dimensionality to 15 factors of interest. To offset inherent confounds of an imbalanced sample, we identified a subset of males (N=331) matched to females on key variables (Age, IQ) and applied data-driven CDA using Greedy Fast Causal Inference (GFCI) for three groups (All Females, All Males, and Matched Males). Structural equation modeling (SEM) extracted measures of model fit and effect sizes for causal relationships between sex, age, and, IQ on EFA-selected factors capturing phenotypic representations of autism across sensory, social, and restricted and repetitive behavior domains. Our methodology unveiled sex-specific directional relationships to inform developmental outcomes and targeted interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, however the biological mechanisms remain unclear. Although trace elements play essential roles in the living body, it is unclear how alterations of trace elements in ASD are involved in pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the plasma metallome and identified the alterations of 11 elements in individuals with ASD. The copper decrease was negatively correlated with ASD symptom scores. A copper-deficient mouse model reflecting the condition showed ASD-like behaviors and impaired oligodendrocyte development. In copper-deficient mice, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was reduced, and its activation by agonist improved social impairment and oligodendrocyte developmental defects. Supporting these results, white matter volumes were negatively correlated with social symptoms in individuals with ASD. Our results demonstrate that copper-deficiency contributes to ASD by causing oligodendrocytes impairment via mTOR signaling. Our findings indicate that the effects of copper-deficiency and mTOR imbalance are relevant to the pathogenesis of ASD and are potential therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>
