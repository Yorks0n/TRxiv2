However, the theory has been bolstered heavily by research on high-penetrance genetic mechanisms which are only found in a small proportion of the autism population. Thus, how well does E:I imbalance explain idiopathic autism? Here we find that idiopathic autistic males can be split into two distinct E:I-defined 'neurosubtypes'. These E:I neurosubtypes can be identified in EEG data via an E:I-sensitive metric known as the Hurst exponent (H). Half of autistic individuals fall into the first E:I neurosubtype and can be described as having elevated E:I ratio relative to typically-developing (TD) comparison group. The remaining other half of autistic males fall into a second E:I neurosubtype with the opposite pattern of reduced E:I ratio relative to TD. Finally, E:I neurosubtypes show differential relationships between H and behavioral and demographic variables consisting of age, intelligence, and autism symptomatology. This work suggests that different types of E:I imbalance can manifest in idiopathic autistic males. Such differential E:I biomarkers may be indicative of distinctive etiological or compensatory mechanisms and differential underlying micro- and macroscale neural organization with differential phenotypic impact.\nUnveiling the Hidden Toll of Drug-Induced Impulsivity: A Network Analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.\nAuthors: Fusaroli, M.; Polizzi, S.; Menestrina, L.; Giunchi, V.; Pellegrini, L.; Raschi, E.; Weintraub, D.; Recanatini, M.; Castellani, G.; De Ponti, F.; Poluzzi, E.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.23298635\nIntroductionAdverse drug reactions significantly impact patients lives, yet their influence is often underestimated in treatment decisions and monitoring. Impulsivity induced by dopaminergic agents can lead to impaired social functioning and quality of life. AimThis study assesses impulsivity burdens from pramipexole and aripiprazole, pinpointing key symptoms for targeted mitigation. MethodLeveraging data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (January 2004 - March 2022), we employed the Information Component to identify the syndrome of signs and symptoms disproportionately co-reported with drug-induced impulsivity. Using composite network analyses (PPMI, Ising,{phi} ) we characterized clusters of co-reported events (i.e., subsyndromes). Finally, we assessed the secondary impact of drug-induced impulsivity modeling our dataset as a chain of directed connections (Bayesian network). ResultsThe drug-induced impulsivity syndrome (respectively 56 and 107 events in pramipexole and aripiprazole recipients), primarily encompassed psychiatric, social, and metabolic events, segregated into subsyndromes such as delusional jealousy and dopamine dysregulation syndromes among pramipexole recipients, and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and social issues among aripiprazole recipients. Anxiety and economic problems emerged as pivotal nodes in the exacerbation of the syndromes. ConclusionDrug-induced impulsivity places a substantial burden on patients and their families, with manifestations shaped by the underlying disease. Network approaches, exploring intricate symptom connections and identifying pivotal symptoms, complement traditional techniques and clinical judgment, providing a foundation for informed prescription and targeted interventions to alleviate the burden of adverse drug reactions.\nAssociations Between Polygenic Scores for Cognitive and Non-cognitive Factors of Educational Attainment and Measures of Behavior, Psychopathology, and Neuroimaging in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\nAuthors: Gorelik, A. J.; Paul, S. E.; Miller, A. P.; Baranger, D. A.; Lin, S.; Zhang, W.; Elsayed, N. M.; Modi, H.; Addala, P.; Bijsterbosch, J. D.; Barch, D. M.; Karcher, N. R.; Hatoum, A. S.; Agrawal, A.; Bogdan, R.; Johnson, E. C.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297675\nBackgroundBoth cognitive and non-cognitive (e.g., traits like curiosity) factors are critical for social and emotional functioning and independently predict educational attainment. These factors are heritable and genetically correlated with a range of health-relevant traits and behaviors in adulthood (e.g., risk-taking, psychopathology). However, whether these associations are present during adolescence, and to what extent these relationships diverge, could have implications for adolescent health and well-being. MethodsUsing data from 5,517 youth of European ancestry from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, we examined associations between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non-cognitive factors and outcomes related to cognition, socioeconomic status, risk tolerance and decision-making, substance initiation, psychopathology, and brain structure. ResultsCognitive and non-cognitive PGSs were both positively associated with cognitive performance and family income, and negatively associated with ADHD and severity of psychotic-like experiences. The cognitive PGS was also associated with greater risk-taking, delayed discounting, and anorexia, as well as lower likelihood of nicotine initiation. The cognitive PGS was further associated with cognition scores and anorexia in within-sibling analyses, suggesting these results do not solely reflect the effects of assortative mating or passive gene-environment correlations. The cognitive PGS showed significantly stronger associations with cortical volumes than the non-cognitive PGS and was associated with right hemisphere caudal anterior cingulate and pars-orbitalis in within-sibling analyses, while the non-cognitive PGS showed stronger associations with white matter fractional anisotropy and a significant within-sibling association for right superior corticostriate-frontal cortex. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that PGSs for cognitive and non-cognitive factors show similar associations with cognition and socioeconomic status as well as other psychosocial outcomes, but distinct associations with regional neural phenotypes in this adolescent sample.\nBinary classification of English Reddit posts self-reporting a social anxiety disorder diagnosis\nAuthors: Singh, S.; Bedi, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298362\nThis paper presents the system developed by Team ThaparUni for the Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) 2023 Shared Task 4. The task involved binary classification of English Reddit posts, focusing on self-reporting social anxiety disorder (SAD) diagnoses. The final system employed a combination of three models: RoBERTa, ERNIE, and XLNet, and results obtained from all three models were integrated. The results, specifically in the context of mental health-related content analysis on social media platforms, show the possibility and viability of using multiple models in binary classification tasks.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBoth cognitive and non-cognitive (e.g., traits like curiosity) factors are critical for social and emotional functioning and independently predict educational attainment. These factors are heritable and genetically correlated with a range of health-relevant traits and behaviors in adulthood (e.g., risk-taking, psychopathology). However, whether these associations are present during adolescence, and to what extent these relationships diverge, could have implications for adolescent health and well-being.

MethodsUsing data from 5,517 youth of European ancestry from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, we examined associations between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non-cognitive factors and outcomes related to cognition, socioeconomic status, risk tolerance and decision-making, substance initiation, psychopathology, and brain structure.

ResultsCognitive and non-cognitive PGSs were both positively associated with cognitive performance and family income, and negatively associated with ADHD and severity of psychotic-like experiences. The cognitive PGS was also associated with greater risk-taking, delayed discounting, and anorexia, as well as lower likelihood of nicotine initiation. The cognitive PGS was further associated with cognition scores and anorexia in within-sibling analyses, suggesting these results do not solely reflect the effects of assortative mating or passive gene-environment correlations. The cognitive PGS showed significantly stronger associations with cortical volumes than the non-cognitive PGS and was associated with right hemisphere caudal anterior cingulate and pars-orbitalis in within-sibling analyses, while the non-cognitive PGS showed stronger associations with white matter fractional anisotropy and a significant within-sibling association for right superior corticostriate-frontal cortex.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that PGSs for cognitive and non-cognitive factors show similar associations with cognition and socioeconomic status as well as other psychosocial outcomes, but distinct associations with regional neural phenotypes in this adolescent sample.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This paper presents the system developed by Team ThaparUni for the Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) 2023 Shared Task 4. The task involved binary classification of English Reddit posts, focusing on self-reporting social anxiety disorder (SAD) diagnoses. The final system employed a combination of three models: RoBERTa, ERNIE, and XLNet, and results obtained from all three models were integrated. The results, specifically in the context of mental health-related content analysis on social media platforms, show the possibility and viability of using multiple models in binary classification tasks.</p>
