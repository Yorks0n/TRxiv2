Brandeau, M.; Shmueli, E.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300048\nThe coordinated terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023, resulted in catastrophic atrocities, and marked the beginning of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. The overwhelming coverage by mainstream and social media, characterized by extreme details and graphic images, vividly transported viewers to the horrifying scene. It remains unclear to what extent such indirect exposure influences the occurrence of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. We analyzed data from a three-year prospective study in which 4,797 participants received smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, supplemented by a nationwide clinical survey with 2,536 participants. Among the participants not directly exposed, we estimated PTSD prevalence to be 22.9-36.0% and moderate to severe anxiety prevalence to be 22.9-55.32%, with 752,057 daily questionnaires before and after October 7 further indicating higher stress levels than those reported in previous events, including political disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and past armed conflicts. The occurrences of PTSD and anxiety are well explained by increased and persistent news consumption, and especially by the availability of gory videos on social media. Continuous monitoring of participants via smartwatches and daily questionnaires further revealed considerable differences in stress, mood, step counts, sleep quality, and duration in the first week after the October 7 events among those who later developed PTSD. This study demonstrates the unprecedented amplifying effect of mass media on mental health in terror and war settings and highlights the potential of continuous monitoring for early detection and prompt treatment of those in need.\nEffects of Diazepam on Hippocampal Blood Flow in People at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis\nAuthors: Livingston, N. R.; Kiemes, A.; Devenyi, G. A.; Knight, S.; Lukow, P. B.; Jelen, L.; Reilly, T.; Dima, A.; Nettis, M. A.; Casetta, C.; Agyekum, T.; Zelaya, F.; Spencer, T.; De Micheli, A.; Fusar-Poli, P.; Grace, A. A.; Williams, S. C. R.; McGuire, P.; Egerton, A.; Chakravarty, M. M.; Modinos, G.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23299658\nBackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals. MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield. ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 24.1[{+/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 26.5[{+/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR\u003c0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR\u003c0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR\u003c0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225). ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.\nIsolating transdiagnostic effects reveals specific genetic profiles in psychiatric disorders.\nAuthors: Keser, E.; Liao, W.; Allegrini, A. G.; Rimfeld, K.; Eley, T. C.; Plomin, R.; Malanchini, M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300292\nEvidence indicates a great degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric diagnoses. Accounting for these transdiagnostic effects can sharpen research on disorder-specific genetic architecture. Here we isolate genetic effects that are shared across 11 major psychiatric disorders (p factor) to gain further insight into genetic specificity and comorbidity over and above that contributed by the p factor, unique to each psychiatric disorder. After adjusting for transdiagnostic genetic effects, we identified novel SNP associations and some changes in enrichment patterns. We examined genetic correlations among adjusted psychiatric traits as well as relationships with other biobehavioural traits. The landscape of genetic associations between pairs of psychiatric disorders changed substantially, and their genetic correlations with biobehavioural traits showed greater specificity. Isolating transdiagnostic genetic effects across major psychiatric disorders provides a nuanced understanding of disorder-specific genetic architecture and may help guide diagnostic nomenclature and treatment research.\nThe antidepressant effects of vaporized N,N-Dimethyltryptamine: a preliminary report in treatment-resistant depression\nAuthors: Falchi-Carvalho, M.; Barros, H.; Bolcont, R.; Laborde, S.; Wiessner, I.; Silva, S. R. B.; Montanini, D.; Barbosa, D.; Teixeira, E.; Florence-Vilela, R.; Almeida, R.; Macedo, R. K. A.; Arichelle, F.; J. Pantrigo, E.; Arcoverde, E.; Galvao-Coelho, N.; Araujo, D. B.; Palhano-Fontes, F.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23300610\nIntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield.

ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 24.1[{&#43;/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 26.5[{&#43;/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR&lt;0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR&lt;0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR&lt;0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225).

ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evidence indicates a great degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric diagnoses. Accounting for these transdiagnostic effects can sharpen research on disorder-specific genetic architecture. Here we isolate genetic effects that are shared across 11 major psychiatric disorders (p factor) to gain further insight into genetic specificity and comorbidity over and above that contributed by the p factor, unique to each psychiatric disorder. After adjusting for transdiagnostic genetic effects, we identified novel SNP associations and some changes in enrichment patterns. We examined genetic correlations among adjusted psychiatric traits as well as relationships with other biobehavioural traits. The landscape of genetic associations between pairs of psychiatric disorders changed substantially, and their genetic correlations with biobehavioural traits showed greater specificity. Isolating transdiagnostic genetic effects across major psychiatric disorders provides a nuanced understanding of disorder-specific genetic architecture and may help guide diagnostic nomenclature and treatment research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing.

ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission.

DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.
