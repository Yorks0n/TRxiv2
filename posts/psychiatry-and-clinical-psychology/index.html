Brandeau, M.; Shmueli, E.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300048\nThe coordinated terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023, resulted in catastrophic atrocities, and marked the beginning of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. The overwhelming coverage by mainstream and social media, characterized by extreme details and graphic images, vividly transported viewers to the horrifying scene. It remains unclear to what extent such indirect exposure influences the occurrence of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. We analyzed data from a three-year prospective study in which 4,797 participants received smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, supplemented by a nationwide clinical survey with 2,536 participants. Among the participants not directly exposed, we estimated PTSD prevalence to be 22.9-36.0% and moderate to severe anxiety prevalence to be 22.9-55.32%, with 752,057 daily questionnaires before and after October 7 further indicating higher stress levels than those reported in previous events, including political disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and past armed conflicts. The occurrences of PTSD and anxiety are well explained by increased and persistent news consumption, and especially by the availability of gory videos on social media. Continuous monitoring of participants via smartwatches and daily questionnaires further revealed considerable differences in stress, mood, step counts, sleep quality, and duration in the first week after the October 7 events among those who later developed PTSD. This study demonstrates the unprecedented amplifying effect of mass media on mental health in terror and war settings and highlights the potential of continuous monitoring for early detection and prompt treatment of those in need.\nEffects of Diazepam on Hippocampal Blood Flow in People at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis\nAuthors: Livingston, N. R.; Kiemes, A.; Devenyi, G. A.; Knight, S.; Lukow, P. B.; Jelen, L.; Reilly, T.; Dima, A.; Nettis, M. A.; Casetta, C.; Agyekum, T.; Zelaya, F.; Spencer, T.; De Micheli, A.; Fusar-Poli, P.; Grace, A. A.; Williams, S. C. R.; McGuire, P.; Egerton, A.; Chakravarty, M. M.; Modinos, G.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23299658\nBackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals. MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield. ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 24.1[{+/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 26.5[{+/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR\u003c0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR\u003c0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR\u003c0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225). ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.\nThe antidepressant effects of vaporized N,N-Dimethyltryptamine: a preliminary report in treatment-resistant depression\nAuthors: Falchi-Carvalho, M.; Barros, H.; Bolcont, R.; Laborde, S.; Wiessner, I.; Silva, S. R. B.; Montanini, D.; Barbosa, D.; Teixeira, E.; Florence-Vilela, R.; Almeida, R.; Macedo, R. K. A.; Arichelle, F.; J. Pantrigo, E.; Arcoverde, E.; Galvao-Coelho, N.; Araujo, D. B.; Palhano-Fontes, F.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23300610\nIntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments. Clinical Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov NCT06094907\nIsolating transdiagnostic effects reveals specific genetic profiles in psychiatric disorders.\nAuthors: Keser, E.; Liao, W.; Allegrini, A. G.; Rimfeld, K.; Eley, T. C.; Plomin, R.; Malanchini, M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.23300292\nEvidence indicates a great degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric diagnoses. Accounting for these transdiagnostic effects can sharpen research on disorder-specific genetic architecture. Here we isolate genetic effects that are shared across 11 major psychiatric disorders (p factor) to gain further insight into genetic specificity and comorbidity over and above that contributed by the p factor, unique to each psychiatric disorder. After adjusting for transdiagnostic genetic effects, we identified novel SNP associations and some changes in enrichment patterns. We examined genetic correlations among adjusted psychiatric traits as well as relationships with other biobehavioural traits. The landscape of genetic associations between pairs of psychiatric disorders changed substantially, and their genetic correlations with biobehavioural traits showed greater specificity. Isolating transdiagnostic genetic effects across major psychiatric disorders provides a nuanced understanding of disorder-specific genetic architecture and may help guide diagnostic nomenclature and treatment research.\nA participatory action research study to explore adolescents experiences of adverse childhood experiences through creative workshops: a protocol\nAuthors: Butcher, I.; Mankee Williams, A.; Hugh-Jones, S.; Cooke, P.; Teasdale, B.; Shaughnessy, N.; Pavarini, G.; Smith, L.; Bhui, K.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300349\nIntroductionAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health in adolescence. There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health. Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing. Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally. Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). - This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban. - There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model. - This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research. - This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.\nIncreased blood brain barrier leakage in schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared to healthy controls in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging\nAuthors: Moussiopoulou, J.; Yakimov, V.; Rauchmann, B.; Toth, H.; Melcher, J.; Jaeger, I.; Lutz, I.; Kallweit, M.; Papazov, B.; Seelos, K.; Dehsarvi, A.; Roell, L.; Campana, M.; Raabe, F.; Maurus, I.; Falkai, P.; Hasan, A.; Franzmeier, N.; Keeser, D.; Wagner, E.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.23299782\nBackgroundThere is growing evidence for inflammatory mechanisms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) that have been associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Previous studies investigating the BBB in SSD focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, that cannot adequately assess BBB integrity. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) represents a sensitive method for investigating subtle barrier breakdown in vivo. So far, only one pilot study has investigated BBB breakdown in SSD with DCE-MRI, in a relatively small cohort. We hypothesized higher leakage in SSD compared to HC, indicative of a clinical sub-phenotype of SSD. MethodsForty-one people with SSD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the final analyses of the cross-sectional study. DCE-MRI, clinical characterization, cognitive assessments, blood and CSF analyses were conducted. The volume transfer constant Ktrans was calculated with pharmacokinetic modelling (Patlak method), to estimate the rate of contrast agent transfer between blood and the brains extravascular space. Ktrans maps were compared between the groups to detect group differences in BBB leakage. Within the SSD cohort, the association between leakage and clinical characteristics was investigated with linear regression analyses. ResultsGroup comparisons of Ktrans maps showed higher leakage in SSD compared to HC on a whole brain level. The effect was more pronounced in first episode compared to multiple episode psychosis. No association was detected between leakage and measures of cognition, psychopathology, peripheral inflammation and albumin CSF/serum ratio. DiscussionThis is the largest study to date investigating the BBB in SSD with DCE-MRI in a multimodal approach, allowing direct exploration of the BBB, compared to a HC group. The integrity of the BBB is crucial for maintaining the brains microenvironment, and its disruption could be associated with potential immune system abnormalities. The results of this study provide the first in vivo evidence of higher BBB leakage on a whole brain level compared to HC. The disruption of the BBB in SSD, as detected through DCE-MRI, may provide insights into the diseases mechanisms and potential for targeted treatments. Further research in this area may clarify specific biological disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.\nNeurometabolic dysfunction in psychosis observed with 7 T MRS\nAuthors: Schallmo, M.-P.; Demro, C.; Killebrew, K. W.; Olman, C. A.; Sponheim, S. R.; Marjanska, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300788\nAltered brain chemistry is thought to contribute to impairments in cognitive and perceptual functioning in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP). As heritable genetic factors shape the development of psychosis, these alterations in brain chemistry may extend to biological relatives of PwPP. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method for quantifying the concentration of various neurochemicals in the human brain. A number of MRS studies in different brain regions have been performed in PwPP, and to a lesser extent in relatives, but results have been largely mixed. There are a number of methodological issues that may have influenced previous findings. We show here that when such issues are addressed, MRS reveals a pattern of neurometabolic dysfunction in PwPP. We acquired MRS data at 7 tesla with an ultra-short echo time (TE = 8 ms) sequence in both occipital and prefrontal cortices from 43 healthy controls, 42 first-degree biological relatives, and 64 PwPP. We saw reduced levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the occipital lobe in PwPP and their relatives (versus controls), and lower N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in prefrontal cortex in PwPP versus controls. Surprisingly, we also saw markedly increased levels of glucose in both occipital and prefrontal cortices in PwPP. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that higher glucose levels were linked to higher psychiatric symptom levels and impairments in visual task performance. Together, our findings point to a disruption in neural metabolism across multiple brain areas in PwPP that is associated with impaired cognitive and perceptual functioning.\nA mobile app providing individually-tailored psychoeducation about sleep for older adults with chronic health conditions and low health literacy\nAuthors: Ownby, R. L.; Thomas-Purcell, K.; Purcell, D.; Caballero, J.; Tewary, S.; Davenport, R.; Simonson, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300726\nObjectiveThis paper reports the effect of a mobile app that provides tailored information about sleep to individuals aged 40 and older who have chronic health conditions and low health literacy. MethodsThe sleep module was a part of a multitopic app focused on chronic disease self-management. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sleep psychoeducation at reading levels equivalent to 3rd, 6th or 8th grade. The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which was completed at baseline, after the intervention, and again three months later. Outcomes were assessed using repeated measures mixed effects models. ResultsMost participants were Black, Indigenous, or Other Persons of Color (BIPOC; 87%); they had average reading level at the 7th grade. Health literacy, socioeconomic status, number of health conditions, and the interventions effect were related to the PSQI. The PSQI score significantly decreased over the course of the three study visits for all groups, consistent with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.40). No effect of treatment group was observed. ConclusionResults suggest that a brief tailored information intervention may be beneficial for individuals aged 40 and older who have low health literacy and chronic health conditions. Further development of the intervention may enhance its clinical effectiveness.

Contrary to previous assumptions, the clinical course of ADHD in adulthood is characterised by dynamic changes influenced by stimulant treatment. To improve the precision of treatment, the identification of a predictive neuroimaging biomarker would be of great clinical importance. In this study, we explore the potential of seed-based functional connectivity (FC) as a predictive tool for assessing the clinical course of ADHD symptoms. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 54 adult ADHD patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 3 Tesla scanner. All patients received stimulant treatment during an initial run-in period. After an average of three years, only subjective responders continued treatment (n=34), while subjective non-responders discontinued medication (n=20). We reassessed patients after three years of treatment to 1) evaluate the prediction of individual outcome by baseline fMRI and 2) to investigate differences in prediction by baseline fMRI depending on long-term treatment vs. discontinuation. Our investigation focused on determining whether a relationship could be established between resting-state FC of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the trajectory of symptom development, as well as identifying possible differences in FC between individuals who had been on long-term stimulant treatment and those who had not used stimulants at the time of follow-up. In general, reduced FC between the NAc and the default mode network (DMN) was associated with initially higher symptom burden, whereas patterns of improvement correlated with reduced FC between the NAc and the salience network (SN). Comparatively, higher FC between the NAc and the SN was associated with better symptom outcomes in patients receiving long-term stimulant medication, whereas lower FC between the NAc and the SN was correlated with a more favourable prognosis in non-responders. Our prospective fMRI study suggests that functional connectivity between the dopaminergic reward circuitry and the SN, especially the insula, is predictive of better ADHD symptom outcomes. This work highlights the potential of dopaminergic functional connectivity as a prognostic factor in ADHD. While future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted, our study highlights the role of the NAc in the prognosis of ADHD.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The coordinated terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023, resulted in catastrophic atrocities, and marked the beginning of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. The overwhelming coverage by mainstream and social media, characterized by extreme details and graphic images, vividly transported viewers to the horrifying scene. It remains unclear to what extent such indirect exposure influences the occurrence of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. We analyzed data from a three-year prospective study in which 4,797 participants received smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, supplemented by a nationwide clinical survey with 2,536 participants. Among the participants not directly exposed, we estimated PTSD prevalence to be 22.9-36.0% and moderate to severe anxiety prevalence to be 22.9-55.32%, with 752,057 daily questionnaires before and after October 7 further indicating higher stress levels than those reported in previous events, including political disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and past armed conflicts. The occurrences of PTSD and anxiety are well explained by increased and persistent news consumption, and especially by the availability of gory videos on social media. Continuous monitoring of participants via smartwatches and daily questionnaires further revealed considerable differences in stress, mood, step counts, sleep quality, and duration in the first week after the October 7 events among those who later developed PTSD. This study demonstrates the unprecedented amplifying effect of mass media on mental health in terror and war settings and highlights the potential of continuous monitoring for early detection and prompt treatment of those in need.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals.

MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield.

ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 24.1[{&#43;/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 26.5[{&#43;/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR&lt;0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR&lt;0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR&lt;0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225).

ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing.

ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission.

DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

        <p class="abstract">Evidence indicates a great degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric diagnoses. Accounting for these transdiagnostic effects can sharpen research on disorder-specific genetic architecture. Here we isolate genetic effects that are shared across 11 major psychiatric disorders (p factor) to gain further insight into genetic specificity and comorbidity over and above that contributed by the p factor, unique to each psychiatric disorder. After adjusting for transdiagnostic genetic effects, we identified novel SNP associations and some changes in enrichment patterns. We examined genetic correlations among adjusted psychiatric traits as well as relationships with other biobehavioural traits. The landscape of genetic associations between pairs of psychiatric disorders changed substantially, and their genetic correlations with biobehavioural traits showed greater specificity. Isolating transdiagnostic genetic effects across major psychiatric disorders provides a nuanced understanding of disorder-specific genetic architecture and may help guide diagnostic nomenclature and treatment research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health in adolescence. There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health.

Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing.

Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally.

Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
- This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban.
- There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model.
- This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research.
- This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is growing evidence for inflammatory mechanisms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) that have been associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Previous studies investigating the BBB in SSD focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, that cannot adequately assess BBB integrity. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) represents a sensitive method for investigating subtle barrier breakdown in vivo. So far, only one pilot study has investigated BBB breakdown in SSD with DCE-MRI, in a relatively small cohort. We hypothesized higher leakage in SSD compared to HC, indicative of a clinical sub-phenotype of SSD.

MethodsForty-one people with SSD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the final analyses of the cross-sectional study. DCE-MRI, clinical characterization, cognitive assessments, blood and CSF analyses were conducted. The volume transfer constant Ktrans was calculated with pharmacokinetic modelling (Patlak method), to estimate the rate of contrast agent transfer between blood and the brains extravascular space. Ktrans maps were compared between the groups to detect group differences in BBB leakage. Within the SSD cohort, the association between leakage and clinical characteristics was investigated with linear regression analyses.

ResultsGroup comparisons of Ktrans maps showed higher leakage in SSD compared to HC on a whole brain level. The effect was more pronounced in first episode compared to multiple episode psychosis. No association was detected between leakage and measures of cognition, psychopathology, peripheral inflammation and albumin CSF/serum ratio.

DiscussionThis is the largest study to date investigating the BBB in SSD with DCE-MRI in a multimodal approach, allowing direct exploration of the BBB, compared to a HC group. The integrity of the BBB is crucial for maintaining the brains microenvironment, and its disruption could be associated with potential immune system abnormalities. The results of this study provide the first in vivo evidence of higher BBB leakage on a whole brain level compared to HC. The disruption of the BBB in SSD, as detected through DCE-MRI, may provide insights into the diseases mechanisms and potential for targeted treatments. Further research in this area may clarify specific biological disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Altered brain chemistry is thought to contribute to impairments in cognitive and perceptual functioning in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP). As heritable genetic factors shape the development of psychosis, these alterations in brain chemistry may extend to biological relatives of PwPP. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method for quantifying the concentration of various neurochemicals in the human brain. A number of MRS studies in different brain regions have been performed in PwPP, and to a lesser extent in relatives, but results have been largely mixed. There are a number of methodological issues that may have influenced previous findings. We show here that when such issues are addressed, MRS reveals a pattern of neurometabolic dysfunction in PwPP. We acquired MRS data at 7 tesla with an ultra-short echo time (TE = 8 ms) sequence in both occipital and prefrontal cortices from 43 healthy controls, 42 first-degree biological relatives, and 64 PwPP. We saw reduced levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the occipital lobe in PwPP and their relatives (versus controls), and lower N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in prefrontal cortex in PwPP versus controls. Surprisingly, we also saw markedly increased levels of glucose in both occipital and prefrontal cortices in PwPP. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that higher glucose levels were linked to higher psychiatric symptom levels and impairments in visual task performance. Together, our findings point to a disruption in neural metabolism across multiple brain areas in PwPP that is associated with impaired cognitive and perceptual functioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis paper reports the effect of a mobile app that provides tailored information about sleep to individuals aged 40 and older who have chronic health conditions and low health literacy.

MethodsThe sleep module was a part of a multitopic app focused on chronic disease self-management. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sleep psychoeducation at reading levels equivalent to 3rd, 6th or 8th grade. The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which was completed at baseline, after the intervention, and again three months later. Outcomes were assessed using repeated measures mixed effects models.

ResultsMost participants were Black, Indigenous, or Other Persons of Color (BIPOC; 87%); they had average reading level at the 7th grade. Health literacy, socioeconomic status, number of health conditions, and the interventions effect were related to the PSQI. The PSQI score significantly decreased over the course of the three study visits for all groups, consistent with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.40). No effect of treatment group was observed.

ConclusionResults suggest that a brief tailored information intervention may be beneficial for individuals aged 40 and older who have low health literacy and chronic health conditions. Further development of the intervention may enhance its clinical effectiveness.

        <p class="abstract">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that often persists into adulthood, contributing to a challenging trajectory characterised by increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Contrary to previous assumptions, the clinical course of ADHD in adulthood is characterised by dynamic changes influenced by stimulant treatment. To improve the precision of treatment, the identification of a predictive neuroimaging biomarker would be of great clinical importance.

In this study, we explore the potential of seed-based functional connectivity (FC) as a predictive tool for assessing the clinical course of ADHD symptoms. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 54 adult ADHD patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 3 Tesla scanner. All patients received stimulant treatment during an initial run-in period. After an average of three years, only subjective responders continued treatment (n=34), while subjective non-responders discontinued medication (n=20). We reassessed patients after three years of treatment to 1) evaluate the prediction of individual outcome by baseline fMRI and 2) to investigate differences in prediction by baseline fMRI depending on long-term treatment vs. discontinuation.

Our investigation focused on determining whether a relationship could be established between resting-state FC of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the trajectory of symptom development, as well as identifying possible differences in FC between individuals who had been on long-term stimulant treatment and those who had not used stimulants at the time of follow-up.

In general, reduced FC between the NAc and the default mode network (DMN) was associated with initially higher symptom burden, whereas patterns of improvement correlated with reduced FC between the NAc and the salience network (SN).

Comparatively, higher FC between the NAc and the SN was associated with better symptom outcomes in patients receiving long-term stimulant medication, whereas lower FC between the NAc and the SN was correlated with a more favourable prognosis in non-responders.

Our prospective fMRI study suggests that functional connectivity between the dopaminergic reward circuitry and the SN, especially the insula, is predictive of better ADHD symptom outcomes. This work highlights the potential of dopaminergic functional connectivity as a prognostic factor in ADHD. While future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted, our study highlights the role of the NAc in the prognosis of ADHD.</p>
