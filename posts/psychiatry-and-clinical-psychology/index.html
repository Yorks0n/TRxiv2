A.\nScore: 37.2, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296759\nBackgroundRumination is a transdiagnostic problem that is common in major depressive disorder (MDD). Rumination Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (RF-CBT) explicitly targets the ruminative habit. This study examined changes in brain activation during a rumination induction task in adolescents with remitted MDD following RF-CBT. We also evaluated the reliability of the rumination task among adolescents who received treatment as usual (TAU). MethodFifty-five adolescents ages 14-17 completed a self-relevant rumination induction fMRI task and were then randomized to either RF-CBT (n = 30) or TAU (n = 25). Participants completed the task a second time either following 10-14 sessions of RF-CBT or the equivalent time delay for the TAU group. We assessed activation change in the RF-CBT group using paired-samples t-tests and reliability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of five rumination-related ROIs during each of three blocks for the TAU and RF-CBT groups separately (Rumination Instruction, Rumination Prompt, and Distraction). ResultsFollowing treatment, participants in the RF-CBT group demonstrated an increase in activation of the left precuneus during Rumination Instruction and the left angular and superior temporal gyri during Rumination Prompt (p \u003c .01). The TAU group demonstrated fair to excellent reliability (M = .52, range = .27-.86) across most ROIs and task blocks. In contrast, the RF-CBT group demonstrated poor reliability across most ROIs and task blocks (M = .21, range = -.19-.69). ConclusionRF-CBT appears to lead to rumination-related brain change. We demonstrated that the rumination induction task has fair to excellent reliability among individuals who do not receive an intervention that explicitly targets the ruminative habit, whereas reliability of this task is largely poor in the context of RF-CBT. This has meaningful implications in longitudinal and intervention studies, particularly when conceptualizing it as an important target for intervention. It also suggests one of many possible mechanisms for why fMRI test-retest reliability can be low that appears unrelated to the methodology itself.\nTranscriptomic pathology of neocortical microcircuit cell types across psychiatric disorders\nAuthors: Arbabi, K.; Newton, D. F.; Oh, H.; Davie, M. C.; Lewis, D. A.; Wainberg, M.; Tripathy, S. J.; Sibille, E.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297640\nBackgroundPsychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) are characterized by altered cognition and mood, brain functions that depend on information processing by cortical microcircuits. We hypothesized that psychiatric disorders would display cell type-specific transcriptional alterations in neuronal subpopulations that make up cortical microcircuits: excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP), somatostatin- (SST), and parvalbumin- (PVALB) expressing inhibitory interneurons. MethodsWe performed cell type-specific molecular profiling of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood and cognitive control, using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq). We sequenced libraries from 130 whole cells pooled per neuronal subtype (VIP, SST, PVALB, superficial and deep PYR) in 76 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Tissue Donation Program, evenly split between MDD, BD, and SCZ subjects and healthy controls. ResultsWe identified hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes and biological pathways across disorders and neuronal subtypes, with the vast majority in inhibitory neuron types, primarily PVALB. DE genes were distinct across cell types, but partially shared across disorders, with nearly all shared genes involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. Coordinated alterations in biological pathways were observed between select pairs of microcircuit cell types and partially shared across disorders. Finally, DE genes coincided with known risk variants from psychiatric genome-wide association studies, indicating cell type-specific convergence between genetic and transcriptomic risk for psychiatric disorders. ConclusionsWe present the first cell type-specific dataset of cortical microcircuit gene expression across multiple psychiatric disorders. Each neuronal subtype displayed unique dysregulation signatures, some shared across cell types and disorders. Inhibitory interneurons showed more dysregulation than excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our study suggests transdiagnostic cortical microcircuit pathology in SCZ, BD, and MDD and sets the stage for larger-scale studies investigating how cell circuit-based changes contribute to shared psychiatric risk.\nAssociations Between Polygenic Scores for Cognitive and Non-cognitive Factors of Educational Attainment and Measures of Behavior, Psychopathology, and Neuroimaging in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\nAuthors: Gorelik, A. J.; Paul, S. E.; Miller, A. P.; Baranger, D. A.; Lin, S.; Zhang, W.; Elsayed, N. M.; Modi, H.; Addala, P.; Bijsterbosch, J. D.; Barch, D. M.; Karcher, N. R.; Hatoum, A. S.; Agrawal, A.; Bogdan, R.; Johnson, E. C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297675\nBackgroundBoth cognitive and non-cognitive (e.g., traits like curiosity) factors are critical for social and emotional functioning and independently predict educational attainment. These factors are heritable and genetically correlated with a range of health-relevant traits and behaviors in adulthood (e.g., risk-taking, psychopathology). However, whether these associations are present during adolescence, and to what extent these relationships diverge, could have implications for adolescent health and well-being. MethodsUsing data from 5,517 youth of European ancestry from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, we examined associations between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non-cognitive factors and outcomes related to cognition, socioeconomic status, risk tolerance and decision-making, substance initiation, psychopathology, and brain structure. ResultsCognitive and non-cognitive PGSs were both positively associated with cognitive performance and family income, and negatively associated with ADHD and severity of psychotic-like experiences. The cognitive PGS was also associated with greater risk-taking, delayed discounting, and anorexia, as well as lower likelihood of nicotine initiation. The cognitive PGS was further associated with cognition scores and anorexia in within-sibling analyses, suggesting these results do not solely reflect the effects of assortative mating or passive gene-environment correlations. The cognitive PGS showed significantly stronger associations with cortical volumes than the non-cognitive PGS and was associated with right hemisphere caudal anterior cingulate and pars-orbitalis in within-sibling analyses, while the non-cognitive PGS showed stronger associations with white matter fractional anisotropy and a significant within-sibling association for right superior corticostriate-frontal cortex. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that PGSs for cognitive and non-cognitive factors show similar associations with cognition and socioeconomic status as well as other psychosocial outcomes, but distinct associations with regional neural phenotypes in this adolescent sample.\nDigital Screener of Socio-Motor Agency Balancing Autonomy and Control\nAuthors: Bermperidis, T.; Torres, E. B.; Rai, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.23297428\nDyadic social interactions evoke complex dynamics between two agents that while exchanging unequal levels of body autonomy and motor control, may find a fine balance to take turns and gradually build social rapport. To study the evolution of such complex interactions, we currently rely exclusively on subjective pencil and paper means. Here we complement this approach with objective biometrics of socio-motor behaviors conducive of socio-motor agency. Using a common clinical test as the backdrop of our study to probe social interactions between a child and a clinician, we demonstrate new ways to streamline the detection of social readiness potential in both typically developing and autistic children. We highlight differences between males and females and uncover a new data type amenable to generalize our results to any social settings. The new methods convert dyadic bodily biorhythmic activity into spike trains and demonstrates that in the context of dyadic behavioral analyses, they are well characterized by a continuous gamma process independent from corresponding binary spike rates. We offer a new framework that combines stochastic analyses, nonlinear dynamics, and information theory, to facilitate scaling the screening and tracking of social interactions with applications to autism.\nDistress symptoms of old age and mild cognitive impairment are two distinct dimensions in older adults without major depression: effects of adverse childhood experiences and negative life events\nAuthors: Tran-Chi, V.-L.; Maes, M.; Nantachai, G.; Hemrungrojn, S.; Solmi, M.; Tunvirachaisakul, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.23297890\nBackground: Studies in old adults showed bidirectional interconnections between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and affective symptoms and that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) may affect both factors. Nevertheless, these associations may be confined to older adults with clinical depression. Aims: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms of aMCI and affective symptoms in older adults without major depression (MDD) or dysfunctions in activities of daily living (ADL). Methods: This case-control study recruited 61 participants with aMCI (diagnosed using Petersen's criteria) and 59 older adults without aMCI and excluded subjects with MDD and ADL dysfunctions. Results: We uncovered 2 distinct dimensions, namely distress symptoms of old age (DSOA) comprising anxiety, depression, perceived stress and neuroticism scores, and mild cognitive dysfunctions (mCoDy) comprising episodic memory test scores, and the total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. A large part of the variance (37.9%) in DSOA scores was explained by ACE, negative life events (health and financial problems), a subjective feeling of cognitive decline, and education (all positively). While ACE and NLE have a highly significant impact on the DSOA, they are not associated with the mCoDy scores. Cluster analysis showed that the diagnosis of aMCI is overinclusive because some subjects with DSOA symptoms may be incorrectly classified as aMCI. Conclusions: The clinical impact is that clinicians should carefully screen older adults for DSOA after excluding MDD. DSOA might be misinterpreted as aMCI.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPsychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) are characterized by altered cognition and mood, brain functions that depend on information processing by cortical microcircuits. We hypothesized that psychiatric disorders would display cell type-specific transcriptional alterations in neuronal subpopulations that make up cortical microcircuits: excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP), somatostatin- (SST), and parvalbumin- (PVALB) expressing inhibitory interneurons.

MethodsWe performed cell type-specific molecular profiling of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood and cognitive control, using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq). We sequenced libraries from 130 whole cells pooled per neuronal subtype (VIP, SST, PVALB, superficial and deep PYR) in 76 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Tissue Donation Program, evenly split between MDD, BD, and SCZ subjects and healthy controls.

ResultsWe identified hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes and biological pathways across disorders and neuronal subtypes, with the vast majority in inhibitory neuron types, primarily PVALB. DE genes were distinct across cell types, but partially shared across disorders, with nearly all shared genes involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. Coordinated alterations in biological pathways were observed between select pairs of microcircuit cell types and partially shared across disorders. Finally, DE genes coincided with known risk variants from psychiatric genome-wide association studies, indicating cell type-specific convergence between genetic and transcriptomic risk for psychiatric disorders.

ConclusionsWe present the first cell type-specific dataset of cortical microcircuit gene expression across multiple psychiatric disorders. Each neuronal subtype displayed unique dysregulation signatures, some shared across cell types and disorders. Inhibitory interneurons showed more dysregulation than excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our study suggests transdiagnostic cortical microcircuit pathology in SCZ, BD, and MDD and sets the stage for larger-scale studies investigating how cell circuit-based changes contribute to shared psychiatric risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBoth cognitive and non-cognitive (e.g., traits like curiosity) factors are critical for social and emotional functioning and independently predict educational attainment. These factors are heritable and genetically correlated with a range of health-relevant traits and behaviors in adulthood (e.g., risk-taking, psychopathology). However, whether these associations are present during adolescence, and to what extent these relationships diverge, could have implications for adolescent health and well-being.

MethodsUsing data from 5,517 youth of European ancestry from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, we examined associations between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non-cognitive factors and outcomes related to cognition, socioeconomic status, risk tolerance and decision-making, substance initiation, psychopathology, and brain structure.

ResultsCognitive and non-cognitive PGSs were both positively associated with cognitive performance and family income, and negatively associated with ADHD and severity of psychotic-like experiences. The cognitive PGS was also associated with greater risk-taking, delayed discounting, and anorexia, as well as lower likelihood of nicotine initiation. The cognitive PGS was further associated with cognition scores and anorexia in within-sibling analyses, suggesting these results do not solely reflect the effects of assortative mating or passive gene-environment correlations. The cognitive PGS showed significantly stronger associations with cortical volumes than the non-cognitive PGS and was associated with right hemisphere caudal anterior cingulate and pars-orbitalis in within-sibling analyses, while the non-cognitive PGS showed stronger associations with white matter fractional anisotropy and a significant within-sibling association for right superior corticostriate-frontal cortex.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest that PGSs for cognitive and non-cognitive factors show similar associations with cognition and socioeconomic status as well as other psychosocial outcomes, but distinct associations with regional neural phenotypes in this adolescent sample.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dyadic social interactions evoke complex dynamics between two agents that while exchanging unequal levels of body autonomy and motor control, may find a fine balance to take turns and gradually build social rapport. To study the evolution of such complex interactions, we currently rely exclusively on subjective pencil and paper means. Here we complement this approach with objective biometrics of socio-motor behaviors conducive of socio-motor agency. Using a common clinical test as the backdrop of our study to probe social interactions between a child and a clinician, we demonstrate new ways to streamline the detection of social readiness potential in both typically developing and autistic children. We highlight differences between males and females and uncover a new data type amenable to generalize our results to any social settings. The new methods convert dyadic bodily biorhythmic activity into spike trains and demonstrates that in the context of dyadic behavioral analyses, they are well characterized by a continuous gamma process independent from corresponding binary spike rates. We offer a new framework that combines stochastic analyses, nonlinear dynamics, and information theory, to facilitate scaling the screening and tracking of social interactions with applications to autism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Studies in old adults showed bidirectional interconnections between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and affective symptoms and that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) may affect both factors. Nevertheless, these associations may be confined to older adults with clinical depression. Aims: To delineate the relationship between clinical symptoms of aMCI and affective symptoms in older adults without major depression (MDD) or dysfunctions in activities of daily living (ADL). Methods: This case-control study recruited 61 participants with aMCI (diagnosed using Petersen&#39;s criteria) and 59 older adults without aMCI and excluded subjects with MDD and ADL dysfunctions. Results: We uncovered 2 distinct dimensions, namely distress symptoms of old age (DSOA) comprising anxiety, depression, perceived stress and neuroticism scores, and mild cognitive dysfunctions (mCoDy) comprising episodic memory test scores, and the total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. A large part of the variance (37.9%) in DSOA scores was explained by ACE, negative life events (health and financial problems), a subjective feeling of cognitive decline, and education (all positively). While ACE and NLE have a highly significant impact on the DSOA, they are not associated with the mCoDy scores. Cluster analysis showed that the diagnosis of aMCI is overinclusive because some subjects with DSOA symptoms may be incorrectly classified as aMCI. Conclusions: The clinical impact is that clinicians should carefully screen older adults for DSOA after excluding MDD. DSOA might be misinterpreted as aMCI.</p>
