To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. Methods To examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). Findings We identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli ~3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. Interpretation Together, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

K.; Raznahan, A.; Tucker-Drob, E. M.; Choi, K. W.; Ge, T.; Smoller, J. W.; Palmer, A. A.; Sanchez-Roige, S.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299133\nImpulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.\nNon-random Mating Patterns in Education, Mental, and Somatic Health: A Population Study on Within- and Cross-Trait Associations\nAuthors: Torvik, F. A.; Sunde, H. F.; Cheesman, R.; Eftedal, N. H.; Keller, M. C.; Ystrom, E.; Eilertsen, E. M.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299055\nPartners resemble each other on many traits, such as health and education. The traits are usually studied one by one in data from established couples and with potential participation bias. We studied all Norwegian parents who had their first child between 2016 and 2020 (N=187,926) and the siblings of these parents. We analysed grade point averages (GPA), educational attainment (EA), and medical records with prospective diagnostic data on 10 mental and 10 somatic health conditions measured 10 to 5 years before childbirth. We found stronger partner similarity in mental (median r=0.14) than in somatic health conditions (median r=0.04), with ubiquitous cross-trait correlations for mental health conditions (median r=0.13). GPA correlated 0.43 and EA 0.47 between partners. High GPA or EA was associated with better mental (median r=-0.16) and somatic (median r=-0.08) health in partners. Elevated correlations for mental health (median r=0.25) in established couples indicated convergence. Analyses of data on siblings and in-laws revealed deviations from direct assortment, suggesting instead indirect assortment based on related traits. GPA and EA accounted for 30-40% of the partner correlations in health. This has implications for the distribution of risk factors among children and for studies of intergenerational transmission.\nSmartphone keyboard dynamics predict affect in suicidal ideation\nAuthors: Knol, L.; Nagpal, A.; Leaning, I. E.; Idda, E.; Hussain, F.; Ning, E.; Eisenlohr-Moul, T. A.; Beckmann, C. F.; Marquand, A. F.; Leow, A.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.23299169\nWhile digital phenotyping provides opportunities for unobtrusive, real-time mental health assessments, the integration of its modalities is not trivial due to high dimensionalities and discrepancies in sampling frequencies. We provide an integrated pipeline that solves these issues by transforming all modalities to the same time unit, applying temporal independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional modalities, and fusing the modalities with linear mixed-effects models. We applied our approach to integrate high-quality, daily self-report data with BiAffect keyboard dynamics derived from a clinical suicidality sample of mental health outpatients. Applying the ICA to the self-report data (104 participants, 5712 days of data) revealed components related to well-being, anhedonia, and irritability and social dysfunction. Mixed-effects models (55 participants, 1794 days) showed that less phone movement while typing was associated with more anhedonia ({beta} = -0.12, p = 0.00030). We consider this method to be widely applicable to dense, longitudinal digital phenotyping data.\nApproaches to improve mental health care for autistic children and young people: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Pemovska, T.; Loizou, S.; Appleton, R.; Spain, D.; Stefanidou, T.; Kular, A.; Cooper, R.; Greenburgh, A.; Griffiths, J.; Barnett, P.; Foye, U.; Baldwin, H.; Minchin, M.; Brady, G.; Saunders, K.; Ahmed, N.; Jackson, R.; Olive, R. R.; Parker, J.; Timmerman, A.; Sapiets, S.; Driskell, E.; Chipp, B.; Parsons, B.; Totsika, V.; Mandy, W.; Pender, R.; Clery, P.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Simpson, A.; Johnson, S.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299246\nAutistic children and young people (CYP) experience mental health difficulties but face many barriers to accessing and benefiting from mental health care. There is a need to explore strategies in mental health care for autistic CYP to guide clinical practice and future research and support their mental health needs. Our aim was to identify strategies used to improve mental health care for autistic CYP and examine evidence on their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. All study designs reporting acceptability/feasibility outcomes and empirical quantitative studies reporting effectiveness outcomes for strategies tested within mental health care were eligible. We conducted a narrative synthesis and separate meta-analyses by informant (self, parent, clinician). Fifty-seven papers were included, with most investigating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anxiety and several exploring service-level strategies, such as autism screening tools, clinician training, adaptations regarding organisation of services. Most papers described caregiver involvement in therapy and reported adaptations to communication and intervention content; a few reported environmental adjustments. In the meta-analyses, parent- and clinician-reported outcomes, but not self-reported outcomes, showed with moderate certainty that CBT for anxiety was an effective treatment compared to any comparison condition in reducing anxiety symptoms in autistic individuals. The certainty of evidence for effectiveness, synthesised narratively, ranged from low to moderate. Evidence for feasibility and acceptability tended to be positive. Many identified strategies are simple, reasonable adjustments that can be implemented in services to enhance mental health care for autistic individuals. Notable research gaps persist, however.\nConvergent functional effects of antidepressants in major depressive disorder: a neuroimaging meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saberi, A.; Ebneabbasi, A.; Rahimi, S.; Sarebannejad, S.; Sen, Z. D.; Graf, H.; Walter, M.; Sorg, C.; Camilleri, J. A.; Laird, A. R.; Fox, P. T.; Valk, S. L.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298991\nBackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems. MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps. ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters. ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.\nTargeting the prefrontal-supplementary motor network in obsessive-compulsive disorder with intensified electrical stimulation in two dosages: A randomized, controlled trial\nAuthors: Alizadehgoradel, J.; Molaei, B.; Barzegar Jalali, K.; Pouresmali, A.; Sharifi, K.; Hallajian, A.-H.; Nejati, V.; Glinski, B.; Vicario, C. M.; Nitsche, M. A.; Salehinejad, M. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.23299285\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with a high disease burden, and treatment options are limited. We used intensified electrical stimulation in two dosages to target a main circuitry associated with the pathophysiology of OCD, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l- DLPFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and assessed clinical outcomes, neuropsychological performance and brain physiology. In a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial, thirty-nine patients with OCD were randomized to sham, 2-mA or 1-mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the l-DLPFC (F3) and SMA (FC2) with anodal and cathodal stimulation respectively. The treatment included 10 sessions of 20-minute stimulation delivered twice per day with 20-min between-session intervals. Outcome measures were reduction in OCD symptoms, anxiety and depressive states, performance on a neuropsychological test battery of response inhibition, working memory, attention, and oscillatory brain activities and functional connectivity. All outcome measures except EEG were examined at pre-intervention, post- intervention and 1-month follow-up times. The 2-mA protocol significantly reduced OCD symptoms, anxiety, depression states, and improved quality of life after the intervention up to 1- month follow-up compared to the sham group, while the 1-mA protocol reduced OCD symptoms only in the follow-up and depressive state immediately after and 1-month following the intervention. Both protocols partially improved response inhibition and the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to OCD-related stimuli and improved reaction time in working memory performance. Both protocols increased alpha oscillatory power and the 2-mA intensified protocol decreased delta power as well. Both protocols increased connectivity in higher frequency bands at frontal-central areas compared to the sham. Modulation of the prefrontal-supplementary motor network with intensified tDCS ameliorates OCD clinical symptoms and results in beneficial cognitive effects. The 2-mA intensified stimulation resulted in larger symptom reduction and improved more converging outcome variables related to therapeutic efficacy. These results support applying the intensified prefrontal-SMA tDCS in larger trials.\nComputational phenotyping of aberrant belief updating in individuals with schizotypal traits and schizophrenia\nAuthors: Mikus, N.; Lamm, C.; Mathys, C. D.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299069\nPsychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = - 0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.\nUnraveling the metabolomic architecture of autism in a large Danish population-based cohort\nAuthors: Ottosson, F.; Russo, F.; Abrahamsson, A.; MacSween, N.; Courraud, J.; Skogstrand, K.; Melander, O.; Ericson, U.; Orho-Melander, M.; Cohen, A. S.; Grove, J.; Mortensen, P. B.; Hougaard, D.; Ernst, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23298767\nThe prevalence of autism in Denmark has been increasing, reaching 1.65% among 10-year-old children and similar trends are seen elsewhere. Although there are several factors associated with autism, including genetic, environmental and prenatal factors, the molecular etiology of autism is largely unknown. Metabolomics has emerged as a tool to measure small molecules that reflect genetic, gut microbiome and dietary intake variations. Here, we apply untargeted metabolomics to over 1400 neonatal dried bloods spots, including neonates who later are diagnosed with autism and matching controls. Overall, we detect underlying molecular perturbations that precede autism related to metabolism of amino acids, acylcarnitines and peptides. In particular the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-leucine-proline and the carnitine-related 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB), were associated with an increased probability for autism. Analysis of genetic and dietary data in over 7000 adults revealed that 5-AVAB was associated with increased habitual dietary intake of dairy and with variants SLC22A5, coding for a transmembrane carnitine transporter protein involved in controlling intracellular carnitine levels. We identify 5-AVAB as a novel and potentially modifiable early biomarker for autism that may influence carnitine homeostasis.\nSocioeconomic Status and Depression - A Systematic Review\nAuthors: Jespersen, A.; Madden, R.; Whalley, H.; Reynolds, R.; Lawrie, S. M.; McIntosh, A. M.; Iveson, M. H.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23299380\nObjective Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with an increased risk of depression and psychiatric disorders in general. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to provide an estimate of the risk of clinical depression associated with low SES across cultures, age groups and study designs. Finally, we tested whether associations between SES and depression differed by the income of the country in which the study was conducted. Methods A literature search across five databases returned 7,943 studies. Title, abstract and full text screening resulted in 162 included studies of which 122 were meta-analysed, 22 were included in a cross-sectional narrative review and 19 studies were included in a longitudinal narrative review. Meta-analyses were divided into risk estimates for composite SES, income, education, and employment. Sensitivity analyses based on differences in economic situation in the country of study origin were performed to investigate a possible source of between study heterogeneity. Results Low SES was associated with an increased risk of depression across all measures of SES. Low income was associated with the highest odds ratio for depression (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.53-2.52). Sensitivity analyses revealed no significant differences in between-study heterogeneity or risk of depression between high- and low-income economy groups. Conclusions Comparable risks of depression across economy groups suggest that income relative to your peers, rather than absolute income, is a risk factor for depression. Preventative measures and possible policy interventions are discussed.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background COVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. Methods To examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). Findings We identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli ~3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. Interpretation Together, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

        <p class="abstract">Impulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Partners resemble each other on many traits, such as health and education. The traits are usually studied one by one in data from established couples and with potential participation bias. We studied all Norwegian parents who had their first child between 2016 and 2020 (N=187,926) and the siblings of these parents. We analysed grade point averages (GPA), educational attainment (EA), and medical records with prospective diagnostic data on 10 mental and 10 somatic health conditions measured 10 to 5 years before childbirth. We found stronger partner similarity in mental (median r=0.14) than in somatic health conditions (median r=0.04), with ubiquitous cross-trait correlations for mental health conditions (median r=0.13). GPA correlated 0.43 and EA 0.47 between partners. High GPA or EA was associated with better mental (median r=-0.16) and somatic (median r=-0.08) health in partners. Elevated correlations for mental health (median r=0.25) in established couples indicated convergence. Analyses of data on siblings and in-laws revealed deviations from direct assortment, suggesting instead indirect assortment based on related traits. GPA and EA accounted for 30-40% of the partner correlations in health. This has implications for the distribution of risk factors among children and for studies of intergenerational transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While digital phenotyping provides opportunities for unobtrusive, real-time mental health assessments, the integration of its modalities is not trivial due to high dimensionalities and discrepancies in sampling frequencies. We provide an integrated pipeline that solves these issues by transforming all modalities to the same time unit, applying temporal independent component analysis (ICA) to high-dimensional modalities, and fusing the modalities with linear mixed-effects models. We applied our approach to integrate high-quality, daily self-report data with BiAffect keyboard dynamics derived from a clinical suicidality sample of mental health outpatients. Applying the ICA to the self-report data (104 participants, 5712 days of data) revealed components related to well-being, anhedonia, and irritability and social dysfunction. Mixed-effects models (55 participants, 1794 days) showed that less phone movement while typing was associated with more anhedonia ({beta} = -0.12, p = 0.00030). We consider this method to be widely applicable to dense, longitudinal digital phenotyping data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autistic children and young people (CYP) experience mental health difficulties but face many barriers to accessing and benefiting from mental health care. There is a need to explore strategies in mental health care for autistic CYP to guide clinical practice and future research and support their mental health needs. Our aim was to identify strategies used to improve mental health care for autistic CYP and examine evidence on their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. All study designs reporting acceptability/feasibility outcomes and empirical quantitative studies reporting effectiveness outcomes for strategies tested within mental health care were eligible. We conducted a narrative synthesis and separate meta-analyses by informant (self, parent, clinician). Fifty-seven papers were included, with most investigating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anxiety and several exploring service-level strategies, such as autism screening tools, clinician training, adaptations regarding organisation of services. Most papers described caregiver involvement in therapy and reported adaptations to communication and intervention content; a few reported environmental adjustments. In the meta-analyses, parent- and clinician-reported outcomes, but not self-reported outcomes, showed with moderate certainty that CBT for anxiety was an effective treatment compared to any comparison condition in reducing anxiety symptoms in autistic individuals. The certainty of evidence for effectiveness, synthesised narratively, ranged from low to moderate. Evidence for feasibility and acceptability tended to be positive. Many identified strategies are simple, reasonable adjustments that can be implemented in services to enhance mental health care for autistic individuals. Notable research gaps persist, however.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems.

MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps.

ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters.

ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with a high disease burden, and treatment options are limited. We used intensified electrical stimulation in two dosages to target a main circuitry associated with the pathophysiology of OCD, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l- DLPFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and assessed clinical outcomes, neuropsychological performance and brain physiology. In a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial, thirty-nine patients with OCD were randomized to sham, 2-mA or 1-mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the l-DLPFC (F3) and SMA (FC2) with anodal and cathodal stimulation respectively. The treatment included 10 sessions of 20-minute stimulation delivered twice per day with 20-min between-session intervals. Outcome measures were reduction in OCD symptoms, anxiety and depressive states, performance on a neuropsychological test battery of response inhibition, working memory, attention, and oscillatory brain activities and functional connectivity. All outcome measures except EEG were examined at pre-intervention, post- intervention and 1-month follow-up times. The 2-mA protocol significantly reduced OCD symptoms, anxiety, depression states, and improved quality of life after the intervention up to 1- month follow-up compared to the sham group, while the 1-mA protocol reduced OCD symptoms only in the follow-up and depressive state immediately after and 1-month following the intervention. Both protocols partially improved response inhibition and the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to OCD-related stimuli and improved reaction time in working memory performance. Both protocols increased alpha oscillatory power and the 2-mA intensified protocol decreased delta power as well. Both protocols increased connectivity in higher frequency bands at frontal-central areas compared to the sham. Modulation of the prefrontal-supplementary motor network with intensified tDCS ameliorates OCD clinical symptoms and results in beneficial cognitive effects. The 2-mA intensified stimulation resulted in larger symptom reduction and improved more converging outcome variables related to therapeutic efficacy. These results support applying the intensified prefrontal-SMA tDCS in larger trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = - 0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The prevalence of autism in Denmark has been increasing, reaching 1.65% among 10-year-old children and similar trends are seen elsewhere. Although there are several factors associated with autism, including genetic, environmental and prenatal factors, the molecular etiology of autism is largely unknown. Metabolomics has emerged as a tool to measure small molecules that reflect genetic, gut microbiome and dietary intake variations. Here, we apply untargeted metabolomics to over 1400 neonatal dried bloods spots, including neonates who later are diagnosed with autism and matching controls. Overall, we detect underlying molecular perturbations that precede autism related to metabolism of amino acids, acylcarnitines and peptides. In particular the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-leucine-proline and the carnitine-related 5-aminovaleric acid betaine (5-AVAB), were associated with an increased probability for autism. Analysis of genetic and dietary data in over 7000 adults revealed that 5-AVAB was associated with increased habitual dietary intake of dairy and with variants SLC22A5, coding for a transmembrane carnitine transporter protein involved in controlling intracellular carnitine levels. We identify 5-AVAB as a novel and potentially modifiable early biomarker for autism that may influence carnitine homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with an increased risk of depression and psychiatric disorders in general. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to provide an estimate of the risk of clinical depression associated with low SES across cultures, age groups and study designs. Finally, we tested whether associations between SES and depression differed by the income of the country in which the study was conducted. Methods A literature search across five databases returned 7,943 studies. Title, abstract and full text screening resulted in 162 included studies of which 122 were meta-analysed, 22 were included in a cross-sectional narrative review and 19 studies were included in a longitudinal narrative review. Meta-analyses were divided into risk estimates for composite SES, income, education, and employment. Sensitivity analyses based on differences in economic situation in the country of study origin were performed to investigate a possible source of between study heterogeneity. Results Low SES was associated with an increased risk of depression across all measures of SES. Low income was associated with the highest odds ratio for depression (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.53-2.52). Sensitivity analyses revealed no significant differences in between-study heterogeneity or risk of depression between high- and low-income economy groups. Conclusions Comparable risks of depression across economy groups suggest that income relative to your peers, rather than absolute income, is a risk factor for depression. Preventative measures and possible policy interventions are discussed.</p>
