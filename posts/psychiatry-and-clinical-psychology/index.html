This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

E.; Hayes, R.; Corcoran, M.; Sheth, K. N.; Arnold, T. C.; Stein, J.; Glahn, D. C.; Jalbrzikowski, M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.24300892\nBackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people. MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches. ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume. Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness. ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.\nPre-event psychiatric states predict trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Nakai, F.; Kubo, T.; Oka, T.; Kobayashi, N.; Tanichi, M.; Murakami, M.; Hamamura, T.; Honjo, M.; Miyake, Y.; Ide, K.; Cortese, A.; Nagamine, M.; Chiba, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.23300571\nRecent time-dependent analyses of stress-related disorders have identified heterogeneity of trajectories and their modifying factors. While psychiatric patients are vulnerable to stress events, it is unclear how psychiatric conditions in the general population modulate subsequent stress responses. Using our longitudinal online survey from before the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic follow-ups (n = 3815 Japanese adults), here we identified four trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a latent growth mixture model; resilient, chronic, mild chronic, and early response. The depression/anxiety were identified as specific risk factors for the early-response trajectory. In contrast, general psychiatric burden and social withdrawal were identified as common risk/protective factors. Further, we estimated \"baseline\" PTSS to determine the predictability of the PTSS prognosis from pre-pandemic states. The chronic group showed significantly higher baseline PTSS scores than the mild-chronic and early-response groups, both of which were significantly higher than the resilient group. We concluded that prior psychiatric conditions significantly affect the PTSS trajectory. These results suggest that prior psychiatric conditions may be considered for the prevention and treatment of maladaptive stress responses.\nA large-scale online survey of patients and the general public: Preferring safe and noninvasive neuromodulation for mental health\nAuthors: Atkinson-Clement, C.; Junor, A.; Kaiser, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301043\nWhile neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation. HighlightsO_LIFocused ultrasound is the preferred intervention for brain and mental health conditions C_LIO_LIThe preference of techniques was consistent between healthy participants and patients suffering from brain or mental health conditions. C_LIO_LIGetting more information about different neuromodulation techniques reduced confusion and increased feelings of being excited, optimistic, and comfortable with these techniques C_LIO_LIThe ranking of preference is linked with the perceived safety but not with perceived efficiency of techniques indicating safety as more important criterion C_LI\nRisk and early signs of PTSD in people indirectly exposed to October 7 events\nAuthors: Yamin, D.; Lev-Ari, S.; Mofaz, M.; Elias, R.; Spiegel, D.; Yechezkel, M.; L. Brandeau, M.; Shmueli, E.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300048\nThe coordinated terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023, resulted in catastrophic atrocities, and marked the beginning of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. The overwhelming coverage by mainstream and social media, characterized by extreme details and graphic images, vividly transported viewers to the horrifying scene. It remains unclear to what extent such indirect exposure influences the occurrence of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. We analyzed data from a three-year prospective study in which 4,797 participants received smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, supplemented by a nationwide clinical survey with 2,536 participants. Among the participants not directly exposed, we estimated PTSD prevalence to be 22.9-36.0% and moderate to severe anxiety prevalence to be 22.9-55.32%, with 752,057 daily questionnaires before and after October 7 further indicating higher stress levels than those reported in previous events, including political disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and past armed conflicts. The occurrences of PTSD and anxiety are well explained by increased and persistent news consumption, and especially by the availability of gory videos on social media. Continuous monitoring of participants via smartwatches and daily questionnaires further revealed considerable differences in stress, mood, step counts, sleep quality, and duration in the first week after the October 7 events among those who later developed PTSD. This study demonstrates the unprecedented amplifying effect of mass media on mental health in terror and war settings and highlights the potential of continuous monitoring for early detection and prompt treatment of those in need.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people.

MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches.

ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume.

Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness.

ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent time-dependent analyses of stress-related disorders have identified heterogeneity of trajectories and their modifying factors. While psychiatric patients are vulnerable to stress events, it is unclear how psychiatric conditions in the general population modulate subsequent stress responses. Using our longitudinal online survey from before the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic follow-ups (n = 3815 Japanese adults), here we identified four trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a latent growth mixture model; resilient, chronic, mild chronic, and early response. The depression/anxiety were identified as specific risk factors for the early-response trajectory. In contrast, general psychiatric burden and social withdrawal were identified as common risk/protective factors. Further, we estimated &#34;baseline&#34; PTSS to determine the predictability of the PTSS prognosis from pre-pandemic states. The chronic group showed significantly higher baseline PTSS scores than the mild-chronic and early-response groups, both of which were significantly higher than the resilient group. We concluded that prior psychiatric conditions significantly affect the PTSS trajectory. These results suggest that prior psychiatric conditions may be considered for the prevention and treatment of maladaptive stress responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation.

HighlightsO_LIFocused ultrasound is the preferred intervention for brain and mental health conditions
C_LIO_LIThe preference of techniques was consistent between healthy participants and patients suffering from brain or mental health conditions.
C_LIO_LIGetting more information about different neuromodulation techniques reduced confusion and increased feelings of being excited, optimistic, and comfortable with these techniques
C_LIO_LIThe ranking of preference is linked with the perceived safety but not with perceived efficiency of techniques indicating safety as more important criterion

        <p class="abstract">The coordinated terrorist attacks on October 7, 2023, resulted in catastrophic atrocities, and marked the beginning of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. The overwhelming coverage by mainstream and social media, characterized by extreme details and graphic images, vividly transported viewers to the horrifying scene. It remains unclear to what extent such indirect exposure influences the occurrence of stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms. We analyzed data from a three-year prospective study in which 4,797 participants received smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires, supplemented by a nationwide clinical survey with 2,536 participants. Among the participants not directly exposed, we estimated PTSD prevalence to be 22.9-36.0% and moderate to severe anxiety prevalence to be 22.9-55.32%, with 752,057 daily questionnaires before and after October 7 further indicating higher stress levels than those reported in previous events, including political disputes, the COVID-19 pandemic, and past armed conflicts. The occurrences of PTSD and anxiety are well explained by increased and persistent news consumption, and especially by the availability of gory videos on social media. Continuous monitoring of participants via smartwatches and daily questionnaires further revealed considerable differences in stress, mood, step counts, sleep quality, and duration in the first week after the October 7 events among those who later developed PTSD. This study demonstrates the unprecedented amplifying effect of mass media on mental health in terror and war settings and highlights the potential of continuous monitoring for early detection and prompt treatment of those in need.</p>
