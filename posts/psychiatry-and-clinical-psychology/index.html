A.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294462\nBackground: Differences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (Watch) or detaching themselves (Distance). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously. Results: FNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, np2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, np2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, np2: \u003c0.001-0.015). Conclusions: Emotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.\nModeling brain sex in the limbic system as phenotype for female-prevalent mental disorders\nAuthors: Matte Bon, G.; Kraft, D.; Comasco, E.; Derntl, B.; Kaufmann, T.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294165\nBackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics. MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample. ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model. ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders. HighlightsO_LIWe assessed sex differences and heritability of limbic and non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LILimbic volumes showed stronger sex differences and higher heritability overall. C_LIO_LIWe trained brain sex classification models on limbic or non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LIPerformance was high and the sex class probabilities were heritable for all models. C_LIO_LIIn females, limbic estimates were associated with depression diagnosis. C_LI Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.\nPredicting the onset of internalizing disorders in early adolescence using deep learning optimized with AI\nAuthors: de Lacy, N.; Ramshaw, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294377\nInternalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder) are among the most common mental health conditions that can substantially reduce daily life function. Early adolescence is an important developmental stage for the increase in prevalence of internalizing disorders and understanding specific factors that predict their onset may be germane to intervention and prevention strategies. We analyzed [~]6,000 candidate predictors from multiple knowledge domains (cognitive, psychosocial, neural, biological) contributed by children of late elementary school age (9-10 yrs) and their parents in the ABCD cohort to construct individual-level models predicting the later (11-12 yrs) onset of depression, anxiety and somatic symptom disorder using deep learning with artificial neural networks. Deep learning was guided by an evolutionary algorithm that jointly performed optimization across hyperparameters and automated feature selection, allowing more candidate predictors and a wider variety of predictor types to be analyzed than the largest previous comparable machine learning studies. We found that the future onset of internalizing disorders could be robustly predicted in early adolescence with AUROCs [\u0026ge;][~]0.90 and [\u0026ge;][~]80% accuracy. Each disorder had a specific set of predictors, though parent problem behavioral traits and sleep disturbances represented cross-cutting themes. Additional computational experiments revealed that psychosocial predictors were more important to predicting early adolescent internalizing disorders than cognitive, neural or biological factors and generated models with better performance. We also observed that the accuracy of individual-level models was highly correlated to the relative importance of their constituent predictors, suggesting that principled searches for predictors with higher importance or effect sizes could support the construction of more accurate individual-level models of internalizing disorders. Future work, including replication in additional datasets, will help test the generalizability of our findings and explore their application to other stages in human development and mental health conditions.\nFunctional Connectivity and Complexity Analyses of Resting-State fMRI in Pre-Adolescents with ADHD\nAuthors: Zhang, R.; Murray, S. B.; Duval, C. J.; Wang, D. J. J.; Jann, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294136\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been characterized by impairments among distributed functional brain networks, e.g., the frontoparietal network (FPN), default mode network (DMN), and reward and motivation-related circuits (RMN). In the current study, we evaluated the complexity and functional connectivity (FC) of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in pre-adolescents with ADHD for pathology-relevant networks. We leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The final study sample included 63 children with ADHD and 92 healthy control children matched on age, sex, and pubertal development status. For selected regions in relevant networks, ANCOVA compared multiscale entropy (MSE) and FC between the groups. Finally, differences in the association between MSE and FC were evaluated. We found significantly reduced MSE along with increased FC within the FPN of pre-adolescents with ADHD compared to matched healthy controls. Significant partial correlations between MSE and FC emerged in fewer regions in the participants with ADHD than in the controls. The observation of reduced entropy is consistent with existing literature using rsfMRI and other neuroimaging modalities. The current findings of complexity and FC in ADHD support hypotheses of altered function of inhibitory control networks in ADHD.\nMDMA Assisted Psychotherapy Decreases PTSD Symptoms, Dissociation, Functional Disability, and Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Green, W. M.; Raut, S. B.; James, F. L. J.; Benedek, D. M.; Ursano, R. J.; Johnson, L. R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23293955\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.\nRemote monitoring of depression severity: A machine learning approach\nAuthors: Holstein, V. L.; Rahimi-Eichi, H.; Emden, D.; Gutfleisch, L.; Refisch, A.; Goltermann, J.; Leenings, R.; Winter, N. R.; Kircher, T.; Nenadic, I.; Redlich, R.; Leehr, E. J.; Dohm, K.; Baker, J. T.; Dannlowski, U.; Opel, N.; Hahn, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294431\nDepression is a widely prevalent psychiatric illness with variable levels of severity that necessitate different approaches to treatment. To enhance the management of this condition, there is a growing interest in utilizing mobile devices, especially smartphones, for remote monitoring of patients. This study aims to build prediction models for depression severity based on active and passive features collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of depression severity. Using data from 142 participants (85 healthy controls, 67 MDD) we extracted features such as GPS-derived mobility markers, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), age, and sex to develop machine learning models of depression severity on the different diagnostic subgroups in this cohort. Our results indicate that the employed models outperformed baseline estimators in random split scenarios. However, the improvement was marginal in user-split scenarios, highlighting the need for larger and more diverse samples for clinical utility. Among the features, mood EMA emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by GPS-derived mobility features. Models also showed a significant association between depression severity and average reported mood, as well as GPS-derived mobility markers such as number of places visited and percent home. While predicting composite depression scores is important, future studies could explore predicting individual symptom items or symptom groups for a more comprehensive assessment of depression severity. Challenges for clinical utility include participant dropout, which could be addressed through more engaging app design to promote user adherence. Harmonization of phone-derived measures is also crucial to facilitate model transfer across studies. In conclusion, this study contributes valuable evidence supporting the potential utility of smartphone data for mood state monitoring and predicting depression severity. Future research should focus on predicting depression further ahead in time and addressing the challenges identified to create more robust and effective depression monitoring solutions using smartphone-based data.\nIdentifying selective predictors of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant and Conduct Disorder onset in early adolescence with optimized deep learning\nAuthors: de Lacy, N.; Ramshaw, M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.23294322\nIntroductionThe externalizing disorders of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) exhibit a strong uptick in incidence in late childhood to become some of the most common mental health conditions in adolescence and strong predictors of adult psychopathology. While treatable, substantial diagnostic overlap exists among the externalizing disorders, complicating intervention planning. Thus, early adolescence is a period of considerable interest in understanding which factors predict the onset of externalizing disorders and disambiguating those that may differentially predict the development of ADD versus (vs) ODD and CD. Materials and MethodsHere, we analyzed 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors collected from children age 9-10 yrs and their parents in the ABCD cohort spanning demographics; developmental and medical history; physiologic function; academic performance; social, physical and cultural environment; activities of everyday life, substance use and cortical and subcortical brain structure, volumetrics, connectivity and function to predict the future onset of ADHD, ODD and CD at 2-year follow-up. We used deep learning optimized with an innovative AI algorithm that jointly optimizes model training and performs automated feature selection to construct prospective, individual-level predictions of illness onset in this high-dimension data. Additional experiments furnished predictive models of all prevailing cases at 11-12 yrs and examined relative predictive performance when candidate predictors were restricted to only neural metrics derived from MRI. ResultsMultimodal models achieved strong, consistent performance with [~]86-97% accuracy, 0.919-0.996 AUROC and [~]82-97% precision and recall in testing in held-out, unseen data. In neural-only models, predictive performance dropped substantially but nonetheless accuracy and AUROC of [~]80% were achieved. Parent aggressive and externalizing traits uniquely differentiated the onset of ODD while structural MRI metrics in the limbic system specifically predicted the onset of CD. Psychosocial measures of sleep disorders, parent mental health and behavioral traits and school performance proved valuable across all disorders but cognitive and non-neural physiologic metrics were never selected. In neural-only models, structural and functional MRI metrics in subcortical regions and cortical-subcortical connectivity were emphasized over task fMRI or diffusion measures. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between accuracy and final predictor importance. ConclusionsDeep learning optimized with AI can generate highly accurate individual-level predictions of the onset of early adolescent externalizing disorders using multimodal features. Analysis of 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors highlighted psychosocial predictors related to sleep disorders, school performance and parent mental health and behavioral traits over other feature types. While externalizing disorders are frequently co-morbid in adolescents, certain predictors appeared specific to the onset of ODD or CD vs ADHD with structural MRI metrics in the limbic system offering particular promise in identifying children at risk for the onset of CD, a highly disabling disorder. The strong observed correlation between predictive accuracy and final predictor importance suggests that principled, data-driven searches for impactful predictors may facilitate the construction of robust, individual-level models in high-dimension data. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning study to predict the onset of all three major adolescent externalizing disorders with the same design and participant cohort to enable direct comparisons, analyze \u003e200 multimodal features and include as many types of neuroimaging metrics. Future work to test our observations in external validation data will help further test the generalizability of these findings.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Differences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored. Methods: Individuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (Watch) or detaching themselves (Distance). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously. Results: FNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, np2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, np2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, np2: &lt;0.001-0.015). Conclusions: Emotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics.

MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample.

ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model.

ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.

Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder) are among the most common mental health conditions that can substantially reduce daily life function. Early adolescence is an important developmental stage for the increase in prevalence of internalizing disorders and understanding specific factors that predict their onset may be germane to intervention and prevention strategies. We analyzed [~]6,000 candidate predictors from multiple knowledge domains (cognitive, psychosocial, neural, biological) contributed by children of late elementary school age (9-10 yrs) and their parents in the ABCD cohort to construct individual-level models predicting the later (11-12 yrs) onset of depression, anxiety and somatic symptom disorder using deep learning with artificial neural networks. Deep learning was guided by an evolutionary algorithm that jointly performed optimization across hyperparameters and automated feature selection, allowing more candidate predictors and a wider variety of predictor types to be analyzed than the largest previous comparable machine learning studies. We found that the future onset of internalizing disorders could be robustly predicted in early adolescence with AUROCs [&amp;ge;][~]0.90 and [&amp;ge;][~]80% accuracy. Each disorder had a specific set of predictors, though parent problem behavioral traits and sleep disturbances represented cross-cutting themes. Additional computational experiments revealed that psychosocial predictors were more important to predicting early adolescent internalizing disorders than cognitive, neural or biological factors and generated models with better performance. We also observed that the accuracy of individual-level models was highly correlated to the relative importance of their constituent predictors, suggesting that principled searches for predictors with higher importance or effect sizes could support the construction of more accurate individual-level models of internalizing disorders. Future work, including replication in additional datasets, will help test the generalizability of our findings and explore their application to other stages in human development and mental health conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been characterized by impairments among distributed functional brain networks, e.g., the frontoparietal network (FPN), default mode network (DMN), and reward and motivation-related circuits (RMN). In the current study, we evaluated the complexity and functional connectivity (FC) of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in pre-adolescents with ADHD for pathology-relevant networks.

We leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The final study sample included 63 children with ADHD and 92 healthy control children matched on age, sex, and pubertal development status. For selected regions in relevant networks, ANCOVA compared multiscale entropy (MSE) and FC between the groups. Finally, differences in the association between MSE and FC were evaluated.

We found significantly reduced MSE along with increased FC within the FPN of pre-adolescents with ADHD compared to matched healthy controls. Significant partial correlations between MSE and FC emerged in fewer regions in the participants with ADHD than in the controls.

The observation of reduced entropy is consistent with existing literature using rsfMRI and other neuroimaging modalities. The current findings of complexity and FC in ADHD support hypotheses of altered function of inhibitory control networks in ADHD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Depression is a widely prevalent psychiatric illness with variable levels of severity that necessitate different approaches to treatment. To enhance the management of this condition, there is a growing interest in utilizing mobile devices, especially smartphones, for remote monitoring of patients. This study aims to build prediction models for depression severity based on active and passive features collected from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring of depression severity. Using data from 142 participants (85 healthy controls, 67 MDD) we extracted features such as GPS-derived mobility markers, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), age, and sex to develop machine learning models of depression severity on the different diagnostic subgroups in this cohort. Our results indicate that the employed models outperformed baseline estimators in random split scenarios. However, the improvement was marginal in user-split scenarios, highlighting the need for larger and more diverse samples for clinical utility. Among the features, mood EMA emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by GPS-derived mobility features. Models also showed a significant association between depression severity and average reported mood, as well as GPS-derived mobility markers such as number of places visited and percent home. While predicting composite depression scores is important, future studies could explore predicting individual symptom items or symptom groups for a more comprehensive assessment of depression severity. Challenges for clinical utility include participant dropout, which could be addressed through more engaging app design to promote user adherence. Harmonization of phone-derived measures is also crucial to facilitate model transfer across studies. In conclusion, this study contributes valuable evidence supporting the potential utility of smartphone data for mood state monitoring and predicting depression severity. Future research should focus on predicting depression further ahead in time and addressing the challenges identified to create more robust and effective depression monitoring solutions using smartphone-based data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionThe externalizing disorders of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) exhibit a strong uptick in incidence in late childhood to become some of the most common mental health conditions in adolescence and strong predictors of adult psychopathology. While treatable, substantial diagnostic overlap exists among the externalizing disorders, complicating intervention planning. Thus, early adolescence is a period of considerable interest in understanding which factors predict the onset of externalizing disorders and disambiguating those that may differentially predict the development of ADD versus (vs) ODD and CD.

Materials and MethodsHere, we analyzed 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors collected from children age 9-10 yrs and their parents in the ABCD cohort spanning demographics; developmental and medical history; physiologic function; academic performance; social, physical and cultural environment; activities of everyday life, substance use and cortical and subcortical brain structure, volumetrics, connectivity and function to predict the future onset of ADHD, ODD and CD at 2-year follow-up. We used deep learning optimized with an innovative AI algorithm that jointly optimizes model training and performs automated feature selection to construct prospective, individual-level predictions of illness onset in this high-dimension data. Additional experiments furnished predictive models of all prevailing cases at 11-12 yrs and examined relative predictive performance when candidate predictors were restricted to only neural metrics derived from MRI.

ResultsMultimodal models achieved strong, consistent performance with [~]86-97% accuracy, 0.919-0.996 AUROC and [~]82-97% precision and recall in testing in held-out, unseen data. In neural-only models, predictive performance dropped substantially but nonetheless accuracy and AUROC of [~]80% were achieved. Parent aggressive and externalizing traits uniquely differentiated the onset of ODD while structural MRI metrics in the limbic system specifically predicted the onset of CD. Psychosocial measures of sleep disorders, parent mental health and behavioral traits and school performance proved valuable across all disorders but cognitive and non-neural physiologic metrics were never selected. In neural-only models, structural and functional MRI metrics in subcortical regions and cortical-subcortical connectivity were emphasized over task fMRI or diffusion measures. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between accuracy and final predictor importance.

ConclusionsDeep learning optimized with AI can generate highly accurate individual-level predictions of the onset of early adolescent externalizing disorders using multimodal features. Analysis of 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors highlighted psychosocial predictors related to sleep disorders, school performance and parent mental health and behavioral traits over other feature types. While externalizing disorders are frequently co-morbid in adolescents, certain predictors appeared specific to the onset of ODD or CD vs ADHD with structural MRI metrics in the limbic system offering particular promise in identifying children at risk for the onset of CD, a highly disabling disorder. The strong observed correlation between predictive accuracy and final predictor importance suggests that principled, data-driven searches for impactful predictors may facilitate the construction of robust, individual-level models in high-dimension data. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning study to predict the onset of all three major adolescent externalizing disorders with the same design and participant cohort to enable direct comparisons, analyze &gt;200 multimodal features and include as many types of neuroimaging metrics. Future work to test our observations in external validation data will help further test the generalizability of these findings.</p>
