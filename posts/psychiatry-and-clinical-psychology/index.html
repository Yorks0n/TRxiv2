These two perspectives map onto the ways in which executive function is measured in childhood - using either structured laboratory tasks or ratings of everyday behaviours. Differences in executive functioning are associated with neurodevelopmental differences, but evidence for associations between specific profiles of executive function and specific neurodevelopmental conditions is mixed. In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify common profiles of executive function in a transdiagnostic sample of 566 neurodivergent children, using both performance and rating-based measures of executive function. Three profiles of executive function were identified: one had consistent difficulties across both types of assessments, while the other two had inconsistent profiles of predominantly rating- or predominantly task-based difficulties. Children with these different profiles had differences in academic achievement and mental health outcomes and could further be differentiated from a comparison group of neurotypical children on both shared and profile-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Importantly, childrens executive function profiles were not directly related to diagnostic categories or to dimensions of neurodiversity associated with specific diagnoses (e.g., hyperactivity, inattention, social communication). These findings support the idea that there are separate domains of executive function and that the two types of assessment tapping these functions are dissociable and provide non-redundant information related to neurodevelopmental differences. These findings advance our understanding of executive function profiles in neurodivergent populations and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neural variation.\nLSD increases sleep duration the night after microdosing\nAuthors: Allen, N.; Jeremiah, A.; Murphy, R.; Sumner, R.; Forsyth, A.; Hoeh, N.; Menkes, D.; Evans, W.; Muthukumaraswamy, S.; Sundram, F.; Roop, P.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291970\nMicrodosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nThe association between childhood income and mental health: can sibling comparison designs help resolve this research question?\nAuthors: Ejlskov, L.; Esen, B. O.; Hakulinen, C.; Weye, N.; Formanek, T.; McGrath, J. J.; Pedersen, C. B.; Plana-Ripoll, O.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291796\nBackground In previous studies, null results from sibling comparison designs have been used to infer that no causal association exists between childhood family income and subsequent risk of mental disorders. The aim of our study is to replicate the findings from previous studies and propose three alternative explanations based on i) variability in income and mental health between siblings, ii) life course models, and iii) detailed descriptive statistics. Methods We followed a nationwide Danish cohort born from 1986 to 1996 (n = 643,814, including 404,179 siblings) from age 15 until diagnosis of severe mental disorders or censoring. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated between childhood family income and subsequent mental disorders, accompanied by comprehensive descriptive statistics and triangulation analyses that help in interpreting the findings. Results We observed an association between a $15,000 increase in family income and severe mental disorders (0.78; 0.76-0.81), but the sibling comparison design showed null results (1.02; 0.94-1.11). Siblings were typically born three years apart, with a difference in monthly average income at age 14 of $496 (interquartile range: $150-$641). A pseudo-sibling cohort also indicated null results (0.93; 0.85-1.01), although siblings were not family members. Family income measured yearly demonstrated comparable estimates across ages 1-14 (from 0.67 to 0.82). Conclusion Our investigation suggests that the null associations between childhood income and mental health estimated through sibling comparison designs may be explained by the fact that siblings are close together in age and residing within the same family income environment with only minor income fluctuations. Additionally, a sibling comparison design is useful to test a critical/sensitive period, but our analyses suggest that no age posits a critical risk age for this research question. This raises caution on the current practice of relying on sibling comparison designs to estimate the association between childhood income and mental health.\nThe Role of VSL#3 in the Treatment of Fatigue and Other Symptoms in Long Covid-19 Syndrome: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study (DELong#3)\nAuthors: Caprioli, F.; Marinoni, B.; Rimondi, A.; Bottaro, F.; Ciafardini, C.; Amoroso, C.; Muia, M.; Caridi, B.; Noviello, D.; Bandera, A.; Gori, A.; Mantero, M.; Blasi, F.; Ferrucci, R.; Facciotti, F.; Vecchi, M.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.23291986\nLong COVID, also known as Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), is a chronic condition affecting individuals who have recovered from acute COVID-19. It is currently estimated that around 65 million people worldwide suffer from Long COVID. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, exertion intolerance, neurocognitive and sensory impairment, sleep disturbance, myalgia/arthralgia, and dysautonomia. Among them fatigue has emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life and daily functioning of Long COVID patients. Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Dysbiosis persists even after several months of recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on this evidence, we carried out a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of VSL#3(R), a consortium of probiotic bacterial strains, in reducing fatigue and improving various aspects of patients well-being in patients with Long COVID syndrome.

I.; Simpson-Kent, I.; van Harmelen, A.-L.; Vertes, P. E.; Bullmore, E. T.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291420\nChildhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.\nEstimating the impact of transmitted and non-transmitted psychiatric and neurodevelopmental polygenic scores on youth emotional problems.\nAuthors: Shakeshaft, A.; Martin, J.; Dennison, C. A.; Riglin, L.; Lewis, C. M.; O'Donovan, M. C.; Thapar, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291893\nAnxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.\nRandomized Trial of Ketamine Masked by Surgical Anesthesia in Depressed Patients\nAuthors: Lii, T. R.; Smith, A. E.; Flohr, J. R.; Okada, R. L.; Nyongesa, C. A.; Cianfichi, L. J.; Hack, L. M.; Schatzberg, A. F.; Heifets, B. D.\nScore: 358.4, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.28.23289210\nBACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials. METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([\u0026ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received. RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration. CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

MethodsTo fill this gap, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study explored chronic oxytocin administration effects on endogenous salivary oxytocin levels and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA methylation) in 8-to-12-year-old children with ASD (n = 79, 16 females). Biological sampling was performed at baseline (pre-treatment), immediately (24 hours) after the four-week oxytocin administration period (12 IU, twice daily) and at a follow-up session, four weeks after the last nasal spray administration. ResultsCompared to placebo, children receiving the oxytocin nasal spray displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at the four-week follow up session. Regarding epigenetics, oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR methylation were observed, reflecting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment. ConclusionFour weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with ASD, as evidenced by increased salivary oxytocin levels and reduced OXTR DNA methylation (indicating increased receptor expression).\nAdverse childhood experiences and recent negative events activate immune and growth factor pathways, which are associated with first episode major depression and suicidal behaviours\nAuthors: Almulla, A. F.; Abo Algon, A. A.; Maes, M. F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291597\nBackgroundAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Negative Life Events (NLEs) may activate immune-inflammatory pathways, which play a role in the onset of Major Depressive Disorder and its severe phenotype Major Dysmood disorder (MDMD). ObjectivesTo assess if elevated ACEs and NLEs in first episode (FE)-MDMD predict activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), chemokines, and growth factors that participate in the pathophysiology of MDMD. MethodsThis research assessed the effects of ACEs and NLEs on forty-eight cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, in 71 FE-MDMD patients and forty heathy controls. ResultsACEs are highly significantly associated with the classical M1 macrophage, T helper (Th)-1, Th-1 polarization, IRS, and neurotoxicity immune profiles, and not with the alternative M2, and Th-2 immune profiles. There are highly significant correlations between ACEs and NLEs and different cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, especially with interleukin (IL)-16, CCL27, stem cell growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 62.3% of the variance in the depression phenome (based on severity of depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviors) was explained by the regression on IL-4 (p=0.001, inversely), the sum of ACEs + NLEs (p\u003c0.0001), and a vector extracted from 10 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (p\u003c0.0001; both positively associated). The latter partially mediated (p\u003c0.0001) the effects of ACE + NLEs on the depression phenome. ConclusionsPart of the effects of ACEs and NLEs on the depression phenome is mediated via activation of immune and growth factor networks. These pathways have a stronger impact in subjects with lowered activities of the compensatory immune-regulatory system.\nInstability in longitudinal sleep duration predicts cognitive impairment in aged participants of the Seattle Longitudinal Study\nAuthors: Keil, S. A.; Schindler, A.; Wang, M. X.; Piantino, J.; Silbert, L. C.; Elliott, J. E.; Lim, M.; Thomas, R. G.; Willis, S.; Iliff, J. J.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.23291098\nImportance. Sleep disturbances and clinical sleep disorders are associated with all-cause dementia and neurodegenerative conditions. It remains unclear how longitudinal changes in sleep impact the incidence of cognitive impairment. Objective. To evaluate how longitudinal sleep patterns contribute to age-related changes in cognitive function in healthy adults. Design, Setting, Participants. This study utilizes retrospective longitudinal analyses of a community-based study within Seattle, evaluating self-reported sleep (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in aged adults. Main Outcomes and Measures. The main outcome is cognitive impairment as defined by sub-threshold performance on 2 of 4 neuropsychological batteries: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Trail Making Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale (Revised). Sleep duration was defined through self-report of average nightly sleep duration over the last week and assessed longitudinally. Median sleep duration, change in sleep duration (slope), variability in sleep duration (standard deviation, Sleep Variability), and sleep phenotype (\"Short Sleep\" median [\u0026le;]7hrs.; \"Medium Sleep\" median = 7hrs; \"Long Sleep\" median [\u0026ge;]7hrs.). Results. A total of 822 individuals (mean age of 76.2 years [11.8]; 466 women [56.7%]; 216 APOE allele positive [26.3%]) were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression model (concordance 0.70) showed that increased Sleep Variability (95% CI [1.27,3.86]) was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. Further analysis using linear regression prediction analysis (R2=0.201, F (10, 168)=6.010, p=2.67E-07) showed that high Sleep Variability ({beta}=0.3491; p=0.048) was a significant predictor of cognitive impairment over a 10-year period. Conclusions and Relevance. High variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment and predictive of decline in cognitive performance ten years later. These data highlight that instability in longitudinal sleep duration may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Executive functions can be conceptualised as either a set of higher-order cognitive skills that enable us to engage in flexible thinking and regulate our thoughts and behaviours, or as the ability to integrate knowledge, beliefs, and values when applying cognitive control in everyday situations. These two perspectives map onto the ways in which executive function is measured in childhood - using either structured laboratory tasks or ratings of everyday behaviours. Differences in executive functioning are associated with neurodevelopmental differences, but evidence for associations between specific profiles of executive function and specific neurodevelopmental conditions is mixed. In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify common profiles of executive function in a transdiagnostic sample of 566 neurodivergent children, using both performance and rating-based measures of executive function. Three profiles of executive function were identified: one had consistent difficulties across both types of assessments, while the other two had inconsistent profiles of predominantly rating- or predominantly task-based difficulties. Children with these different profiles had differences in academic achievement and mental health outcomes and could further be differentiated from a comparison group of neurotypical children on both shared and profile-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Importantly, childrens executive function profiles were not directly related to diagnostic categories or to dimensions of neurodiversity associated with specific diagnoses (e.g., hyperactivity, inattention, social communication). These findings support the idea that there are separate domains of executive function and that the two types of assessment tapping these functions are dissociable and provide non-redundant information related to neurodevelopmental differences. These findings advance our understanding of executive function profiles in neurodivergent populations and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neural variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microdosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background In previous studies, null results from sibling comparison designs have been used to infer that no causal association exists between childhood family income and subsequent risk of mental disorders. The aim of our study is to replicate the findings from previous studies and propose three alternative explanations based on i) variability in income and mental health between siblings, ii) life course models, and iii) detailed descriptive statistics. Methods We followed a nationwide Danish cohort born from 1986 to 1996 (n = 643,814, including 404,179 siblings) from age 15 until diagnosis of severe mental disorders or censoring. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated between childhood family income and subsequent mental disorders, accompanied by comprehensive descriptive statistics and triangulation analyses that help in interpreting the findings. Results We observed an association between a $15,000 increase in family income and severe mental disorders (0.78; 0.76-0.81), but the sibling comparison design showed null results (1.02; 0.94-1.11). Siblings were typically born three years apart, with a difference in monthly average income at age 14 of $496 (interquartile range: $150-$641). A pseudo-sibling cohort also indicated null results (0.93; 0.85-1.01), although siblings were not family members. Family income measured yearly demonstrated comparable estimates across ages 1-14 (from 0.67 to 0.82). Conclusion Our investigation suggests that the null associations between childhood income and mental health estimated through sibling comparison designs may be explained by the fact that siblings are close together in age and residing within the same family income environment with only minor income fluctuations. Additionally, a sibling comparison design is useful to test a critical/sensitive period, but our analyses suggest that no age posits a critical risk age for this research question. This raises caution on the current practice of relying on sibling comparison designs to estimate the association between childhood income and mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long COVID, also known as Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), is a chronic condition affecting individuals who have recovered from acute COVID-19. It is currently estimated that around 65 million people worldwide suffer from Long COVID. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, exertion intolerance, neurocognitive and sensory impairment, sleep disturbance, myalgia/arthralgia, and dysautonomia. Among them fatigue has emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life and daily functioning of Long COVID patients. Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Dysbiosis persists even after several months of recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Based on this evidence, we carried out a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of VSL#3(R), a consortium of probiotic bacterial strains, in reducing fatigue and improving various aspects of patients well-being in patients with Long COVID syndrome.

        <p class="abstract">Childhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials.

METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([&amp;ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received.

RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration.

CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundClinical efficacy of chronic intranasal administration of oxytocin is increasingly explored in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but to date, little is known regarding its biological effects and in particular how chronic administration regimes impact endogenous oxytocinergic function.

MethodsTo fill this gap, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study explored chronic oxytocin administration effects on endogenous salivary oxytocin levels and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA methylation) in 8-to-12-year-old children with ASD (n = 79, 16 females). Biological sampling was performed at baseline (pre-treatment), immediately (24 hours) after the four-week oxytocin administration period (12 IU, twice daily) and at a follow-up session, four weeks after the last nasal spray administration.

ResultsCompared to placebo, children receiving the oxytocin nasal spray displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at the four-week follow up session. Regarding epigenetics, oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR methylation were observed, reflecting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment.

ConclusionFour weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with ASD, as evidenced by increased salivary oxytocin levels and reduced OXTR DNA methylation (indicating increased receptor expression).</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Negative Life Events (NLEs) may activate immune-inflammatory pathways, which play a role in the onset of Major Depressive Disorder and its severe phenotype Major Dysmood disorder (MDMD).

ObjectivesTo assess if elevated ACEs and NLEs in first episode (FE)-MDMD predict activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), chemokines, and growth factors that participate in the pathophysiology of MDMD.

MethodsThis research assessed the effects of ACEs and NLEs on forty-eight cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, in 71 FE-MDMD patients and forty heathy controls.

ResultsACEs are highly significantly associated with the classical M1 macrophage, T helper (Th)-1, Th-1 polarization, IRS, and neurotoxicity immune profiles, and not with the alternative M2, and Th-2 immune profiles. There are highly significant correlations between ACEs and NLEs and different cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, especially with interleukin (IL)-16, CCL27, stem cell growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 62.3% of the variance in the depression phenome (based on severity of depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviors) was explained by the regression on IL-4 (p=0.001, inversely), the sum of ACEs &#43; NLEs (p&lt;0.0001), and a vector extracted from 10 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (p&lt;0.0001; both positively associated). The latter partially mediated (p&lt;0.0001) the effects of ACE &#43; NLEs on the depression phenome.

ConclusionsPart of the effects of ACEs and NLEs on the depression phenome is mediated via activation of immune and growth factor networks. These pathways have a stronger impact in subjects with lowered activities of the compensatory immune-regulatory system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Importance. Sleep disturbances and clinical sleep disorders are associated with all-cause dementia and neurodegenerative conditions. It remains unclear how longitudinal changes in sleep impact the incidence of cognitive impairment.

Objective. To evaluate how longitudinal sleep patterns contribute to age-related changes in cognitive function in healthy adults.

Design, Setting, Participants. This study utilizes retrospective longitudinal analyses of a community-based study within Seattle, evaluating self-reported sleep (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in aged adults.

Main Outcomes and Measures. The main outcome is cognitive impairment as defined by sub-threshold performance on 2 of 4 neuropsychological batteries: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Trail Making Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale (Revised). Sleep duration was defined through self-report of  average nightly sleep duration over the last week and assessed longitudinally. Median sleep duration, change in sleep duration (slope), variability in sleep duration (standard deviation, Sleep Variability), and sleep phenotype (&#34;Short Sleep&#34; median [&amp;le;]7hrs.; &#34;Medium Sleep&#34; median = 7hrs; &#34;Long Sleep&#34; median [&amp;ge;]7hrs.).

Results. A total of 822 individuals (mean age of 76.2 years [11.8]; 466 women [56.7%]; 216 APOE allele positive [26.3%]) were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression model (concordance 0.70) showed that increased Sleep Variability (95% CI [1.27,3.86]) was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. Further analysis using linear regression prediction analysis (R2=0.201, F (10, 168)=6.010, p=2.67E-07) showed that high Sleep Variability ({beta}=0.3491; p=0.048) was a significant predictor of cognitive impairment over a 10-year period.

Conclusions and Relevance. High variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment and predictive of decline in cognitive performance ten years later. These data highlight that instability in longitudinal sleep duration may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.</p>
