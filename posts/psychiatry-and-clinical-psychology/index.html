While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined. MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk. FindingsRelative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 13{middle dot}77 (95% CI 8{middle dot}52-20{middle dot}91) when adjusted for age at birth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1{middle dot}88 [95% CI 0{middle dot}74-3{middle dot}82]). In full siblings, the relative recurrence risk for severe postpartum psychosis requiring inpatient diagnosis was even higher than the risk for inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (18{middle dot}13 [95% CI 11{middle dot}12-27{middle dot}57]). InterpretationIncreased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings is likely due to a combination of genetic factors and shared environment. The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.\nClassifying autism in a clinical population based on motion synchrony: a proof-of-concept study using real-life diagnostic interviews\nAuthors: Koehler, J. C.; Dong, M. S.; Song, D.-Y.; Bong, G.; Koutsouleris, N.; Yoo, H.; Falter-Wagner, C. M.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293186\nPredictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.\nReactivation of herpesvirus type-6 and IgA/IgM-mediated responses to activin-A underpin Long COVID, including affective symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome.\nAuthors: Vojdani, A.; Almulla, A. F.; Zhou, B.; Al-Hakeim, H. F.; Maes, M.\nScore: 54.1, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.23.23293046\nAbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPersistent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reactivation of dormant viruses, and immune-oxidative responses are involved in Long COVID. ObjectivesTo investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers. MethodsWe examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). ResultsLong COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709). ConclusionReactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.\nStimulant medication use and apparent cortical thickness development in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a prospective longitudinal study\nAuthors: van der Pal, Z.; Walhovd, K. B.; Amlien, I. K.; Guichelaar, C. J.; Kaiser, A.; Bottelier, M. A.; Geurts, H. M.; Reneman, L.; Schrantee, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.23293202\nBackgroundStimulant medication is commonly prescribed as treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While we previously found that short-term stimulant-treatment influences apparent cortical thickness development in an age-dependent manner, it remains unknown whether these effects persist throughout development into adulthood. PurposeInvestigate the long-term age-dependent effects of stimulant medication on apparent cortical thickness development in adolescents and adults previously diagnosed with ADHD. MethodsThis prospective study included the baseline and 4-year follow-up assessment of the \"effects of Psychotropic drugs On the Developing brain-MPH\" (\"ePOD-MPH\") project, conducted between June-1-2011 and December-28-2019. The analyses were pre-registered (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/32BHF). T1-weighted MR scans were obtained from male adolescents and adults, and cortical thickness was estimated for predefined regions of interest (ROIs) using Freesurfer. We determined medication use and assessed symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression at both time points. Linear mixed models were constructed to assess main effects and interactions of stimulant medication use, time, and age group on regional apparent cortical thickness. ResultsA total of 32 male adolescents (aged mean{+/-}SD, 11.2{+/-}0.9 at baseline) and 24 men (aged mean{+/-}SD, 29.9{+/-}5.0 at baseline) were included that previously participated in the ePOD-MPH project. We found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant medication use on ROI apparent cortical thickness. As expected, we did find age-by-time interaction effects in all ROIs (left prefrontal ROI: P=.002, right medial and posterior ROIs: P\u003c.001), reflecting reductions in apparent cortical thickness in adolescents. Additionally, ADHD symptom severity (adolescents: P\u003c.001, adults: P=.001) and anxiety symptoms (adolescents: P=0.03) were reduced, and lower change in ADHD symptoms was associated with higher medication use in adults (P=0.001). ConclusionWe found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant-treatment for ADHD on apparent cortical thickness development in adolescents and adults. The identified age-dependent differences in apparent cortical thickness development are consistent with existing literature on typical cortical development. Summary statementThis prospective longitudinal study in male adolescents and adults found that stimulant medication does not modulate long-term apparent cortical thickness development. Key resultsO_LIIn this prospective longitudinal structural MRI study of 32 male adolescents and 24 men previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant medication on apparent cortical thickness development. C_LIO_LIWe identified age-dependent patterns of cortical development, with reductions in apparent cortical thickness in adolescents only (P\u003c.001 in all regions of interest).

M.; Schurmann Vignaga, S.; Prado, P.; Figueras, R.; Lizaso, L.; Gonzalez-Gadea, M. L.; Manes, F.; Cetkovich, M.; Pallavicini, C.; Torralva, T.; de la Fuente, L. A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292384\nBackgroundCocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b. MethodsWe examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks. ResultsAt the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down. ConclusionsDifferent routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPostpartum psychosis, a mood disorder triggered by childbirth, is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined.

MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk.

FindingsRelative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 13{middle dot}77 (95% CI 8{middle dot}52-20{middle dot}91) when adjusted for age at birth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1{middle dot}88 [95% CI 0{middle dot}74-3{middle dot}82]). In full siblings, the relative recurrence risk for severe postpartum psychosis requiring inpatient diagnosis was even higher than the risk for inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (18{middle dot}13 [95% CI 11{middle dot}12-27{middle dot}57]).

InterpretationIncreased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings is likely due to a combination of genetic factors and shared environment. The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPersistent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reactivation of dormant viruses, and immune-oxidative responses are involved in Long COVID.

ObjectivesTo investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers.

MethodsWe examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5&#39;-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR).

ResultsLong COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709).

ConclusionReactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStimulant medication is commonly prescribed as treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While we previously found that short-term stimulant-treatment influences apparent cortical thickness development in an age-dependent manner, it remains unknown whether these effects persist throughout development into adulthood.

PurposeInvestigate the long-term age-dependent effects of stimulant medication on apparent cortical thickness development in adolescents and adults previously diagnosed with ADHD.

MethodsThis prospective study included the baseline and 4-year follow-up assessment of the &#34;effects of Psychotropic drugs On the Developing brain-MPH&#34; (&#34;ePOD-MPH&#34;) project, conducted between June-1-2011 and December-28-2019. The analyses were pre-registered (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/32BHF). T1-weighted MR scans were obtained from male adolescents and adults, and cortical thickness was estimated for predefined regions of interest (ROIs) using Freesurfer. We determined medication use and assessed symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression at both time points. Linear mixed models were constructed to assess main effects and interactions of stimulant medication use, time, and age group on regional apparent cortical thickness.

ResultsA total of 32 male adolescents (aged mean{&#43;/-}SD, 11.2{&#43;/-}0.9 at baseline) and 24 men (aged mean{&#43;/-}SD, 29.9{&#43;/-}5.0 at baseline) were included that previously participated in the ePOD-MPH project. We found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant medication use on ROI apparent cortical thickness. As expected, we did find age-by-time interaction effects in all ROIs (left prefrontal ROI: P=.002, right medial and posterior ROIs: P&lt;.001), reflecting reductions in apparent cortical thickness in adolescents. Additionally, ADHD symptom severity (adolescents: P&lt;.001, adults: P=.001) and anxiety symptoms (adolescents: P=0.03) were reduced, and lower change in ADHD symptoms was associated with higher medication use in adults (P=0.001).

ConclusionWe found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant-treatment for ADHD on apparent cortical thickness development in adolescents and adults. The identified age-dependent differences in apparent cortical thickness development are consistent with existing literature on typical cortical development.

Summary statementThis prospective longitudinal study in male adolescents and adults found that stimulant medication does not modulate long-term apparent cortical thickness development.

Key resultsO_LIIn this prospective longitudinal structural MRI study of 32 male adolescents and 24 men previously diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we found no evidence for long-term effects of stimulant medication on apparent cortical thickness development.
C_LIO_LIWe identified age-dependent patterns of cortical development, with reductions in apparent cortical thickness in adolescents only (P&lt;.001 in all regions of interest).

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b.

MethodsWe examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks.

ResultsAt the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down.

ConclusionsDifferent routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.</p>
