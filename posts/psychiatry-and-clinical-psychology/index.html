METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([\u0026ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received. RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration. CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known. AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses. MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated \"motivation\" and \"depression\" dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures. ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.\nLSD increases sleep duration the night after microdosing\nAuthors: Allen, N.; Jeremiah, A.; Murphy, R.; Sumner, R.; Forsyth, A.; Hoeh, N.; Menkes, D.; Evans, W.; Muthukumaraswamy, S.; Sundram, F.; Roop, P.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291970\nMicrodosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nCo-production of a Neurodiversity-Affirmative Anxiety Intervention for Autistic Children\nAuthors: Cullingham, T.; Rennard, U.; Creswell, C.; Larkin, M.; Milton, D.; Godber, L.; Buckle, K. L.; Gordon, K.; Green, J.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.23292219\nBackground: Mental health difficulties are common for autistic people; however, few interventions have been co-produced with the autistic community. Mental health interventions constructed with a non-autistic lens likely miss key understandings from autistic experiences and priorities of the autistic community. Additionally, the style and aims of intervention may be prone to unconscious bias around the pathologisation of autism. Currently, there are limited methodological and practical examples of how to rigorously co-produce mental health interventions with autistic people. This paper details the methodology and processes of co-adapting an intervention for autistic children with anxiety problems. Providing a worked example of co-producing a neurodiversity-affirmative mental health intervention which reflects autistic, parental, academic, and clinical, experience and expertise. Methods: We co-adapted content from a brief, parent-led, CBT approach for non-autistic children with anxiety problems to meet the needs of autistic children and their parents. The adaptation for autistic children was co-constructed using processes and strategies adopted from Experience-Based Co-Design (EBCD). The research team, comprising autistic and non-autistic members, worked alongside an expert reference group (ERG). The ERG comprised parents (autistic and non-autistic) of autistic children with anxiety problems, autistic adults with experience of anxiety problems, and clinicians with experience supporting autistic children with mental health difficulties. Data were obtained from qualitative research interviews with autistic children with anxiety problems and parents. These data were considered reciprocally by the research team and the ERG. Results: The resulting intervention includes a neurodiversity-affirmative perspective that considers how anxieties for autistic children can emerge from being neurodivergent in a neurotypical world integrated with traditional CBT techniques and understandings of anxiety. Conclusion: Successful co-production can help to integrate multiple theoretical backgrounds and result in the creation of interventions that are potentially acceptable to clinicians, autistic people and their family members.\nThe structural covariance of reading-related brain regions in adults and children with typical reading skills and developmental dyslexia\nAuthors: Haugg, A.; Frei, N.; Lutz, C.; Di Pietro, S. V.; Karipidis, I. I.; Brem, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292169\nStructural covariance (SC) is a promising approach for investigating brain organization within the domain of literacy and developmental disorders as it thought to reflect both functional and structural information. This study presents a first-of-its-kind exploration of SC in reading-related brain regions across different ages and reading abilities. Whole-brain SC analyses were conducted for six key regions of the reading network, including an anterior and posterior subdivision of the visual word form area (VWFA). We compared SC matrices of typically reading adults (N=134) and children (N=110), and between typically reading children and children with dyslexia (N=68). Our results showed significant associations between reading-related brain regions in typically reading adults. We observed significant SC between the posterior VWFA and the left occipital cortex, and between the anterior VWFA and the left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Typical-reading adults and children did not differ significantly in SC. However, typically reading children demonstrated significantly higher SC between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and other reading-related brain regions than children with dyslexia. Our findings provide support for a functional and structural division of the VWFA and underscore the crucial role of the IPL in fluent reading.\nEstimating the impact of transmitted and non-transmitted psychiatric and neurodevelopmental polygenic scores on youth emotional problems.\nAuthors: Shakeshaft, A.; Martin, J.; Dennison, C. A.; Riglin, L.; Lewis, C. M.; O'Donovan, M. C.; Thapar, A.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291893\nAnxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.\nTest-retest reliability of a 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visual assessment of body image disturbance in anorexia nervosa\nAuthors: Ralph-Nearman, C.; Arevian, A. C.; Karem, A.; Llano-Rios, T. F.; Sinik, M.; Moseman, S.; Feusner, J. D.; Khalsa, S. S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291397\nBody image disturbance (BID) is a diagnostic feature of anorexia nervosa (AN), with few reliable, unbiased visual markers. We examined test-retest reliability of Somatomap, a 2-dimensional(2D) and 3-dimensional(3D) digital assessment of BID. Fifty-nine AN inpatients performed test-retest by a) outlining body concern areas on a 2D avatar; and b) using sliders to sculpt 23 independent body parts on a randomized 3D avatar to reflect their current body. Corresponding body parts were measured to calculate discrepancy scores (i.e., 3D perceived minus measured values). Regional 2D BID test-retest differences were evaluated using z-scores to generate statistical body maps. Test-retest 3D assessment reliability was evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for individual and aggregated body parts. Somatomap 2D demonstrated no statistical differences between test-retest, suggesting excellent test-retest reliability. All 23 body parts on Somatomap 3D demonstrated statistically significant fair-to-excellent test-retest reliability in AN. Regions that are commonly of concern in AN, and combined measures, showed the highest reliability. Somatomap 2D and 3D may provide a reliable perceptual marker of visual BID in AN.\nChildhood maltreatment influences adult brain structure through its effects on immune, metabolic and psychosocial factors\nAuthors: Orellana, S. C.; Bethlehem, R. A. I.; Simpson-Kent, I.; van Harmelen, A.-L.; Vertes, P. E.; Bullmore, E. T.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291420\nChildhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.\nDifferential modulation of attentional ERPs in smoked and insufflated cocaine-dependent associated with neuropsychological performance\nAuthors: Aragon-Daud, A.; Oberti de Luca, S. M.; Schurmann Vignaga, S.; Prado, P.; Figueras, R.; Lizaso, L.; Gonzalez-Gadea, M. L.; Manes, F.; Cetkovich, M.; Pallavicini, C.; Torralva, T.; de la Fuente, L. A.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292384\nBackground Cocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b. Methods We examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks. Results At the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down. Conclusions Different routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials.

METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([&amp;ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received.

RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration.

CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDepression in Parkinsons disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known.

AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses.

MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated &#34;motivation&#34; and &#34;depression&#34; dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging.

ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures.

ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microdosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Mental health difficulties are common for autistic people; however, few interventions have been co-produced with the autistic community. Mental health interventions constructed with a non-autistic lens likely miss key understandings from autistic experiences and priorities of the autistic community. Additionally, the style and aims of intervention may be prone to unconscious bias around the pathologisation of autism. Currently, there are limited methodological and practical examples of how to rigorously co-produce mental health interventions with autistic people. This paper details the methodology and processes of co-adapting an intervention for autistic children with anxiety problems. Providing a worked example of co-producing a neurodiversity-affirmative mental health intervention which reflects autistic, parental, academic, and clinical, experience and expertise. Methods: We co-adapted content from a brief, parent-led, CBT approach for non-autistic children with anxiety problems to meet the needs of autistic children and their parents. The adaptation for autistic children was co-constructed using processes and strategies adopted from Experience-Based Co-Design (EBCD). The research team, comprising autistic and non-autistic members, worked alongside an expert reference group (ERG). The ERG comprised parents (autistic and non-autistic) of autistic children with anxiety problems, autistic adults with experience of anxiety problems, and clinicians with experience supporting autistic children with mental health difficulties. Data were obtained from qualitative research interviews with autistic children with anxiety problems and parents. These data were considered reciprocally by the research team and the ERG. Results: The resulting intervention includes a neurodiversity-affirmative perspective that considers how anxieties for autistic children can emerge from being neurodivergent in a neurotypical world integrated with traditional CBT techniques and understandings of anxiety. Conclusion: Successful co-production can help to integrate multiple theoretical backgrounds and result in the creation of interventions that are potentially acceptable to clinicians, autistic people and their family members.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural covariance (SC) is a promising approach for investigating brain organization within the domain of literacy and developmental disorders as it thought to reflect both functional and structural information. This study presents a first-of-its-kind exploration of SC in reading-related brain regions across different ages and reading abilities.

Whole-brain SC analyses were conducted for six key regions of the reading network, including an anterior and posterior subdivision of the visual word form area (VWFA). We compared SC matrices of typically reading adults (N=134) and children (N=110), and between typically reading children and children with dyslexia (N=68).

Our results showed significant associations between reading-related brain regions in typically reading adults. We observed significant SC between the posterior VWFA and the left occipital cortex, and between the anterior VWFA and the left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Typical-reading adults and children did not differ significantly in SC. However, typically reading children demonstrated significantly higher SC between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and other reading-related brain regions than children with dyslexia.

Our findings provide support for a functional and structural division of the VWFA and underscore the crucial role of the IPL in fluent reading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Body image disturbance (BID) is a diagnostic feature of anorexia nervosa (AN), with few reliable, unbiased visual markers. We examined test-retest reliability of Somatomap, a 2-dimensional(2D) and 3-dimensional(3D) digital assessment of BID. Fifty-nine AN inpatients performed test-retest by a) outlining body concern areas on a 2D avatar; and b) using sliders to sculpt 23 independent body parts on a randomized 3D avatar to reflect their current body. Corresponding body parts were measured to calculate discrepancy scores (i.e., 3D perceived minus measured values). Regional 2D BID test-retest differences were evaluated using z-scores to generate statistical body maps. Test-retest 3D assessment reliability was evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for individual and aggregated body parts. Somatomap 2D demonstrated no statistical differences between test-retest, suggesting excellent test-retest reliability. All 23 body parts on Somatomap 3D demonstrated statistically significant fair-to-excellent test-retest reliability in AN. Regions that are commonly of concern in AN, and combined measures, showed the highest reliability. Somatomap 2D and 3D may provide a reliable perceptual marker of visual BID in AN.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Childhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Cocaine consumption is associated with reduced attentional event-related potentials (ERPs), namely P3a and P3b, indicating bottom-up and top-down deficits respectively. At cognitive level, these impairments are larger for faster routes of administration (e.g., smoked cocaine [SC]) than slower routes (e.g., insufflated cocaine [IC]). Here we assess these ERPs considering the route of cocaine administration. We hypothesized that SC dependent (SCD) would exhibit reduced modulation of the P3a, while both SCD and IC dependent (ICD) would show reduced modulation of the P3b. Methods We examined 25 SCD, 22 ICD matched by poly-consumption profiles, and 25 controls matched by demographic variables. We combined EEG data from the Global-Local task with behavioral data from attentional cognitive tasks. Results At the behavioral level, SCD exhibited attentional deficits in both bottom-up and top-down processes, while ICD only showed a tendency for top-down deficits. Modulation of P3a and P3b was lower in consumer groups. We observed subtle route-based differences, with larger differences in the P3a for SCD and in the P3b for ICD. Neurophysiological and behavioral data converged, with the P3a associated to bottom-up performance and P3b to top-down. Conclusions Different routes of administration lead to distinct modulations of attentional neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, SCD showed greater attentional impairment, mainly at bottom-up/P3a, while ICD showed a trend of top-down/P3b deficits. These findings emphasize the crucial role of considering the route of administration in both clinical and research settings and support the use of attentional ERPs as valid measures for assessing attentional deficits in substance abuse.</p>
