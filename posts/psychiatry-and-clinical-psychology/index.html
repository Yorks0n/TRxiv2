Females are less likely to be diagnosed or prescribed ADHD medication. This study uses national healthcare records, to investigate sex differences in diagnosis and clinical care in young people with ADHD, particularly regarding recognition and treatment of other mental health conditions. Method: The cohort included individuals diagnosed with ADHD, born between 1989 and 2013 and living in Wales between 2000 and 2019. Routine primary and secondary healthcare record data were used to derive diagnoses of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions, as well as ADHD and antidepressant medications. Demographic variables included ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and contact with social services. Results: There were 16,458 individuals diagnosed with ADHD (20.3% females, ages 3-30 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1. Higher ratios (4.8:1) were seen in individuals diagnosed younger (\u003c12 years), with the lowest ratio (1.9:1) in those diagnosed as adults (\u003e18). Males were younger at first recorded ADHD diagnosis (mean=10.9 vs 12.6 years), more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, and younger at diagnosis of co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions. In contrast, females were more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition and to be prescribed antidepressant medications, prior to ADHD diagnosis. These sex differences were largely stable across demographic groups. Conclusion: This study adds to the evidence base that females with ADHD are experiencing later recognition and treatment of ADHD. The results indicate that this may be partly because of diagnostic over-shadowing from other mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, or initial misdiagnosis. Further research and dissemination of findings to the public are needed to improve awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in females.\nCovid-19 Related Generalized Anxiety Disorder Among Health Care Workers In A Hospital In The Greater Accra Region\nAuthors: Ohakpougwu, C. E.; Bebobru, W. M.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297097\nBackgroundThe emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana. AimThe aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra. MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD. ResultsThe GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore, being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs. ConclusionCOVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.\nPhysical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services: a scoping review\nAuthors: Tew, G.; Peckham, E.; Ker, S.; Smith, J.; Hodgson, P.; Machaczek, K.; Faires, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297222\nPeople with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.\nA Pilot Study of a Ketogenic Diet in Bipolar Disorder: Clinical, Metabolomic and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Outcomes\nAuthors: Campbell, I. H.; Needham, N.; Grossi, H.; Kamenska, I.; Luz, S.; Sheehan, S.; Thompson, G.; Thrippleton, M. J.; Gibbs, M. C.; Leitao, J.; Moses, T.; Burgess, K.; Meadowcroft, B.; Rigby, B.; Simpson, S.; McIntosh, E.; Brown, R.; Grigorjeva, M. M.; Creasy, F.; Norrie, J.; Mclellan, A.; Fisher, C.; Campbell, H.; Smith, D.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297391\nBackground Bipolar disorder and epilepsy are treated with anti-seizure medications. Preliminary evidence indicates that a ketogenic diet (a metabolic treatment for epilepsy) may be effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Aims To explore the impact of a ketogenic diet on clinical outcomes, and metabolomic and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers. Methods Euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (N=27) were recruited to a 6-8 week single-arm trial of a modified ketogenic diet and a range of metabolic and clinical outcome measures were assessed. Results There was a positive correlation between daily ketone levels and ecological momentary assessments of mood (p \u003c 0.001) and energy (p \u003c 0.001) and an inverse correlation between ketone levels and impulsivity (p \u003c 0.001) and anxiety (p \u003c 0.001). Mean weight fell by 4.2kg (p \u003c 0.001), mean BMI fell by 5.3% (p \u003c 0.001) and mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7.4 mmHg (p \u003c 0.041). Brain Glx (a putative marker of treatment response to anti-seizure medication) decreased by 13.1% in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p \u003c 0.001) and by 9.2% in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC (p = 0.02). At the dietary cessation period, one third of participants, who reported reduced mood lability, opted to remain on a ketogenic diet. Conclusion The majority of participants had improved cardiometabolic risk parameters and approximately one third experienced improvement in psychiatric symptoms. The study findings are consistent with our a priori hypothesis of ketone bodies acting as an alternative metabolic substrate under conditions of impaired insulin signalling in a subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder.\nDistinct longitudinal brain white matter microstructure changes and associated polygenic risk of common psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Korbmacher, M.; van der Meer, D.; Beck, D.; Askeland-Gjerde, D. E.; Eikefjord, E. N.; Lundervold, A.; Andreassen, O. A.; Westlye, L. T.; Maximov, I. I.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297257\nDuring the course of adulthood and ageing, white matter (WM) structure and organisation are characterised by slow degradation processes such as demyelination and shrinkage. An acceleration of such ageing process has been linked to the development of a range of diseases. Thus, an accurate description of healthy brain maturation, in particular, in terms of WM features, provides a cornerstone in the understanding of ageing. We use longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to provide an overview of WM changes at different spatial and temporal scales in the UK Biobank (UKB) (N=2,678; agescan1=62.38{+/-}7.23 years; agescan2=64.81{+/-}7.1 years). To examine the genetic overlap between WM structure and common clinical conditions, we tested the associations between WM structure and polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimers disease, and common psychiatric disorders (uniand bipolar depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, autism, schizophrenia, attention-deficit-hyperactivity) in longitudinal (N=2,329) and crosssectional UKB validation data (N=31,056). Global and regional single and multi-compartment fractional anisotropy, intra-axonal water fraction, and kurtosis metrics decreased [Formula], whereas diffusivity metrics, and free water increased with age [Formula], with the annual rate of WM change (ARoC) accelerating at higher ages for both global [Formula] and regional WM metrics [Formula]. Voxel-level trends indicated decreasing anisotropy, and variable spatial patterns for other diffusion metrics, suggesting differential changes in frontal compared to other brain regions. Although effect sizes were small [Formula], ARoC in middle cerebral peduncle WM had the strongest association with PGRS, especially for Alzheimers: [Formula]. PGRS were more strongly related to ARoC than cross-sectional measures (dscan1=0.03, dscan2=0.03, dvalidation=0.03). Our findings indicate spatially distributed WM changes across the brain, as well as distributed associations of PGRS with WM. Importantly, brain longitudinal changes reflected the genetic risk for disorder development better than the utilised cross-sectional measures, with regional differences giving more specific insights into gene-brain change associations than global averages.\nTowards Understanding Autism Heterogeneity: Identifying Clinical Subgroups and Neuroanatomical Deviations\nAuthors: Meijer, J.; Hebling Vieira, B.; Elleaume, C.; Baranczuk-Turska, Z.; Langer, N.; Floris, D. L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.23297299\nAutism Spectrum Disorder ('autism') is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial behavioural and neuroanatomical heterogeneity. This poses significant challenges to understanding its neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective interventions. Identifying phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups and shifting the focus from average group differences to individuals is a promising approach to addressing heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to parse clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity in autism by combining clustering of clinical features with normative modeling based on neuroanatomical measures (cortical thickness [CT] and subcortical volume) within the ABIDE datasets (N autism=861, N neurotypical=886, age-range 5-64). First, model-based clustering was applied to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to identify clinical subgroups of autism. Next, we examined whether clinical subgrouping resulted in increased neurobiological homogeneity within the subgroups compared to the entire autism group by comparing their spatial overlap of neuroanatomical deviations. We further investigated whether the identified subgroups improved the accuracy of autism classification based on the neuroanatomical deviations using supervised machine learning with cross-validation. Results yielded two clinical subgroups primarily differing in restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRB). Both subgroups showed increased homogeneity in localized deviations with the high-RRB subgroup showing increased volume deviations in cerebellum and the low-RRB subgroup showing decreased CT deviations predominantly in the postcentral gyrus and fusiform cortex. Nevertheless, substantial within-group heterogeneity remained highlighted by the failure of the classifier to distinguish between the subgroups. Identifying subgroups of autism has substantial clinical implications opening the potential for more tailored behavioural interventions and improving clinical outcomes.\nThe neuronal chromatin landscape in adult schizophrenia brains is linked to early fetal development\nAuthors: Girdhar, K.; Bendl, J.; Baumgartner, A.; Therrien, K.; Venkatesh, S.; Mathur, D.; Dong, P.; Rahman, S.; Kleopoulos, S. P.; Misir, R.; Reach, S. M.; Auluck, P.; Marenco, S.; Lewis, D. A.; Haroutunian, V.; Funk, C.; Voloudakis, G.; Hoffman, G. E.; Fullard, J.; Roussos, P.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296067\nNon-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.\nBrain-targeted autoimmunity is strongly associated with Long COVID and its chronic fatigue syndrome as well as its affective symptoms.\nAuthors: Almulla, A. F.; Maes, M.; Zhou, B.; Al-Hakeim, H.; Vojdani, A.\nScore: 200.9, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296554\nBackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Population-based studies have observed sex biases in the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Females are less likely to be diagnosed or prescribed ADHD medication. This study uses national healthcare records, to investigate sex differences in diagnosis and clinical care in young people with ADHD, particularly regarding recognition and treatment of other mental health conditions. Method: The cohort included individuals diagnosed with ADHD, born between 1989 and 2013 and living in Wales between 2000 and 2019. Routine primary and secondary healthcare record data were used to derive diagnoses of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions, as well as ADHD and antidepressant medications. Demographic variables included ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and contact with social services. Results: There were 16,458 individuals diagnosed with ADHD (20.3% females, ages 3-30 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1. Higher ratios (4.8:1) were seen in individuals diagnosed younger (&lt;12 years), with the lowest ratio (1.9:1) in those diagnosed as adults (&gt;18). Males were younger at first recorded ADHD diagnosis (mean=10.9 vs 12.6 years), more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, and younger at diagnosis of co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions. In contrast, females were more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition and to be prescribed antidepressant medications, prior to ADHD diagnosis. These sex differences were largely stable across demographic groups. Conclusion: This study adds to the evidence base that females with ADHD are experiencing later recognition and treatment of ADHD. The results indicate that this may be partly because of diagnostic over-shadowing from other mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, or initial misdiagnosis. Further research and dissemination of findings to the public are needed to improve awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana.

AimThe aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD.

ResultsThe GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore, being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">People with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Bipolar disorder and epilepsy are treated with anti-seizure medications. Preliminary evidence indicates that a ketogenic diet (a metabolic treatment for epilepsy) may be effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Aims To explore the impact of a ketogenic diet on clinical outcomes, and metabolomic and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers. Methods Euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (N=27) were recruited to a 6-8 week single-arm trial of a modified ketogenic diet and a range of metabolic and clinical outcome measures were assessed. Results There was a positive correlation between daily ketone levels and ecological momentary assessments of mood (p &lt; 0.001) and energy (p &lt; 0.001) and an inverse correlation between ketone levels and impulsivity (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001). Mean weight fell by 4.2kg (p &lt; 0.001), mean BMI fell by 5.3% (p &lt; 0.001) and mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7.4 mmHg (p &lt; 0.041). Brain Glx (a putative marker of treatment response to anti-seizure medication) decreased by 13.1% in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p &lt; 0.001) and by 9.2% in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC (p = 0.02). At the dietary cessation period, one third of participants, who reported reduced mood lability, opted to remain on a ketogenic diet. Conclusion The majority of participants had improved cardiometabolic risk parameters and approximately one third experienced improvement in psychiatric symptoms. The study findings are consistent with our a priori hypothesis of ketone bodies acting as an alternative metabolic substrate under conditions of impaired insulin signalling in a subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the course of adulthood and ageing, white matter (WM) structure and organisation are characterised by slow degradation processes such as demyelination and shrinkage. An acceleration of such ageing process has been linked to the development of a range of diseases. Thus, an accurate description of healthy brain maturation, in particular, in terms of WM features, provides a cornerstone in the understanding of ageing. We use longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to provide an overview of WM changes at different spatial and temporal scales in the UK Biobank (UKB) (N=2,678; agescan1=62.38{&#43;/-}7.23 years; agescan2=64.81{&#43;/-}7.1 years). To examine the genetic overlap between WM structure and common clinical conditions, we tested the associations between WM structure and polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimers disease, and common psychiatric disorders (uniand bipolar depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, autism, schizophrenia, attention-deficit-hyperactivity) in longitudinal (N=2,329) and crosssectional UKB validation data (N=31,056). Global and regional single and multi-compartment fractional anisotropy, intra-axonal water fraction, and kurtosis metrics decreased [Formula], whereas diffusivity metrics, and free water increased with age [Formula], with the annual rate of WM change (ARoC) accelerating at higher ages for both global [Formula] and regional WM metrics [Formula]. Voxel-level trends indicated decreasing anisotropy, and variable spatial patterns for other diffusion metrics, suggesting differential changes in frontal compared to other brain regions. Although effect sizes were small [Formula], ARoC in middle cerebral peduncle WM had the strongest association with PGRS, especially for Alzheimers: [Formula]. PGRS were more strongly related to ARoC than cross-sectional measures (dscan1=0.03, dscan2=0.03, dvalidation=0.03). Our findings indicate spatially distributed WM changes across the brain, as well as distributed associations of PGRS with WM. Importantly, brain longitudinal changes reflected the genetic risk for disorder development better than the utilised cross-sectional measures, with regional differences giving more specific insights into gene-brain change associations than global averages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism Spectrum Disorder (&#39;autism&#39;) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial behavioural and neuroanatomical heterogeneity. This poses significant challenges to understanding its neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective interventions. Identifying phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups and shifting the focus from average group differences to individuals is a promising approach to addressing heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to parse clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity in autism by combining clustering of clinical features with normative modeling based on neuroanatomical measures (cortical thickness [CT] and subcortical volume) within the ABIDE datasets (N autism=861, N neurotypical=886, age-range 5-64). First, model-based clustering was applied to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to identify clinical subgroups of autism. Next, we examined whether clinical subgrouping resulted in increased neurobiological homogeneity within the subgroups compared to the entire autism group by comparing their spatial overlap of neuroanatomical deviations. We further investigated whether the identified subgroups improved the accuracy of autism classification based on the neuroanatomical deviations using supervised machine learning with cross-validation. Results yielded two clinical subgroups primarily differing in restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRB). Both subgroups showed increased homogeneity in localized deviations with the high-RRB subgroup showing increased volume deviations in cerebellum and the low-RRB subgroup showing decreased CT deviations predominantly in the postcentral gyrus and fusiform cortex. Nevertheless, substantial within-group heterogeneity remained highlighted by the failure of the classifier to distinguish between the subgroups. Identifying subgroups of autism has substantial clinical implications opening the potential for more tailored behavioural interventions and improving clinical outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B.

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof.

ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801.

ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>
