ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\nTesting the sensitivity of diagnosis-derived patterns in functional brain networks to symptom burden in a Norwegian youth sample\nAuthors: Voldsbekk, I.; Kjelkenes, R.; Frogner, E. R.; Westlye, L. T.; Alnaes, D.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296736\nAberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established. We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria). Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms. Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.\nTransdiagnostic failure to adapt interoceptive precision estimates across affective, substance use, and eating disorders: A replication study\nAuthors: Lavalley, C. A.; Hakimi, N.; Taylor, S.; Kuplicki, R.; Forthman, K. L.; Stewart, J. L.; Paulus, M. P.; Khalsa, S. S.; Smith, R.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296870\nRecent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.\nTwo neurostructural subtypes: results of machine learning on brain images from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia\nAuthors: Jiang, Y.; Luo, C.; Wang, J.; Palaniyappan, L.; Chang, X.; Xiang, S.; Zhang, J.; Duan, M.; Huang, H.; Gaser, C.; Nemoto, K.; Miura, K.; Hashimoto, R.; Westlye, L. T.; Richard, G.; Fernandez-Cabello, S.; Parker, N.; Andreassen, O. A.; Kircher, T.; Nenadi?, I.; Stein, F.; Thomas-Odenthal, F.; Teutenberg, L.; Usemann, P.; Dannlowski, U.; Hahn, T.; Grotegerd, D.; Meinert, S.; Lencer, R.; Tang, Y.; Zhang, T.; Li, C.; Yue, W.; Zhang, Y.; Yu, X.; Zhou, E.; Lin, C.-P.; Tsai, S.-J.; Rodrigue, A. L.; Glahn, D.; Pearlson, G.; Blangero, J.; Karuk, A.; pomarol-Clotet, E.; Salvador, R.; Fuentes-Claramonte, Score: 7.5, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296862\nMachine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{+/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{+/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Broca's area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.\nCognitive Processing Speed and Loneliness in Stroke Survivors: Insights from a Large- Scale Cohort Study\nAuthors: Byrne, C.; Coetzer, R.; Ramsey, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296730\nObjectiveLoneliness, when prolonged, is associated with many deleterious effects and has been shown to be highly prevalent in those with a history of stroke, yet the cognitive mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which cognitive factors, with specific focus on processing speed, are associated with loneliness in those with a history of stroke. MethodUtilizing data from the British Cohort Study (BCS), a nationally representative dataset, we conducted secondary data analysis. A total of 7,752 participants completed relevant questions related to health, social interactions, demographics, loneliness, and cognitive assessments. Among them, 47 had experienced a stroke (\"stroke,\" n = 47), 5,545 reported other health conditions (\"ill,\" n = 5,545), and 2,857 were deemed healthy (\"healthy,\" n = 2,857) ResultsConsistent with previous research, our findings confirmed a positive correlation between stroke history and heightened loneliness. However, inferential analysis revealed that processing speed, alongside other cognitive factors, had a minimal impact on loneliness, with correlations too small to draw definitive conclusions. ConclusionThis study suggests that cognitive processing speed alone is not a robust predictor of loneliness in stroke survivors. Consequently, when developing interventions to combat loneliness in this population, it is crucial to consider a broader spectrum of factors, such as social engagement, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships. This underscores the imperative need for comprehensive assessments to better comprehend the multifaceted nature of loneliness and inform more effective intervention strategies.\nRethinking conceptualizations of adult ADHD and how care is provided: a qualitative study\nAuthors: Ginapp, C. M.; Greenberg, N. R.; Macdonald-Gagnon, G.; Angarita, G. A.; Bold, K. W.; Potenza, M. N.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296967\nBackground: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that frequently persists into adulthood. Adults with ADHD often have unmet needs including experiencing high rates of substance use disorders, incarceration, and unemployment. Despite having unmet needs, there is little research on how adults with ADHD conceptualize their condition and how they believe the care they receive could be improved. We aimed to better understand what adults with ADHD would like the medical community to know about what it is like to live with ADHD and to characterize possible misconceptions of ADHD they would like to see addressed. Method: Nine online focus groups involving young adults (aged 18-35 years, N = 43) recruited from online communities for people with ADHD were conducted. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework. Results: Individually, participants reported wanting increased support, education, and rejection of stigma. Structurally, participants reported desiring ADHD to be reframed as a difference as opposed to a disorder, viewing of ADHD as a mismatch with their environments, and wanting the condition to be viewed through the lens of what it is like to embody the condition. Conclusions: Incorporating patient-lived experiences into psychiatric diagnoses may increase diagnostic patient-centeredness and help healthcare providers better meet patient needs.\nSubtyping Schizophrenia Using Psychiatric Polygenic Scores\nAuthors: Lu, Y.; Kowalec, K.; Song, J.; Karlsson, R.; Harder, A.; Giusti-Rodriguez, P.; Sullivan, P. F.; Yao, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296915\nBackground. Subtyping schizophrenia can disentangle heterogeneity and help with treatment decision-making. However, current schizophrenia subtypes have not demonstrated adequate clinical utility, limited by sample size, suboptimal clustering methods, and choice of clustering input. Polygenic scores (PGS) reflect the genetic risk of phenotypes including comorbidities and are available before treatment, making them candidate clustering input. Methods. We derived PGS for schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder type-1, depression, and intelligence in 4,915 schizophrenia cases with register linkage. We randomly divided the sample into discovery and replication partitions and applied a novel clustering workflow on both: preprocessing PGS, feature extraction with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and clustering with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). After replication, we re-performed clustering on the entire sample and evaluated treatment-relevant variables of medication and hospitalization (extracted from registers) across clusters. Outcomes. We identified five well-replicated PGS clusters. Cluster 1 (26% of entire sample) with generally lower PGS, had the least use of antipsychotics (including clozapine), and fewer outpatient visits. Cluster 2 (48%) with generally higher PGS, especially schizophrenia PGS, had more prescriptions of antipsychotics including clozapine and longer treatment with clozapine. Each featured by specific PGS, clusters 3 (high IQ-PGS, 11%), 4 (high ASD-PGS, 8%), 5 (high BIP-PGS, 7%) showed sub-threshold level significance in the corresponding phenotypic measures but did not differ significantly in the treatment-relevant variables. Solely categorizing the patients with SCZ-PGS did not generate any significant patterns in the phenotypic and treatment-relevant variables. Interpretation. The results suggest that combinations of PGS of brain disorders and traits can provide clinically relevant clusters, offering a direction for future research on schizophrenia subtyping. Future replications in independent samples are required. The workflow can be generalized to other disorders and with mechanism-informed PGS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B.

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof.

ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801.

ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant brain network development represents a putative key aetiological component in mental disorders, which typically emerge during childhood and adolescence. Previous resting-state fMRI studies have identified brain connectivity patterns reflecting psychopathology, but the generalisability to other samples and politico-cultural contexts has not been established.

We investigated whether a previously identified cross-diagnostic case-control and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-specific pattern of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (discovery sample; children and adolescents aged 5-21 from New York City, USA; n = 1666) would replicate in a Norwegian convenience-based sample of youth (validation sample; children and adolescents aged 9-25 from Oslo, Norway; n = 531). As a test of generalisability, we investigated if these diagnosis-derived RSFC patterns were sensitive to levels of symptom burden in both samples, based on an independent measure of symptom burden (i.e., not diagnostic criteria).

Both the cross-diagnostic and ASD-specific RSFC pattern was replicated across samples. Connectivity patterns were significantly associated with thematically appropriate symptom dimensions in the discovery sample. In the validation sample, the ASD-specific RSFC pattern showed a weak, inverse relationship with symptoms of conduct problems, hyperactivity, and prosociality, while the cross-diagnostic pattern was not significantly linked to symptoms.

Diagnosis-derived connectivity patterns in a developmental clinical US sample are replicable in a convenience sample of Norwegian youth, however, they were not predictive of mental health symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{&#43;/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{&#43;/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Broca&#39;s area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveLoneliness, when prolonged, is associated with many deleterious effects and has been shown to be highly prevalent in those with a history of stroke, yet the cognitive mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which cognitive factors, with specific focus on processing speed, are associated with loneliness in those with a history of stroke.

MethodUtilizing data from the British Cohort Study (BCS), a nationally representative dataset, we conducted secondary data analysis. A total of 7,752 participants completed relevant questions related to health, social interactions, demographics, loneliness, and cognitive assessments. Among them, 47 had experienced a stroke (&#34;stroke,&#34; n = 47), 5,545 reported other health conditions (&#34;ill,&#34; n = 5,545), and 2,857 were deemed healthy (&#34;healthy,&#34; n = 2,857)

ResultsConsistent with previous research, our findings confirmed a positive correlation between stroke history and heightened loneliness. However, inferential analysis revealed that processing speed, alongside other cognitive factors, had a minimal impact on loneliness, with correlations too small to draw definitive conclusions.

ConclusionThis study suggests that cognitive processing speed alone is not a robust predictor of loneliness in stroke survivors. Consequently, when developing interventions to combat loneliness in this population, it is crucial to consider a broader spectrum of factors, such as social engagement, emotional well-being, and interpersonal relationships. This underscores the imperative need for comprehensive assessments to better comprehend the multifaceted nature of loneliness and inform more effective intervention strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition that frequently persists into adulthood. Adults with ADHD often have unmet needs including experiencing high rates of substance use disorders, incarceration, and unemployment. Despite having unmet needs, there is little research on how adults with ADHD conceptualize their condition and how they believe the care they receive could be improved. We aimed to better understand what adults with ADHD would like the medical community to know about what it is like to live with ADHD and to characterize possible misconceptions of ADHD they would like to see addressed. Method: Nine online focus groups involving young adults (aged 18-35 years, N = 43) recruited from online communities for people with ADHD were conducted. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis framework. Results: Individually, participants reported wanting increased support, education, and rejection of stigma. Structurally, participants reported desiring ADHD to be reframed as a difference as opposed to a disorder, viewing of ADHD as a mismatch with their environments, and wanting the condition to be viewed through the lens of what it is like to embody the condition. Conclusions: Incorporating patient-lived experiences into psychiatric diagnoses may increase diagnostic patient-centeredness and help healthcare providers better meet patient needs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background. Subtyping schizophrenia can disentangle heterogeneity and help with treatment decision-making. However, current schizophrenia subtypes have not demonstrated adequate clinical utility, limited by sample size, suboptimal clustering methods, and choice of clustering input. Polygenic scores (PGS) reflect the genetic risk of phenotypes including comorbidities and are available before treatment, making them candidate clustering input. Methods. We derived PGS for schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder type-1, depression, and intelligence in 4,915 schizophrenia cases with register linkage. We randomly divided the sample into discovery and replication partitions and applied a novel clustering workflow on both: preprocessing PGS, feature extraction with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and clustering with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). After replication, we re-performed clustering on the entire sample and evaluated treatment-relevant variables of medication and hospitalization (extracted from registers) across clusters. Outcomes. We identified five well-replicated PGS clusters. Cluster 1 (26% of entire sample) with generally lower PGS, had the least use of antipsychotics (including clozapine), and fewer outpatient visits. Cluster 2 (48%) with generally higher PGS, especially schizophrenia PGS, had more prescriptions of antipsychotics including clozapine and longer treatment with clozapine. Each featured by specific PGS, clusters 3 (high IQ-PGS, 11%), 4 (high ASD-PGS, 8%), 5 (high BIP-PGS, 7%) showed sub-threshold level significance in the corresponding phenotypic measures but did not differ significantly in the treatment-relevant variables. Solely categorizing the patients with SCZ-PGS did not generate any significant patterns in the phenotypic and treatment-relevant variables. Interpretation. The results suggest that combinations of PGS of brain disorders and traits can provide clinically relevant clusters, offering a direction for future research on schizophrenia subtyping. Future replications in independent samples are required. The workflow can be generalized to other disorders and with mechanism-informed PGS.</p>
