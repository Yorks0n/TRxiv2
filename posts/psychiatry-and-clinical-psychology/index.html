However, most research has studied adolescents from the general population, overlooking clinical groups. To address this gap, we synthesize, quantify and compare evidence on the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms in adolescent clinical and community samples. Data SourcesWe searched five electronic databases for peer-reviewed publications (MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus) and preprints (Europe PMC) published in English between 2007 and 2022. Study SelectionWe included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies quantifying the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms, excluding experimental studies and randomised controlled trials. Two blinded reviewers initially identified 7389 studies. Data Extraction and SynthesisWe adhered to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for selection and reporting. The data was pooled using a random-effect model and robust variance estimation. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of evidence with the Quality of Survey Studies in Psychology Checklist. Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe preregistered our hypotheses and primary study outcomes on PROSPERO (CRD42022321473). Articles were included if they reported at least one quantitative measure of a) social media use: time spent, active vs. passive use, activity, content, user perception, and other; and b) internalising symptoms: anxiety, depression or both. ResultsWe reviewed 127 studies including 1,061,293 adolescents and 775 effect sizes, of which only 8% examined clinical samples. In these samples, we found a positive, significant yet small meta-correlation between social media use and internalising symptoms, both for time spent (N = 2893, r = .08, 95% CI = [.01, .15], p = .033, I2 = 57.83) and user engagement (N = 859; r = .12, 95% CI = [.09, .15], p = .002, I2 = 82.67). These associations mirrored those in community samples. Conclusions and RelevanceWe highlight a lack of research on clinical populations, a critical gap considering that public concerns centre on the increase in youth mental health symptoms at clinical levels. This paucity of evidence not only restricts the generalizability of existing research but also hinders our ability to effectively evaluate and compare the link between social media use and youth mental health.\nBrain-Wide Mendelian Randomization Study of Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms\nAuthors: Zanoaga, M.-D.; Friligkou, E.; He, J.; Pathak, G. A.; Koller, D.; Cabrera Mendoza, B.; Stein, M.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295448\nBackgroundTo gain insights into the role of brain structure and function on anxiety (ANX), we conducted a genetically informed investigation leveraging information from ANX genome-wide association studies available from UK Biobank (UKB; N=380,379), FinnGen Program (N=290,361), and Million Veteran Program (MVP; N=199,611) together with UKB genome-wide data (N=33,224) related to 3,935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDP). MethodsA genetic correlation analysis between ANX and brain IDPs was performed using linkage disequilibrium score regression. To investigate ANX-brain associations, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed considering multiple methods and sensitivity analyses. A subsequent multivariable MR (MVMR) was executed to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Finally, a generalized linear model was used to explore the associations of brain IDPs with ANX symptoms. ResultsAfter false discovery rate correction (FDR q\u003c0.05), we identified 41 brain IDPs genetically correlated with ANX without heterogeneity among the datasets investigated (i.e., UKB, FinnGen, and MVP). Six of these IDPs showed genetically inferred causal effects on ANX. In the subsequent MVMR analysis, reduced area of the right posterior middle-cingulate gyrus (rpMCG; beta=-0.09, P= 8.01x10-4) and reduced gray-matter volume of the right anterior superior temporal gyrus (raSTG; beta=-0.09, P=1.55x10-3) had direct effects on ANX. In the ANX symptom-level analysis, rpMCG was negatively associated with \"tense sore oraching muscles during the worst period of anxiety\" (beta=-0.13, P=8.26x10-6). ConclusionsThis study identified genetically inferred effects generalizable across large cohorts, contributing to understand how changes in brain structure and function can lead to ANX.\nRecapturing the Initial Clinical Benefit of TMS in a Major Depressive Episode: a Retrospective Analysis in a Veteran Cohort\nAuthors: Laufer, J.; Olmsted, A.; Sampair, I.; Madore, M.; Yoon, J.; Hack, L. M.; Keller, C. J.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295376\nBackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now widely accepted as an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated acute TMS courses can recapture the antidepressant effects of the initial acute course is still an open question, especially in the Veteran population. We present here a retrospective analysis of a specialty clinic within the Veteran Affairs Hospital System to help address this question. AimsFollowing an acute treatment course of TMS, we sought to determine the treatment response of a subsequent TMS course. We hypothesized that those who responded to an initial acute TMS course would respond in a similar manner to a subsequent treatment course. Methods116 cases referred for evaluation for TMS between September 2017 to April 2021 were reviewed. 63 Veterans completed at least one acute course of TMS and 12 completed at least two courses and met inclusion criteria for this review. Symptoms were evaluated via self-reported scales at baseline and weekly throughout treatment. Clinical response to subsequent treatment (\u003e50% symptom reduction as measured by the PHQ-9) was compared to initial treatment response. ResultsOf the initial treatment responders (n = 6), all six responded to a second acute course, with an 85.3% symptom reduction. Of the initial treatment nonresponders (n = 6), three responded to a second acute course. Exploratory regression analysis predicted change in depression symptoms (PHQ-9) during a second TMS course using initial treatment response, time into treatment, and baseline symptom severity. Together, these factors explained 72% of the variance. No adverse events were reported in those who completed a second course, and the Veterans tolerated the treatment well. ConclusionsOur findings support the growing understanding that a second acute TMS treatment course for treatment-resistant depression is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in initial responders and some non-responders. Despite multiple confounders in a naturalistic setting, robust initial treatment response was sustained in a second acute course. Low power limits generalizability, and larger powered, prospective studies are needed.\nCo-existence of negative and positive associations between cognition and intergenerational psychiatric symptoms reveal necessity of socioeconomic and clinical enrichment\nAuthors: Pines, A.; Tozzi, L.; Bertrand, C.; Keller, A. S.; Zhang, X.; Whitfield-Gabrieli, S.; Hastie, T.; Larsen, B.; Leikauf, J.; Williams, L. M.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294743\nBackgroundMental illnesses are a leading cause of disability globally. Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children. MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level. ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children. DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.\nDiscovery of 95 PTSD loci provides insight into genetic architecture and neurobiology of trauma and stress-related disorders\nAuthors: Nievergelt, C. M.; Maihofer, A. X.; The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for PTSD, ; Stein, M. B.; Ressler, K. J.; Koenen, K. C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294915\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 novel). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (e.g., GRIA1, GRM8, CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance, and transcription factors (e.g., FOXP2, EFNA5, DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (e.g., PCLO, NCAM1, PDE4B), and endocrine or immune regulators (e.g., ESR1, TRAF3, TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear, and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.\nThe relationship between screen-based behaviors and adolescent mental health: a phenotypic and genetic analysis\nAuthors: Frei, E.; Jaholkowski, P. P.; Parekh, P.; Frei, O.; Shadrin, A. A.; Refsum Bakken, N.; Birkenaes, V.; Ask, H.; Andreassen, O. A.; Smeland, O. B.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295537\nObjective: Technological advances made screen devices readily available, with adolescents spending an increasing amount of time on screens. Despite rising concerns, evidence on the relationship between screen-based activities and adolescent mental health remains inconsistent. Method: Using self-reports from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study and ICD-10 codes for mental illness from health registries, we estimated the odds of psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents across different levels of screen usage (n = 22,096). Additionally, we computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), major depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) for adolescents without a history of mental illness and evaluated their association with time spent on screen-based activities. Results: We observed higher odds of psychiatric diagnoses among individuals with most time spent across all screen-based behaviors. However, the lowest social media usage was also associated with mental illness (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.80, 2.65), particularly with increased ASD occurrence. Minimum time spent on gaming was associated with lower odds of psychiatric diagnoses (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.84). PRSADHD was positively associated with time spent on social media and gaming, while PRSASD was positively associated with gaming, but negatively - with social media usage. Additionally, social media usage was significantly associated with lower PRSSCZ and PRSBP, but higher PRSAUD. Conclusion: We show that screen time behaviors are associated with mental illness among adolescents, which may partly reflect a shared genetic basis.\nChildhood maltreatment and subsequent risk of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19: a cohort study in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Ge, F.; Aspelund, T.; Ask, H.; Hauksdottir, A.; Hu, K.; Jakobsdottir, J.; Zoega, H.; Shen, Q.; Whalley, H. C.; Pedersen, O. B. V.; Lehto, K.; Andreassen, O. A.; Fang, F.; Song, H.; Valdimarsdottir, U. A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295354\nChildhood maltreatment has been associated with some infection-related outcomes, yet its potential role in severe COVID-19 outcomes has not been addressed. Therefore, leveraging longitudinal data from the population-based UK Biobank (N=151,427), our study aimed to explore the association between childhood maltreatment and severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization or death due to COVID-19) and its underlying mechanisms. Our results suggest that childhood maltreatment, particularly physical neglect, is associated with a 54.0% increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization or death due to COVID-19), which was not modified by genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19 outcomes. We found that 50.9% of this association was mediated by suboptimal socioeconomic status, lifestyle and prepandemic somatic diseases or psychiatric disorders. These findings highlight the role of early life adversities in severe health consequences across the lifespan and call for increased clinical surveillance of people exposed to childhood maltreatment in COVID-19 outbreaks and future pandemics.\nComorbidity Profiles of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Across the Medical Phenome\nAuthors: Hicks, E. M.; Niarchou, M.; Goleva, S.; Kabir, D.; Ciarcia, J.; PTSD \u0026 Trauma EHR Working Group, ; Smoller, J.; Davis, L.; Nievergelt, C.; Koenen, K.; Huckins, L. M.; Choi, K. W.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294572\nBackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex. MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1+ PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2+ PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression. ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients. ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceThere are many concerns about the link between social media use and adolescent mental health. However, most research has studied adolescents from the general population, overlooking clinical groups. To address this gap, we synthesize, quantify and compare evidence on the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms in adolescent clinical and community samples.

Data SourcesWe searched five electronic databases for peer-reviewed publications (MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychInfo, Scopus) and preprints (Europe PMC) published in English between 2007 and 2022.

Study SelectionWe included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies quantifying the relationship between social media use and internalising symptoms, excluding experimental studies and randomised controlled trials. Two blinded reviewers initially identified 7389 studies.

Data Extraction and SynthesisWe adhered to the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for selection and reporting. The data was pooled using a random-effect model and robust variance estimation. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of evidence with the Quality of Survey Studies in Psychology Checklist.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresWe preregistered our hypotheses and primary study outcomes on PROSPERO (CRD42022321473). Articles were included if they reported at least one quantitative measure of a) social media use: time spent, active vs. passive use, activity, content, user perception, and other; and b) internalising symptoms: anxiety, depression or both.

ResultsWe reviewed 127 studies including 1,061,293 adolescents and 775 effect sizes, of which only 8% examined clinical samples. In these samples, we found a positive, significant yet small meta-correlation between social media use and internalising symptoms, both for time spent (N = 2893, r = .08, 95% CI = [.01, .15], p = .033, I2 = 57.83) and user engagement (N = 859; r = .12, 95% CI = [.09, .15], p = .002, I2 = 82.67). These associations mirrored those in community samples.

Conclusions and RelevanceWe highlight a lack of research on clinical populations, a critical gap considering that public concerns centre on the increase in youth mental health symptoms at clinical levels. This paucity of evidence not only restricts the generalizability of existing research but also hinders our ability to effectively evaluate and compare the link between social media use and youth mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTo gain insights into the role of brain structure and function on anxiety (ANX), we conducted a genetically informed investigation leveraging information from ANX genome-wide association studies available from UK Biobank (UKB; N=380,379), FinnGen Program (N=290,361), and Million Veteran Program (MVP; N=199,611) together with UKB genome-wide data (N=33,224) related to 3,935 brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDP).

MethodsA genetic correlation analysis between ANX and brain IDPs was performed using linkage disequilibrium score regression. To investigate ANX-brain associations, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed considering multiple methods and sensitivity analyses. A subsequent multivariable MR (MVMR) was executed to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. Finally, a generalized linear model was used to explore the associations of brain IDPs with ANX symptoms.

ResultsAfter false discovery rate correction (FDR q&lt;0.05), we identified 41 brain IDPs genetically correlated with ANX without heterogeneity among the datasets investigated (i.e., UKB, FinnGen, and MVP). Six of these IDPs showed genetically inferred causal effects on ANX. In the subsequent MVMR analysis, reduced area of the right posterior middle-cingulate gyrus (rpMCG; beta=-0.09, P= 8.01x10-4) and reduced gray-matter volume of the right anterior superior temporal gyrus (raSTG; beta=-0.09, P=1.55x10-3) had direct effects on ANX. In the ANX symptom-level analysis, rpMCG was negatively associated with &#34;tense sore oraching muscles during the worst period of anxiety&#34; (beta=-0.13, P=8.26x10-6).

ConclusionsThis study identified genetically inferred effects generalizable across large cohorts, contributing to understand how changes in brain structure and function can lead to ANX.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now widely accepted as an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated acute TMS courses can recapture the antidepressant effects of the initial acute course is still an open question, especially in the Veteran population. We present here a retrospective analysis of a specialty clinic within the Veteran Affairs Hospital System to help address this question.

AimsFollowing an acute treatment course of TMS, we sought to determine the treatment response of a subsequent TMS course. We hypothesized that those who responded to an initial acute TMS course would respond in a similar manner to a subsequent treatment course.

Methods116 cases referred for evaluation for TMS between September 2017 to April 2021 were reviewed. 63 Veterans completed at least one acute course of TMS and 12 completed at least two courses and met inclusion criteria for this review. Symptoms were evaluated via self-reported scales at baseline and weekly throughout treatment. Clinical response to subsequent treatment (&gt;50% symptom reduction as measured by the PHQ-9) was compared to initial treatment response.

ResultsOf the initial treatment responders (n = 6), all six responded to a second acute course, with an 85.3% symptom reduction. Of the initial treatment nonresponders (n = 6), three responded to a second acute course. Exploratory regression analysis predicted change in depression symptoms (PHQ-9) during a second TMS course using initial treatment response, time into treatment, and baseline symptom severity. Together, these factors explained 72% of the variance. No adverse events were reported in those who completed a second course, and the Veterans tolerated the treatment well.

ConclusionsOur findings support the growing understanding that a second acute TMS treatment course for treatment-resistant depression is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in initial responders and some non-responders. Despite multiple confounders in a naturalistic setting, robust initial treatment response was sustained in a second acute course. Low power limits generalizability, and larger powered, prospective studies are needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMental illnesses are a leading cause of disability globally. Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children.

MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level.

ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children.

DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 novel). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (e.g., GRIA1, GRM8, CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance, and transcription factors (e.g., FOXP2, EFNA5, DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (e.g., PCLO, NCAM1, PDE4B), and endocrine or immune regulators (e.g., ESR1, TRAF3, TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear, and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: Technological advances made screen devices readily available, with adolescents spending an increasing amount of time on screens. Despite rising concerns, evidence on the relationship between screen-based activities and adolescent mental health remains inconsistent. Method: Using self-reports from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study and ICD-10 codes for mental illness from health registries, we estimated the odds of psychiatric diagnoses among adolescents across different levels of screen usage (n = 22,096). Additionally, we computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), major depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) for adolescents without a history of mental illness and evaluated their association with time spent on screen-based activities. Results: We observed higher odds of psychiatric diagnoses among individuals with most time spent across all screen-based behaviors. However, the lowest social media usage was also associated with mental illness (OR 2.18, 95% CI: 1.80, 2.65), particularly with increased ASD occurrence. Minimum time spent on gaming was associated with lower odds of psychiatric diagnoses (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.84). PRSADHD was positively associated with time spent on social media and gaming, while PRSASD was positively associated with gaming, but negatively - with social media usage. Additionally, social media usage was significantly associated with lower PRSSCZ and PRSBP, but higher PRSAUD. Conclusion: We show that screen time behaviors are associated with mental illness among adolescents, which may partly reflect a shared genetic basis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Childhood maltreatment has been associated with some infection-related outcomes, yet its potential role in severe COVID-19 outcomes has not been addressed. Therefore, leveraging longitudinal data from the population-based UK Biobank (N=151,427), our study aimed to explore the association between childhood maltreatment and severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization or death due to COVID-19) and its underlying mechanisms. Our results suggest that childhood maltreatment, particularly physical neglect, is associated with a 54.0% increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization or death due to COVID-19), which was not modified by genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19 outcomes. We found that 50.9% of this association was mediated by suboptimal socioeconomic status, lifestyle and prepandemic somatic diseases or psychiatric disorders. These findings highlight the role of early life adversities in severe health consequences across the lifespan and call for increased clinical surveillance of people exposed to childhood maltreatment in COVID-19 outbreaks and future pandemics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex.

MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1&#43; PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2&#43; PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression.

ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients.

ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.</p>
