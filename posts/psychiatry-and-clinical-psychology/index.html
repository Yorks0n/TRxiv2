  "articleBody": " A participatory action research study to explore adolescents experiences of adverse childhood experiences through creative workshops: a protocol\nAuthors: Butcher, I.; Mankee Williams, A.; Hugh-Jones, S.; Cooke, P.; Teasdale, B.; Shaughnessy, N.; Pavarini, G.; Smith, L.; Bhui, K.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300349\nIntroductionAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health in adolescence. There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health. Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing. Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally. Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). - This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban. - There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model. - This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research. - This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.\nLong COVID is associated with severe cognitive slowing\nAuthors: Zhao, S.; Martin, E. M.; Reuken, P. A.; Scholcz, A.; Ganse-Dumrath, A.; Srowig, A.; Utech, I.; Kozik, V.; Radscheidt, M.; Brodoehl, S.; Stallmach, A.; Schwab, M.; Fraser, E.; Finke, K.; Husain, M.\nScore: 553.8, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299331\nBackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\nCo-design and evaluation of a youth-informed organisational tool to enhance trauma-informed practices in the UK public sector: a study protocol\nAuthors: Hugh-Jones, S.; Butcher, I.; Bhui, K.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299620\nIntroductionA trauma-informed approach (TIA) means working with awareness that peoples histories of trauma may shape the way the engage with a services, organisations or institutions. Young people with childhood adversities may be at risk of re-traumatisation by organisational practices in schools, universities, and by employers and health agencies when they seek support. There are limited evidence-based resources to help people working in diverse public sector to work with adolescents in trauma-informed ways and the needs of adolescents have not been central in their development. This study contributes to public sector capacity to work in trauma-informed ways with adolescents by co-designing and evaluating the implementation of a youth-informed organisational resource. Methods and analysisThis is an Accelerated Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) study followed by a pre-post evaluation. Public sector organisations or services, and adolescents connected with them, will collaboratively reflect on lived experience data assembled through creative arts practice, alongside data from epidemiological national datasets. These will present knowledge about the impact of adverse childhood experiences on adolescents mental health (Stage 1). Collaboratively, priorities (touch points) for organisational responses will be identified (stage 2), and a low-burden resource will be co-designed (stage 3), and offered for implementation in diverse settings (stage 4) and evaluated (stage 5). This will provide insights into what adolescents and public sector organisations in the UK want from a TIA resource, the experience of organisations in implementing this and recommendations for resource development and implementation. EthicsThe UK National Health Service Health Research Authority approved this study (23/WM/0105). Knowledge products will include website detailing the created resource and a youth-created film documenting the study process, the elements of the co-designed resource, and experiences of implementation. Dissemination will target academic, healthcare, education, social care, third-sector, local government settings via knowledge exchange events, accessible briefings and publication. Strengths and Limitations (five)O_LIThis multi-site study nested study in a larger national study draws on youth lived experience and survey data to inform the co-design of a resource to support diverse public sector settings to work in trauma-informed ways. C_LIO_LIWe plan to recruit diverse young people to work in partnership with the organisations through which they are recruited, so that youth voice informs the co-design process in all its aspects. Our study also aims to understand how to deliver co-production studies with young people in ways that are trauma-informed. C_LIO_LIUse of frameworks for experience-based co-design and implementation theory is a strength. C_LIO_LIImplementation plans and evaluation protocols will be co-designed with settings, improving the chances of acceptable and meaningful resource use and evaluation. C_LIO_LIA limitation is that the time for implementation is relatively short, and not formalised, relying on participants adopting the interventions in their work places; and evaluation stage is a simple real world pre-post assessment, not a trial. C_LI\nCo designing a novel game for young people who have experienced adverse childhood experiences: Protocol\nAuthors: Butcher, I.; Fazel, M.; McCrone, P.; Krzywinska, T.; Belinskiy, A.; Smith, L.; Ma, M.; Pavarini, G.; Sansoy, H.; Mankee Williams, A.; Teasdale, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300570\nBackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has focused on utilising qualitative and quantitative measures to understand possible mechanisms, and interventions for those who may have experienced ACEs. ObjectivesThis study aims to co-design a novel digital game, in collaboration with youth and adult stakeholders, to engage 12-25-year olds in learning about the impact of ACEs and how to protect and promote mental health following ACE exposure. Additionally, this project aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention. MethodsThis study will adopt Experience Based Co- Design methods with adolescents aged between 12 and 24 living in England, and will involve adult stakeholders working in the public sector. We will then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the co-designed game on young people, and test its cost-effectiveness. ConclusionThis project will enable an insight into the processes of co-designing a youth-informed public mental health game-based intervention and feasibility and acceptability of a serious game approach for adolescents aged between 12-24 years of age who may have experienced ACEs. Strengths and limitations of this study- Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has primarily focused on quantitative and qualitative data to explore possible resources for young people. This study describes a novel digital game study for young people who may have experienced adversities. - The data on adverse childhood experiences has primarily on focused on urban and rural areas; this study seeks to recruit young people from rural, urban and coastal regions across England - This study is restricted to England, and whilst it is hoped the findings will be applicable to the U.K and more globally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of working with young people only in England - This study is one of a few studies that has sought to involve young people through the co design of a resource for young people who may have experienced adversities from initial conception of the idea to implementation of the game.\nUsing Natural Language Processing as a Scalable Mental Status Evaluation Technique\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Jagayat, J.; Kumar, A.; Shirazi, A.; Alavi, N.; Omrani, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300047\nMental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.\nOnline cognitive behavioural therapy as an initial treatment for psychological distress in patients waiting for therapy: Study protocol\nAuthors: Guiney, H.; Mahoney, A.; Morgan, A.; Elders, A.; David, C.; Howell, Z.; Codyre, D.; Rapsey, C.; Poulton, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299986\nBackgroundWait times for mental health treatment are long. This protocol describes a trial to test whether engaging in a self-directed online cognitive behavioural therapy tool (called Just a Thought) while waiting for psychological therapy is an acceptable and effective intervention for help-seeking patients. The trial will be conducted within the context of a large psychological service in Auckland, New Zealand. MethodsIn this parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, consenting patients with at least five weeks to wait for their first therapy appointment will be randomly assigned to receive Just a Thought (intervention) or waitlist-as-usual conditions plus generic wellbeing information (control) while they wait. Mental health, general health and wellbeing, and treatment satisfaction will be measured across the first ten weeks of the trial, and at 8 months. OutcomesThe primary outcomes are the acceptability and effectiveness of Just a Thought as an initial treatment. Acceptability will be assessed as participants satisfaction, and effectiveness as change in psychological distress over time (relative to control). We hypothesise that participants will be more satisfied with Just a Thought than generic wellbeing information and that those who engage in Just a Thought will show greater reductions in psychological distress than those in the waiting-as-usual group. ConclusionsOnline cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious and has the potential to provide people experiencing psychological distress with fast access to evidence-based psychological treatment. This study will provide insight into its potential as an acceptable and effective pre-treatment for people seeking psychological help.\nCopper-deficiency is associated with impairments in social behavior and oligodendrocyte development via mTOR signaling pathway\nAuthors: Usui, N.; Doi, M.; Berto, S.; Matsuoka, K.; Ishida, R.; Irie, K.; Nakama, N.; Miyauchi, H.; Fujiwara, Y.; Yamauchi, T.; Hirai, T.; Toritsuka, M.; Xie, M.-J.; Kayashima, Y.; Umeda, N.; Iwata, K.; Okumura, K.; Harada, T.; Yoshimura, T.; Katayama, T.; Tsujii, M.; Matsuzaki, H.; Makinodan, M.; Shimada, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.23300061\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, however the biological mechanisms remain unclear. Although trace elements play essential roles in the living body, it is unclear how alterations of trace elements in ASD are involved in pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the plasma metallome and identified the alterations of 11 elements in individuals with ASD. The copper decrease was negatively correlated with ASD symptom scores. A copper-deficient mouse model reflecting the condition showed ASD-like behaviors and impaired oligodendrocyte development. In copper-deficient mice, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was reduced, and its activation by agonist improved social impairment and oligodendrocyte developmental defects. Supporting these results, white matter volumes were negatively correlated with social symptoms in individuals with ASD. Our results demonstrate that copper-deficiency contributes to ASD by causing oligodendrocytes impairment via mTOR signaling. Our findings indicate that the effects of copper-deficiency and mTOR imbalance are relevant to the pathogenesis of ASD and are potential therapeutic targets.\nFirst-episode mild depression in young adults is a pre-proatherogenic condition even in the absence of subclinical metabolic syndrome: lowered lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase as a key factor\nAuthors: Maes, M.; Vasupanrajit, A.; Jirakran, K.; Zhou, B.; Tunvirachaisakul, C.; Almulla, A. F.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.24300688\nBackground: Major depression is classified into distinct subtypes: simple (SDMD) and major dysmood disorder (MDMD). MDMD patients exhibit elevated atherogenicity and decreased reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). However, comprehensive data regarding lipid metabolism is absent in first episode (FE)-SDMD. Objectives: In this case-control study, plasma lipid levels, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), free cholesterol, ApoA1, ApoB, and ApoE are compared between academic students with first episode SDMD (FE-SDMD) (n=44) or SDMD (n=64) and control students (n=44), after excluding those with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Results: LCAT is decreased, and free cholesterol and ApoE increased in subjects with SDMD and FE-SDMD as compared with controls. There were no significant alterations in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein (Apo)A1, RCT, ApoB and triglycerides in SDMD. LCAT, free cholesterol and atherogenicity indices are significantly associated with suicidal behaviors and the SDMD phenome. The effects of LCAT on those phenome features is completely mediated by free cholesterol and brooding. SDMD and FE-SDMD patients without signs of subclinical MetS show lowered LCAT and increased free cholesterol as compared with normal controls. There are significant interactions between the SDMD and FE-SDMD diagnosis and subclinical MetS, which result in decreased HDLc and RCT, and an increased ApoB/ApoA ratio. Discussion: FE-SDMD and SDMD are pre-proatherogenic states, because of decreased LCAT, and increased free cholesterol and ApoE, and their intersections with subclinical MetS. These aberrations may drive atherogenicity, and activation of peripheral and central oxidative, neuro-immune, and degenerative pathways. Individuals with FE-SDMD should be screened for increased atherogenicity risk by measuring LCAT, free cholesterol and ApoE.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health in adolescence. There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health.

Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing.

Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally.

Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
- This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban.
- There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model.
- This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research.
- This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA trauma-informed approach (TIA) means working with awareness that peoples histories of trauma may shape the way the engage with a services, organisations or institutions. Young people with childhood adversities may be at risk of re-traumatisation by organisational practices in schools, universities, and by employers and health agencies when they seek support. There are limited evidence-based resources to help people working in diverse public sector to work with adolescents in trauma-informed ways and the needs of adolescents have not been central in their development. This study contributes to public sector capacity to work in trauma-informed ways with adolescents by co-designing and evaluating the implementation of a youth-informed organisational resource.

Methods and analysisThis is an Accelerated Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) study followed by a pre-post evaluation. Public sector organisations or services, and adolescents connected with them, will collaboratively reflect on lived experience data assembled through creative arts practice, alongside data from epidemiological national datasets. These will present knowledge about the impact of adverse childhood experiences on adolescents mental health (Stage 1). Collaboratively, priorities (touch points) for organisational responses will be identified (stage 2), and a low-burden resource will be co-designed (stage 3), and offered for implementation in diverse settings (stage 4) and evaluated (stage 5). This will provide insights into what adolescents and public sector organisations in the UK want from a TIA resource, the experience of organisations in implementing this and recommendations for resource development and implementation.

EthicsThe UK National Health Service Health Research Authority approved this study (23/WM/0105). Knowledge products will include website detailing the created resource and a youth-created film documenting the study process, the elements of the co-designed resource, and experiences of implementation. Dissemination will target academic, healthcare, education, social care, third-sector, local government settings via knowledge exchange events, accessible briefings and publication.

Strengths and Limitations (five)O_LIThis multi-site study nested study in a larger national study draws on youth lived experience and survey data to inform the co-design of a resource to support diverse public sector settings to work in trauma-informed ways.
C_LIO_LIWe plan to recruit diverse young people to work in partnership with the organisations through which they are recruited, so that youth voice informs the co-design process in all its aspects. Our study also aims to understand how to deliver co-production studies with young people in ways that are trauma-informed.
C_LIO_LIUse of frameworks for experience-based co-design and implementation theory is a strength.
C_LIO_LIImplementation plans and evaluation protocols will be co-designed with settings, improving the chances of acceptable and meaningful resource use and evaluation.
C_LIO_LIA limitation is that the time for implementation is relatively short, and not formalised, relying on participants adopting the interventions in their work places; and evaluation stage is a simple real world pre-post assessment, not a trial.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has focused on utilising qualitative and quantitative measures to understand possible mechanisms, and interventions for those who may have experienced ACEs.

ObjectivesThis study aims to co-design a novel digital game, in collaboration with youth and adult stakeholders, to engage 12-25-year olds in learning about the impact of ACEs and how to protect and promote mental health following ACE exposure. Additionally, this project aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention.

MethodsThis study will adopt Experience Based Co- Design methods with adolescents aged between 12 and 24 living in England, and will involve adult stakeholders working in the public sector. We will then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the co-designed game on young people, and test its cost-effectiveness.

ConclusionThis project will enable an insight into the processes of co-designing a youth-informed public mental health game-based intervention and feasibility and acceptability of a serious game approach for adolescents aged between 12-24 years of age who may have experienced ACEs.

Strengths and limitations of this study- Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has primarily focused on quantitative and qualitative data to explore possible resources for young people. This study describes a novel digital game study for young people who may have experienced adversities.
- The data on adverse childhood experiences has primarily on focused on urban and rural areas; this study seeks to recruit young people from rural, urban and coastal regions across England
- This study is restricted to England, and whilst it is hoped the findings will be applicable to the U.K and more globally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of working with young people only in England
- This study is one of a few studies that has sought to involve young people through the co design of a resource for young people who may have experienced adversities from initial conception of the idea to implementation of the game.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundWait times for mental health treatment are long. This protocol describes a trial to test whether engaging in a self-directed online cognitive behavioural therapy tool (called  Just a Thought) while waiting for psychological therapy is an acceptable and effective intervention for help-seeking patients. The trial will be conducted within the context of a large psychological service in Auckland, New Zealand.

MethodsIn this parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, consenting patients with at least five weeks to wait for their first therapy appointment will be randomly assigned to receive Just a Thought (intervention) or waitlist-as-usual conditions plus generic wellbeing information (control) while they wait. Mental health, general health and wellbeing, and treatment satisfaction will be measured across the first ten weeks of the trial, and at 8 months.

OutcomesThe primary outcomes are the acceptability and effectiveness of Just a Thought as an initial treatment. Acceptability will be assessed as participants satisfaction, and effectiveness as change in psychological distress over time (relative to control). We hypothesise that participants will be more satisfied with Just a Thought than generic wellbeing information and that those who engage in Just a Thought will show greater reductions in psychological distress than those in the waiting-as-usual group.

ConclusionsOnline cognitive behavioural therapy is efficacious and has the potential to provide people experiencing psychological distress with fast access to evidence-based psychological treatment. This study will provide insight into its potential as an acceptable and effective pre-treatment for people seeking psychological help.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted repetitive behaviors, however the biological mechanisms remain unclear. Although trace elements play essential roles in the living body, it is unclear how alterations of trace elements in ASD are involved in pathogenesis. Here we analyzed the plasma metallome and identified the alterations of 11 elements in individuals with ASD. The copper decrease was negatively correlated with ASD symptom scores. A copper-deficient mouse model reflecting the condition showed ASD-like behaviors and impaired oligodendrocyte development. In copper-deficient mice, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was reduced, and its activation by agonist improved social impairment and oligodendrocyte developmental defects. Supporting these results, white matter volumes were negatively correlated with social symptoms in individuals with ASD. Our results demonstrate that copper-deficiency contributes to ASD by causing oligodendrocytes impairment via mTOR signaling. Our findings indicate that the effects of copper-deficiency and mTOR imbalance are relevant to the pathogenesis of ASD and are potential therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Major depression is classified into distinct subtypes: simple (SDMD) and major dysmood disorder (MDMD). MDMD patients exhibit elevated atherogenicity and decreased reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). However, comprehensive data regarding lipid metabolism is absent in first episode (FE)-SDMD. Objectives: In this case-control study, plasma lipid levels, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), free cholesterol, ApoA1, ApoB, and ApoE are compared between academic students with first episode SDMD (FE-SDMD) (n=44) or SDMD (n=64) and control students (n=44), after excluding those with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Results: LCAT is decreased, and free cholesterol and ApoE increased in subjects with SDMD and FE-SDMD as compared with controls. There were no significant alterations in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein (Apo)A1, RCT, ApoB and triglycerides in SDMD. LCAT, free cholesterol and atherogenicity indices are significantly associated with suicidal behaviors and the SDMD phenome. The effects of LCAT on those phenome features is completely mediated by free cholesterol and brooding. SDMD and FE-SDMD patients without signs of subclinical MetS show lowered LCAT and increased free cholesterol as compared with normal controls. There are significant interactions between the SDMD and FE-SDMD diagnosis and subclinical MetS, which result in decreased HDLc and RCT, and an increased ApoB/ApoA ratio. Discussion: FE-SDMD and SDMD are pre-proatherogenic states, because of decreased LCAT, and increased free cholesterol and ApoE, and their intersections with subclinical MetS. These aberrations may drive atherogenicity, and activation of peripheral and central oxidative, neuro-immune, and degenerative pathways. Individuals with FE-SDMD should be screened for increased atherogenicity risk by measuring LCAT, free cholesterol and ApoE.</p>
