Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive. MethodsWe collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T). ResultsPatients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD. LimitationsThe study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention. ConclusionsOur results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.

M.; Reuken, P. A.; Scholcz, A.; Ganse-Dumrath, A.; Srowig, A.; Utech, I.; Kozik, V.; Radscheidt, M.; Brodoehl, S.; Stallmach, A.; Schwab, M.; Fraser, E.; Finke, K.; Husain, M.\nScore: 554.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299331\nBackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients. FundingWellcome Trust (206330/Z/17/Z), NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, the Thuringer Aufbaubank (2021 FGI 0060), German Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FI 1424/2-1) and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union (ITN SmartAge, H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-859890). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\nCharacterization of parent and youth-reported eating disorder symptoms and premorbid factors in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\nAuthors: Makowski, C.; Westwater, M. L.; Rhee, K. E.; Bischoff-Grethe, A.; Wierenga, C. E.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300155\nObjectiveEating Disorders (EDs) often start in adolescence, though the prevalence, trajectory of symptom onset and predictors of illness are poorly understood, especially across sociodemographically diverse youth. Here, we leverage data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study, a large demographically representative longitudinal sample of youth in the US, to characterize the prevalence of parent- and youth-reported ED symptoms and their sociodemographic characteristics at baseline (ages 9-11) and two-years later (2-year; ages 11-14). MethodA tetrachoric factor analysis summarized clusters of ED symptoms, which were compared between parent and youth reports. Cognitive, mental and physical health variables at baseline were used to predict youth-reported symptoms at 2-year using a mixed-effects logistic regression. ResultsThree factors emerged reflecting \"weight distress\", \"weight control\", and \"bingeing\", with prevalence rates ranging from 1.5 to 7.3%. All symptoms loaded on similar factors between reporters. Rates of symptom endorsement were similar for males and females, with disproportionately higher rates across factors for youth who self-identified as sexual minority, Hispanic, Black, or Mixed race participants, and those from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, compared to the full ABCD sample. Youth and parent reports at 2-year showed [~]17% overlap. A distinct pattern of cognitive variables emerged as significant predictors of later youth-reported ED concerns, whereas mental health symptoms and traits were non-specific and associated with all ED factors. ConclusionIdentifying the landscape of ED symptoms across demographic groups, reporters and their premorbid factors in late childhood is critical to inform prevention and early intervention efforts, with particularly important implications for historically understudied racial and sexual minority groups.\nHeartbeat-evoked neural response abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorder during peripheral adrenergic stimulation\nAuthors: Verdonk, C.; Teed, A. R.; White, E. J.; Ren, X.; Stewart, J. L.; Paulus, M. P.; Khalsa, S. S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.09.23291166\nHyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, g) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 g isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n=24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the HC group (n=24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than HC during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 g isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing according to prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveEating Disorders (EDs) often start in adolescence, though the prevalence, trajectory of symptom onset and predictors of illness are poorly understood, especially across sociodemographically diverse youth. Here, we leverage data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study, a large demographically representative longitudinal sample of youth in the US, to characterize the prevalence of parent- and youth-reported ED symptoms and their sociodemographic characteristics at baseline (ages 9-11) and two-years later (2-year; ages 11-14).

MethodA tetrachoric factor analysis summarized clusters of ED symptoms, which were compared between parent and youth reports. Cognitive, mental and physical health variables at baseline were used to predict youth-reported symptoms at 2-year using a mixed-effects logistic regression.

ResultsThree factors emerged reflecting &#34;weight distress&#34;, &#34;weight control&#34;, and &#34;bingeing&#34;, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.5 to 7.3%. All symptoms loaded on similar factors between reporters. Rates of symptom endorsement were similar for males and females, with disproportionately higher rates across factors for youth who self-identified as sexual minority, Hispanic, Black, or Mixed race participants, and those from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, compared to the full ABCD sample. Youth and parent reports at 2-year showed [~]17% overlap. A distinct pattern of cognitive variables emerged as significant predictors of later youth-reported ED concerns, whereas mental health symptoms and traits were non-specific and associated with all ED factors.

ConclusionIdentifying the landscape of ED symptoms across demographic groups, reporters and their premorbid factors in late childhood is critical to inform prevention and early intervention efforts, with particularly important implications for historically understudied racial and sexual minority groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hyperarousal symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often incongruent with the observed physiological state, suggesting that abnormal processing of interoceptive signals is a characteristic feature of the disorder. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive dysfunction in GAD, we evaluated whether adrenergic modulation of cardiovascular signaling differentially affects the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP), an electrophysiological marker of cardiac interoception, during concurrent electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) scanning. Intravenous infusions of the peripheral adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.5 and 2.0 micrograms, g) were administered in a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to dynamically perturb the cardiovascular system while recording the associated EEG-fMRI responses. During the 0.5 g isoproterenol infusion, the GAD group (n=24) exhibited significantly larger changes in HEP amplitude in an opposite direction than the HC group (n=24). In addition, the GAD group showed significantly larger absolute HEP amplitudes than HC during saline infusions, when cardiovascular tone did not increase. No significant group differences in HEP amplitude were identified during the 2.0 g isoproterenol infusion. Using analyzable blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from participants with concurrent EEG-fMRI data (21 GAD and 21 HC), we found that the aforementioned HEP effects were uncorrelated with fMRI signals in the insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and somatosensory cortex, brain regions implicated in cardiac signal processing according to prior fMRI studies. These findings provide additional evidence of dysfunctional cardiac interoception in GAD and identify neural processes at the electrophysiological level that may be independent from blood oxygen level-dependent responses during peripheral adrenergic stimulation.</p>
