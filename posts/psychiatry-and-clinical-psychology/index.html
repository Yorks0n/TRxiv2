F.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301553\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is considered to be a neuroimmune disorder. However, there are no data regarding the association between comprehensive immune profiles and their interactions with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in predicting neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and severity of outpatient MDD (OMDD). MethodsWe assayed 48 serum cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors using a multiplex assay in 67 healthy controls and 66 OMDD patients. Around 50% of the OMDD and control participants had a diagnosis of MetS. ResultsTen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were upregulated in OMDD (i.e., CXCL12, TNFB, PDGF, CCL11, IL9, IL4, CCL5, CCL2, CCL4, IL1RN), indicating an immune, defense and stress response. Six DEPs were downregulated (VEGFA, IL12, CCL3, CSF1, IL1B, NGF), indicating lowered neurogenesis and regulation of neuron death. Significant interactions between OMDD and MetS caused a) substantial increases in TNF signaling, and upregulation of IL4, IL17, TNF, TNFB, CCL2, CCL5, PDGF, IL1RN; and b) downregulation of VEGFA and FGF. A large part of the variance in neuroticism (26.6%), suicidal behaviors (23.6%), and the MDD phenome (31.4%) was predicted by immunological data and interactions between MetS and CCL5, TNFB or VEGFA. DiscussionOMDD is characterized by an immunoneurotoxic profile which partly explains neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and the phenomes severity. Lowered IL-10 and increased neurotoxicity are characteristics of OMDD and other depression phenotypes, including severe first-episode inpatient MDD. The presence of MetS in OMDD considerably exacerbates immunoneurotoxicity. Consequently, immune studies in MDD should always be performed in subjects with and without MetS.\nLarge-Scale Mendelian Randomization Study Reveals Circulating Blood-based Proteomic Biomarkers for Psychopathology and Cognitive Task Performance\nAuthors: Bhattacharyya, U.; John, J.; Lam, M.; Fisher, J.; Sun, B.; Baird, D.; Chen, C.-Y.; Lencz, T.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301455\nBackgroundResearch on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance. MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes. ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance. ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.\nThe antidepressant effects of vaporized N,N-Dimethyltryptamine: a preliminary report in treatment-resistant depression\nAuthors: Falchi-Carvalho, M.; Barros, H.; Bolcont, R.; Laborde, S.; Wiessner, I.; Silva, S. R. B.; Montanini, D.; Barbosa, D.; Teixeira, E.; Florence-Vilela, R.; Almeida, R.; Macedo, R. K. A.; Arichelle, F.; J. Pantrigo, E.; Arcoverde, E.; Galvao-Coelho, N.; Araujo, D. B.; Palhano-Fontes, F.\nScore: 32.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23300610\nIntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

A discourse analytical case study\nAuthors: Hjorth, C.; mainz, J.; Thomsen, L. L. H.; Boggild, H.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301407\nIntroductionImplementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can be constrained by diverging guideline interpretations, leading to a discrepancy between the intended clinical practice and the clinical practice implemented. We examine how CPGs on lifestyle behavior for psychiatric inpatients are translated into clinical daily practice, and how this was affected by discourses surrounding the stakeholders. MethodsWe conducted a comparative case study within two psychiatric wards in Denmark, wherein a clinical practice guideline (CPG) addressing lifestyle behavior was implemented. The objective of the CPG was to strategically intervene in the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle practices among inpatients. Critical discourse analysis and a perspective of translation formed the theoretical framework. We collected empirical material at two stakeholder levels; the CPG authors and clinicians. This included documents related to the CPGs, field observations and two focus group interviews with clinicians. ResultsThe CPG were composed within a system-centered discourse where lifestyle intervention was considered relevant for all inpatients. The clinicians translated the CPGs within a person-centered discourse and a prioritization discourse, focusing on individual factors such as the patients own wishes, surplus energy, and the status of the psychiatric treatment. ConclusionThe findings show that implementation of guidelines in their original form cannot be anticipated, but will constitute translation based on social structures and their discourses. Unawareness of this phenomenon called translation may affect implementation and should be considered when CPGs are developed and launched. Future research should explore how discourses and social processes among patients influences implementation of CPGs.

C.; Sison, M.; Zhumagambetov, R.; Godoy, J. C.; Haufe, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301772\nINTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction. METHODS: A longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models' performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors. RESULTS: The highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.\nAn International, Cross-Sectional Survey of Psychiatry Researchers and Clinicians: Perceptions of Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine\nAuthors: Ng, J. Y.; Kochhar, J.; Cramer, H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301718\nBackgroundPsychiatry is a branch of medicine that focuses on mental, behavioural and emotional well-being. Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine has been an increasingly popular choice for patients with psychiatric disorders, therefore our study aimed to explore the perceptions of psychiatry researchers and clinicians on the use of CAIM. MethodsWe conducted an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey for researchers and clinicians who have published their work in psychiatry medical journals that are indexed in MEDLINE. 42,667 researchers and clinicians were sent the link to the survey after extraction of their email addresses from their respective publications. Respondents were asked numerous multiple-choice questions regarding their perceptions on various CAIM therapies, followed by an open-ended question where they could include any additional thoughts. ResultsThe survey was completed by 987 respondents, with a majority identifying as a researcher (n=447, 46.51%), or as both a researcher and a clinician (n=368, 38.29%) within the field of psychiatry. Most respondents (n=629, 78.04%) perceived mind-body therapies such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and yoga to be the most promising CAIM therapy for the prevention, treatment, and management of psychiatric diseases. Many participants said that they agree (n=285, 38.14%) that most CAIM therapies in general are safe, however, many disagree that CAIM therapies are effective (n=245, 32.93%). Respondents indicated that there is value to conducting research on CAIM therapies (n=356, 47.91%), and that there should be more funding allocated to researching these therapies (n=265, 35.71%). Respondents are also in agreement that clinicians should receive training on CAIM therapies through formal education (n=295, 39.76%) or supplementary education (n=380, 51.28%). ConclusionsThe findings from this study showed that there is great interest and potential in researching CAIM within the field of psychiatry. This information can be used as a basis for further research and to develop tailored educational resources for researchers and clinicians in psychiatry.\nPandemic-Related Post-traumatic Stress Symptomatology in COVID-19 Patients with and without Post-COVID Conditions\nAuthors: Guinee, E. P.; Raza, H.; Ballard, E.; Shaw, J. S.; Liang, C. J.; Sneller, M.; Chung, J. Y.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301574\nTrauma and stressor-related symptoms have been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies compare post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) between patients and non-infected controls. Using data from an ongoing natural history study of COVID-19, this study compared PTSS between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first year of the pandemic and controls. Within the COVID-19 patient cohort, we also compared PTSS between patients with and without post-COVID conditions, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study also examined the association of PTSS with trait resilience and prior trauma exposure. PTSS were assessed using the Impact of Event Scaled-Revised (IES-R), which has a validated probable PTSD cutoff (score [\u0026ge;]33). The results showed that patients (n=131) reported significantly higher IES-R scores than controls (n=82) and had significantly higher odds of having scores indicative of PTSD [AOR: 4.17 p: 0.029]. IES-R scores among PASC patients (n=68) were significantly elevated compared to patients without PASC (n=63) and PASC patients did not have higher odds for probable PTSD [AOR: 2.60; p: 0.14]. Trait resilience was associated with lower PTSS. These findings help characterize the mental health impact of the COVID-19 illness experience and highlight elevated PTSS in patients with persistent post-COVID conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is considered to be a neuroimmune disorder. However, there are no data regarding the association between comprehensive immune profiles and their interactions with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in predicting neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and severity of outpatient MDD (OMDD).

MethodsWe assayed 48 serum cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors using a multiplex assay in 67 healthy controls and 66 OMDD patients. Around 50% of the OMDD and control participants had a diagnosis of MetS.

ResultsTen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were upregulated in OMDD (i.e., CXCL12, TNFB, PDGF, CCL11, IL9, IL4, CCL5, CCL2, CCL4, IL1RN), indicating an immune, defense and stress response. Six DEPs were downregulated (VEGFA, IL12, CCL3, CSF1, IL1B, NGF), indicating lowered neurogenesis and regulation of neuron death. Significant interactions between OMDD and MetS caused a) substantial increases in TNF signaling, and upregulation of IL4, IL17, TNF, TNFB, CCL2, CCL5, PDGF, IL1RN; and b) downregulation of VEGFA and FGF. A large part of the variance in neuroticism (26.6%), suicidal behaviors (23.6%), and the MDD phenome (31.4%) was predicted by immunological data and interactions between MetS and CCL5, TNFB or VEGFA.

DiscussionOMDD is characterized by an immunoneurotoxic profile which partly explains neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and the phenomes severity. Lowered IL-10 and increased neurotoxicity are characteristics of OMDD and other depression phenotypes, including severe first-episode inpatient MDD. The presence of MetS in OMDD considerably exacerbates immunoneurotoxicity. Consequently, immune studies in MDD should always be performed in subjects with and without MetS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundResearch on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance.

MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes.

ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance.

ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing.

ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission.

DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionImplementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can be constrained by diverging guideline interpretations, leading to a discrepancy between the intended clinical practice and the clinical practice implemented. We examine how CPGs on lifestyle behavior for psychiatric inpatients are translated into clinical daily practice, and how this was affected by discourses surrounding the stakeholders.

MethodsWe conducted a comparative case study within two psychiatric wards in Denmark, wherein a clinical practice guideline (CPG) addressing lifestyle behavior was implemented. The objective of the CPG was to strategically intervene in the prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle practices among inpatients. Critical discourse analysis and a perspective of translation formed the theoretical framework. We collected empirical material at two stakeholder levels; the CPG authors and clinicians. This included documents related to the CPGs, field observations and two focus group interviews with clinicians.

ResultsThe CPG were composed within a system-centered discourse where lifestyle intervention was considered relevant for all inpatients. The clinicians translated the CPGs within a person-centered discourse and a prioritization discourse, focusing on individual factors such as the patients own wishes, surplus energy, and the status of the psychiatric treatment.

ConclusionThe findings show that implementation of guidelines in their original form cannot be anticipated, but will constitute translation based on social structures and their discourses. Unawareness of this phenomenon called translation may affect implementation and should be considered when CPGs are developed and launched. Future research should explore how discourses and social processes among patients influences implementation of CPGs.

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction. METHODS: A longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models&#39; performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors. RESULTS: The highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPsychiatry is a branch of medicine that focuses on mental, behavioural and emotional well-being. Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine has been an increasingly popular choice for patients with psychiatric disorders, therefore our study aimed to explore the perceptions of psychiatry researchers and clinicians on the use of CAIM.

MethodsWe conducted an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey for researchers and clinicians who have published their work in psychiatry medical journals that are indexed in MEDLINE. 42,667 researchers and clinicians were sent the link to the survey after extraction of their email addresses from their respective publications. Respondents were asked numerous multiple-choice questions regarding their perceptions on various CAIM therapies, followed by an open-ended question where they could include any additional thoughts.

ResultsThe survey was completed by 987 respondents, with a majority identifying as a researcher (n=447, 46.51%), or as both a researcher and a clinician (n=368, 38.29%) within the field of psychiatry. Most respondents (n=629, 78.04%) perceived mind-body therapies such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and yoga to be the most promising CAIM therapy for the prevention, treatment, and management of psychiatric diseases. Many participants said that they agree (n=285, 38.14%) that most CAIM therapies in general are safe, however, many disagree that CAIM therapies are effective (n=245, 32.93%). Respondents indicated that there is value to conducting research on CAIM therapies (n=356, 47.91%), and that there should be more funding allocated to researching these therapies (n=265, 35.71%). Respondents are also in agreement that clinicians should receive training on CAIM therapies through formal education (n=295, 39.76%) or supplementary education (n=380, 51.28%).

ConclusionsThe findings from this study showed that there is great interest and potential in researching CAIM within the field of psychiatry. This information can be used as a basis for further research and to develop tailored educational resources for researchers and clinicians in psychiatry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Trauma and stressor-related symptoms have been frequently reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies compare post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) between patients and non-infected controls. Using data from an ongoing natural history study of COVID-19, this study compared PTSS between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first year of the pandemic and controls. Within the COVID-19 patient cohort, we also compared PTSS between patients with and without post-COVID conditions, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study also examined the association of PTSS with trait resilience and prior trauma exposure. PTSS were assessed using the Impact of Event Scaled-Revised (IES-R), which has a validated probable PTSD cutoff (score [&amp;ge;]33). The results showed that patients (n=131) reported significantly higher IES-R scores than controls (n=82) and had significantly higher odds of having scores indicative of PTSD [AOR: 4.17 p: 0.029]. IES-R scores among PASC patients (n=68) were significantly elevated compared to patients without PASC (n=63) and PASC patients did not have higher odds for probable PTSD [AOR: 2.60; p: 0.14]. Trait resilience was associated with lower PTSS. These findings help characterize the mental health impact of the COVID-19 illness experience and highlight elevated PTSS in patients with persistent post-COVID conditions.</p>
