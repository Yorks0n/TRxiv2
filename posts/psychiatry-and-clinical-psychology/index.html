W.; Price, A. L.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302228\nDespite great progress on methods for case-control polygenic prediction (e.g. schizophrenia vs. control), there remains an unmet need for a method that genetically distinguishes clinically related disorders (e.g. schizophrenia (SCZ) vs. bipolar disorder (BIP) vs. depression (MDD) vs. control); such a method could have important clinical value, especially at disorder onset when differential diagnosis can be challenging. Here, we introduce a method, Differential Diagnosis-Polygenic Risk Score (DDx-PRS), that jointly estimates posterior probabilities of each possible diagnostic category (e.g. SCZ=50%, BIP=25%, MDD=15%, control=10%) by modeling variance/covariance structure across disorders, leveraging case-control polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each disorder (computed using existing methods) and prior clinical probabilities for each diagnostic category. DDx-PRS uses only summary-level training data and does not use tuning data, facilitating implementation in clinical settings. In simulations, DDx-PRS was well-calibrated (whereas a simpler approach that analyzes each disorder marginally was poorly calibrated), and effective in distinguishing each diagnostic category vs. the rest. We then applied DDx-PRS to Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ/BIP/MDD/control data, including summary-level training data from 3 case-control GWAS (N=41,917-173,140 cases; total N=1,048,683) and held-out test data from different cohorts with equal numbers of each diagnostic category (total N=11,460). DDx-PRS was well-calibrated and well-powered relative to these training sample sizes, attaining AUCs of 0.66 for SCZ vs. rest, 0.64 for BIP vs. rest, 0.59 for MDD vs. rest, and 0.68 for control vs. rest. DDx-PRS produced comparable results to methods that leverage tuning data, confirming that DDx-PRS is an effective method. True diagnosis probabilities in top deciles of predicted diagnosis probabilities were considerably larger than prior baseline probabilities, particularly in projections to larger training sample sizes, implying considerable potential for clinical utility under certain circumstances. In conclusion, DDx-PRS is an effective method for distinguishing clinically related disorders.\nProcess evaluation of a New psychosocial goal-setting and manualised support intervention for Independence in Dementia (NIDUS-Family)\nAuthors: Wyman, D. L.; Butler, L. T.; Morgan-Trimmer, S.; Bright, P.; Barber, J.; Budgett, J.; Walters, K.; Lang, I.; Rapaport, P.; Banks, S.; Palomo, M.; Orgeta, V.; Livingston, G.; Rockwood, K.; Lord, K.; Manthorpe, J.; Dow, B.; Hoe, J.; Cooper, C.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.24302127\nIntroductionWe report a process evaluation embedded within a UK Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), which demonstrated that New Interventions for independence in Dementia Study (NIDUS)-Family (a manualised, multimodal psychosocial intervention), was effective relative to usual care, on the primary outcome of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) over one year. We aimed to test and refine a hypothesised theory of change model delineating key causal assumptions for impact mechanisms. MethodsIn 2021-22, intervention-arm dyads completed an acceptability questionnaire developed to test causal assumptions. We interviewed dyads and their intervention facilitators, purposively selected for diverse follow-up GAS scores and sociodemographic diversity. Matching observational data were collected from intervention session recordings, using a checklist developed to test causal assumptions. We thematically analysed data, then integrated qualitative and quantitative data. Results174/204 (85.3%) dyads allocated to NIDUS-Family, fully completed the intervention, 18 partially completed it, while 12 received none. 47/192 (24.5%) of carers receiving any sessions completed the acceptability questionnaire. 27/58 (47%) dyads purposively selected, and 9/10 facilitators participated in qualitative interviews; and we observed 12 sessions. We identified four themes: A) Someone to talk to helps dyads feel supported; B) NIDUS-Family helps carers change their perspective; C) Personalisation helps people living with dementia maintain their identity; and D) Small steps help dyads move forward. ConclusionKey causal pathway mechanisms were: regular sessions with a consistent facilitator providing space to discuss priorities, supporting carers to consider new perspectives and approaches to personalising care; and planning small actionable steps towards goals. Findings will support NIDUS-Family implementation.\nStructural brain abnormalities and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia: Mega-analysis of data from 2095 patients and 2861 healthy controls via the ENIGMA consortium\nAuthors: Lamsma, J.; Raine, A.; Kia, S.

S.; Lebedeva, I\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.24302268\nBackgroundSchizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of aggressive behaviour, which may partly be explained by illness-related changes in brain structure. However, previous studies have been limited by group-level analyses, small and selective samples of inpatients and long time lags between exposure and outcome. MethodsThis cross-sectional study pooled data from 20 sites participating in the international ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. Sites acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in a total of 2095 patients with schizophrenia and 2861 healthy controls. Measures of grey matter volume and white matter microstructural integrity were extracted from the scans using harmonised protocols. For each measure, normative modelling was used to calculate how much patients deviated (in z-scores) from healthy controls at the individual level. Ordinal regression models were used to estimate the associations of these deviations with concurrent aggressive behaviour (as odds ratios [ORs] with 99% confidence intervals [CIs]). Mediation analyses were performed for positive symptoms (i.e., delusions, hallucinations and disorganised thinking), impulse control and illness insight. Aggression and potential mediators were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. ResultsAggressive behaviour was significantly associated with reductions in total cortical volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.88 [0.78, 0.98], p = .003) and global white matter integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.72 [0.59, 0.88], p = 3.50 x 10-5) and additional reductions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.85 [0.74, 0.97], p =.002), inferior parietal lobule volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.66, 0.87], p = 2.20 x 10-7) and internal capsule integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92], p = 2.90 x 10-4). Except for inferior parietal lobule volume, these associations were largely mediated by increased severity of positive symptoms and reduced impulse control. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that the co-occurrence of positive symptoms, poor impulse control and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia has a neurobiological basis, which may inform the development of therapeutic interventions.\nMachine Learning Models Predict the Emergence of Depression in Argentinean College Students during Periods of COVID-19 Quarantine\nAuthors: Lopez Steinmetz, L. C.; Sison, M.; Zhumagambetov, R.; Godoy, J. C.; Haufe, S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301772\nINTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction. METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors. RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features. DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.\nWhite Matter Microstructure Alterations and Their Link to Symptomatology in Early Psychosis and Schizophrenia\nAuthors: Pavan, T.; Aleman-Gomez, Y.; Jenni, R.; Steullet, P.; Schilliger, Z.; Dwir, D.; Cleusix, M.; Alameda, L.; Do, K. Q.; Conus, P.; Klauser, P.; Hagmann, P.; Jelescu, I.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24301979\nBackground and HypothesisStudies on schizophrenia feature diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate white matter (WM) anomalies. The heterogeneity in the possible interpretations of these metrics highlights the importance of increasing their specificity. Here, we characterize WM pathology in early psychosis (EP) and schizophrenia (SZ) with increased specificity using advanced dMRI metrics: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and White Matter Track Integrity - Watson (WMTI-W) biophysical model. This enables us to better characterize WM abnormalities and relate them to the patients symptomatology. Study DesigndMRI-derived microstructure features were extracted from all of WM and from individual tracts in 275 individuals. 93 patients with EP and 47 with SZ were compared respectively to 135 age-range matched healthy controls (HC). The relationships between the dMRI metrics in WM and various clinical scales were investigated in each patient group. Study ResultsWM diffusivities were higher, while kurtosis was lower in EP and SZ vs HC. Differences were more pronounced in EP than SZ. WMTI-W model parameters suggest alterations to the extra-axonal compartment in EP and SZ, consistent with abnormal myelin integrity and WM deterioration. Patient groups showed clustered but non-significant correlations between dMRI metrics and psychotic symptoms. Depressive dimensions were significantly associated with decreased diffusivities in WM, while manic scales correlated with increased diffusivities and reduced kurtosis. ConclusionsdMRI patterns in EP and SZ highly suggest WM deterioration in comparison to HC. DMRI changes better align with affective dimensions, while the relationship with psychotic symptoms may be confounded by competing pathological effects on the microstructure and disease heterogeneity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Despite great progress on methods for case-control polygenic prediction (e.g. schizophrenia vs. control), there remains an unmet need for a method that genetically distinguishes clinically related disorders (e.g. schizophrenia (SCZ) vs. bipolar disorder (BIP) vs. depression (MDD) vs. control); such a method could have important clinical value, especially at disorder onset when differential diagnosis can be challenging. Here, we introduce a method, Differential Diagnosis-Polygenic Risk Score (DDx-PRS), that jointly estimates posterior probabilities of each possible diagnostic category (e.g. SCZ=50%, BIP=25%, MDD=15%, control=10%) by modeling variance/covariance structure across disorders, leveraging case-control polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each disorder (computed using existing methods) and prior clinical probabilities for each diagnostic category. DDx-PRS uses only summary-level training data and does not use tuning data, facilitating implementation in clinical settings. In simulations, DDx-PRS was well-calibrated (whereas a simpler approach that analyzes each disorder marginally was poorly calibrated), and effective in distinguishing each diagnostic category vs. the rest. We then applied DDx-PRS to Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ/BIP/MDD/control data, including summary-level training data from 3 case-control GWAS (N=41,917-173,140 cases; total N=1,048,683) and held-out test data from different cohorts with equal numbers of each diagnostic category (total N=11,460). DDx-PRS was well-calibrated and well-powered relative to these training sample sizes, attaining AUCs of 0.66 for SCZ vs. rest, 0.64 for BIP vs. rest, 0.59 for MDD vs. rest, and 0.68 for control vs. rest. DDx-PRS produced comparable results to methods that leverage tuning data, confirming that DDx-PRS is an effective method. True diagnosis probabilities in top deciles of predicted diagnosis probabilities were considerably larger than prior baseline probabilities, particularly in projections to larger training sample sizes, implying considerable potential for clinical utility under certain circumstances. In conclusion, DDx-PRS is an effective method for distinguishing clinically related disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionWe report a process evaluation embedded within a UK Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), which demonstrated that New Interventions for independence in Dementia Study (NIDUS)-Family (a manualised, multimodal psychosocial intervention), was effective relative to usual care, on the primary outcome of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) over one year. We aimed to test and refine a hypothesised theory of change model delineating key causal assumptions for impact mechanisms.

MethodsIn 2021-22, intervention-arm dyads completed an acceptability questionnaire developed to test causal assumptions. We interviewed dyads and their intervention facilitators, purposively selected for diverse follow-up GAS scores and sociodemographic diversity. Matching observational data were collected from intervention session recordings, using a checklist developed to test causal assumptions. We thematically analysed data, then integrated qualitative and quantitative data.

Results174/204 (85.3%) dyads allocated to NIDUS-Family, fully completed the intervention, 18 partially completed it, while 12 received none. 47/192 (24.5%) of carers receiving any sessions completed the acceptability questionnaire. 27/58 (47%) dyads purposively selected, and 9/10 facilitators participated in qualitative interviews; and we observed 12 sessions. We identified four themes: A)  Someone to talk to helps dyads feel supported; B)  NIDUS-Family helps carers change their perspective; C)  Personalisation helps people living with dementia maintain their identity; and D)  Small steps help dyads move forward.

ConclusionKey causal pathway mechanisms were: regular sessions with a consistent facilitator providing space to discuss priorities, supporting carers to consider new perspectives and approaches to personalising care; and planning small actionable steps towards goals. Findings will support NIDUS-Family implementation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSchizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of aggressive behaviour, which may partly be explained by illness-related changes in brain structure. However, previous studies have been limited by group-level analyses, small and selective samples of inpatients and long time lags between exposure and outcome.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study pooled data from 20 sites participating in the international ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. Sites acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in a total of 2095 patients with schizophrenia and 2861 healthy controls. Measures of grey matter volume and white matter microstructural integrity were extracted from the scans using harmonised protocols. For each measure, normative modelling was used to calculate how much patients deviated (in z-scores) from healthy controls at the individual level. Ordinal regression models were used to estimate the associations of these deviations with concurrent aggressive behaviour (as odds ratios [ORs] with 99% confidence intervals [CIs]). Mediation analyses were performed for positive symptoms (i.e., delusions, hallucinations and disorganised thinking), impulse control and illness insight. Aggression and potential mediators were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.

ResultsAggressive behaviour was significantly associated with reductions in total cortical volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.88 [0.78, 0.98], p = .003) and global white matter integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.72 [0.59, 0.88], p = 3.50 x 10-5) and additional reductions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.85 [0.74, 0.97], p =.002), inferior parietal lobule volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.66, 0.87], p = 2.20 x 10-7) and internal capsule integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92], p = 2.90 x 10-4). Except for inferior parietal lobule volume, these associations were largely mediated by increased severity of positive symptoms and reduced impulse control.

ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that the co-occurrence of positive symptoms, poor impulse control and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia has a neurobiological basis, which may inform the development of therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction.

METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors.

RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features.

DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and HypothesisStudies on schizophrenia feature diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate white matter (WM) anomalies. The heterogeneity in the possible interpretations of these metrics highlights the importance of increasing their specificity. Here, we characterize WM pathology in early psychosis (EP) and schizophrenia (SZ) with increased specificity using advanced dMRI metrics: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and White Matter Track Integrity - Watson (WMTI-W) biophysical model. This enables us to better characterize WM abnormalities and relate them to the patients symptomatology.

Study DesigndMRI-derived microstructure features were extracted from all of WM and from individual tracts in 275 individuals. 93 patients with EP and 47 with SZ were compared respectively to 135 age-range matched healthy controls (HC). The relationships between the dMRI metrics in WM and various clinical scales were investigated in each patient group.

Study ResultsWM diffusivities were higher, while kurtosis was lower in EP and SZ vs HC. Differences were more pronounced in EP than SZ. WMTI-W model parameters suggest alterations to the extra-axonal compartment in EP and SZ, consistent with abnormal myelin integrity and WM deterioration. Patient groups showed clustered but non-significant correlations between dMRI metrics and psychotic symptoms. Depressive dimensions were significantly associated with decreased diffusivities in WM, while manic scales correlated with increased diffusivities and reduced kurtosis.

ConclusionsdMRI patterns in EP and SZ highly suggest WM deterioration in comparison to HC. DMRI changes better align with affective dimensions, while the relationship with psychotic symptoms may be confounded by competing pathological effects on the microstructure and disease heterogeneity.</p>
