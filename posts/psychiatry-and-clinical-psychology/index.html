However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.\nFeeling at home in a virtually amputated body; Neural and phenomenological effects of illusory embodiment of the desired body in Body Integrity Dysphoria\nAuthors: Saetta, G.; Peter, Y.; Ruddy, K.; Ho, J.; Luechinger, R.; Michels, L.; Lenggenhager, B.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301812\nBody Integrity Dysphoria (BID) is characterized by a profound incongruity between the physical body and a desired, i.e., amputated body, often leading to a desire for limb amputation. Virtual reality (VR) intervention and multisensory stimulation paradigms provide powerful tools to enable transient, illusory embodiment of the desired body, thus experiencing a virtual amputation. This study investigates the impact of VR on neural responses in 18 individuals with BID compared to 18 age and sex matched healthy controls. We used both task-based and resting-state MRI to assess activity when viewing images of the body in the desired versus the undesired state before and after VR, along with functional connectivity measures. In VR, participants played a game with an amputated body, which was adapted for the BID group to simulate their desired bodily shape, seen from a first-person perspective and mimicking the participants leg movements. Compared to controls, individuals with BID demonstrated a stronger self-reported sense of ownership and control over the virtual body. Task-based fMRI results showed increased activity in the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), right angular gyrus, and right supplementary motor area pre-VR in the BID group, which normalized post-VR. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced connectivity in the rSPL, visuo-occipital areas, fronto-parietal, and fronto-striatal mirror and limb system networks pre-VR, also normalising post-VR. Additionally, there was a normalization in the pattern of increased connectivity of dopaminergic cortico-striatal tracts connecting the rSPL and the pars orbitalis of the right inferior frontal gyrus with the nucleus accumbens. Our findings suggest that virtual embodiment effectively modulates BID-related neural networks, potentially providing a controlled, cost-effective, and safe approach to address body dissatisfaction. They also underscore the significance of VR in unravelling the intricate relationship between the body and self, with potential implications for other psychiatric disorders of the bodily self.\nEnvironmental risk factors for self-harm during imprisonment: a prospective cohort study\nAuthors: Stephenson, T.; Harris, I.; Armstrong, C.; Fazel, S.; Short, R.; Blackwood, N.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.24302059\nIntroduction Self-harm is a major public health issue in the imprisoned population. Limited high-quality evidence exists for the potential impact of prison environmental factors such as solitary confinement. This pilot prospective cohort study in a large male remand prison in England sought to estimate effect sizes of a comprehensive range of prison environmental factors on self-harming behaviours. Methods A random sample of all prisoners (N=149) starting a period of imprisonment at the study prison took part in a clinical research interview, which assessed a range of known risk factors for self-harm in prison. Information concerning environmental factors, including staff numbers, cell placement and movements, and engagement in work and activities were collected from prison records. Incidents of self-harm behaviour in the 3 months after entering prison were measured using medical records and self-report at end of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated individually for each predictor. Results Single cell placement (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.06-18.24, p=0.041) and more frequent cellmate (OR 1.52, CI 1.14-2.17, p=0.009) and cell (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.86, p=0.003) changes were associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Unexpectedly, a lower staff-to-prisoner ratio (OR 0.89, CI 0.78-0.99, p=0.039) was also associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Following sensitivity analyses, the associations between frequent cell changes and self-harm behaviour, and between single cell placement and self-harm ideation, remained statistically significant. Discussion This pilot study provides prospective longitudinal data regarding relationships between prison environmental factors and self-harm behaviour. Findings regarding single cell accommodation and frequent cell changes are consistent with the prior evidence base largely derived from case-control study data. The finding regarding frequent cellmate changes predicting self-harm is novel. Findings regarding staff-prisoner ratio and self-harm most likely reflect a reverse causal relationship. Replication in larger cohort studies is required to address the limitations of this pilot study.\nBrain Functional Connectivity and Anatomical Features as Predictors of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Outcome for Anxiety in Youths\nAuthors: Zugman, A.; Ringlein, G. V.; Finn, E. S.; Lewis, K. M.; Berman, E.; Silverman, W.; Lebowitz, E. R.; Pine, D. S.; Winkler, A. M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301959\nBackgroundBecause pediatric anxiety disorders precede the onset of many other problems, successful prediction of response to the first-line treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), could have major impact. However, existing clinical models are weakly predictive. The current study evaluates whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict post-CBT anxiety symptoms. MethodsTwo datasets were studied: (A) one consisted of n=54 subjects with an anxiety diagnosis, who received 12 weeks of CBT, and (B) one consisted of n=15 subjects treated for 8 weeks. Connectome Predictive Modeling (CPM) was used to predict treatment response, as assessed with the PARS; additionally we investigated models using anatomical features, instead of functional connectivity. The main analysis included network edges positively correlated with treatment outcome, and age, sex, and baseline anxiety severity as predictors. Results from alternative models and analyses also are presented. Model assessments utilized 1000 bootstraps, resulting in a 95% CI for R2, r and mean absolute error (MAE). OutcomesThe main model showed a mean absolute error of approximately 3.5 (95%CI: [3.1-3.8]) points a R2 of 0.08 [-0.14 - 0.26] and r of 0.38 [0.24 - 0.511]. When testing this model in the left-out sample (B) the results were similar, with a MAE of 3.4 [2.8 - 4.7], R2 -0.65 [-2.29 - 0.16] and r of 0.4 [0.24 - 0.54]. The anatomical metrics showed a similar pattern, where models rendered overall low R2. InterpretationThe analysis showed that models based on earlier promising results failed to predict clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample size, the current study does not support extensive use of CPM to predict outcome in pediatric anxiety.\nLongitudinal pathways between maternal depression, parenting behaviors, and early childhood development: a mediation analysis\nAuthors: Frost, A.; Scherer, E.; Chung, E.; Gallis, J. A.; Sanborn, K.; Zhou, Y.; Hagaman, A.; LeMasters, K.; Sikander, S.; Turner, E. L.; Maselko, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301747\nMaternal depression is a global public health concern with far-reaching impacts on child development, yet our understanding of mechanisms remains incomplete. This study examined whether parenting mediates the association between maternal depression and child outcomes. Participants included 841 rural Pakistani mother-child dyads (50% female). Maternal depression was measured at 12 months postpartum, parenting behaviors (warmth, stimulation, and harsh parenting) were measured at 24 months, and child outcomes (mental health, socioemotional development, and cognitive skills) were measured at 36 months. Maternal depression predicted increased harsh parenting, child mental health difficulties, and child socioemotional concerns; however, there was little evidence for parenting as a mediator between maternal depression and child outcomes. Sex-stratified results are discussed, and findings are situated in context.\nEsketamine-induced post-traumatic stress disorder flashbacks during treatment-resistant depression indication: is it just a side effect?\nAuthors: Rotharmel, M.; Mekaoui, L.; Kazour, F.; Herrero, M.; Beetz-Lobono, E.-M.; Lengvenyte, A.; Holtzmann, J.; Raynaud, P.; Cuenca, M.; Bulteau, S.; de Maricourt, P.; Husson, T.; Olie, E.; Gohier, B.; Sauvaget, A.; Gaillard, R.; Richieri, R.; Szekely, D.; Samalin, L.; Guillin, O.; Moulier, V.; El-Hage, W.; Laurin, A.; Berkovitch, L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24300998\nBackgroundPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and frequent affection that is highly comorbid to major depressive disorder. Comorbid PTSD and depression are usually treatment-resistant, with a high risk of functional impairment and suicide. Esketamine nasal spray is a recent validated treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but its efficacy on comorbid TRD-PTSD remains insufficiently documented. In particular, flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration and their influence on clinical outcomes is unknown. ObjectivesOur main objective was to describe esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks and their impact on clinical trajectories within a sample of patients with comorbid TRD-PTSD. MethodsWe retrospectively collected clinical data of patients receiving esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD who experienced at least one flashback of their trauma during esketamine sessions across 11 psychiatric departments. ResultsBetween February 2020 and March 2023, 22 adult patients with TRD met inclusion criteria. In sixteen patients (72.7%) flashbacks disappeared as the sessions progressed. In six patients (27.3%), esketamine treatment was stopped because of persistent flashbacks. When esketamine was continued, clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD (depression response rate: 45.5% and remission rate: 22.7%; PTSD response rate: 45.5% and remission: 18.2%). LimitationsThe retrospective design of the study and the absence of a comparator group are the main limitations of our study. ConclusionsOur results suggest that the occurrence of esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder clinical response. On the contrary, when managed appropriately and combined with targeted psychotherapy, it could even contribute to positive outcomes. HighlightsO_LIEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression C_LIO_LIIts efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder is poorly documented. C_LIO_LITraumatic flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration. C_LIO_LIEsketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder its clinical response. C_LI Clinical impact statementEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Its efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is poorly documented. In this study, we reported the data of 22 adult patients who received esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD and experienced flashbacks during esketamine sessions. These flashbacks did not appear to be a contreindication to the administration of esketamine and clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD. Our results suggest that esketamine could be safely administered to patients with comorbid PTSD and TRD and that esketamine could lead to a substantial improvement in this population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry. However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Body Integrity Dysphoria (BID) is characterized by a profound incongruity between the physical body and a desired, i.e., amputated body, often leading to a desire for limb amputation. Virtual reality (VR) intervention and multisensory stimulation paradigms provide powerful tools to enable transient, illusory embodiment of the desired body, thus experiencing a virtual amputation.

This study investigates the impact of VR on neural responses in 18 individuals with BID compared to 18 age and sex matched healthy controls. We used both task-based and resting-state MRI to assess activity when viewing images of the body in the desired versus the undesired state before and after VR, along with functional connectivity measures. In VR, participants played a game with an amputated body, which was adapted for the BID group to simulate their desired bodily shape, seen from a first-person perspective and mimicking the participants leg movements.

Compared to controls, individuals with BID demonstrated a stronger self-reported sense of ownership and control over the virtual body. Task-based fMRI results showed increased activity in the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), right angular gyrus, and right supplementary motor area pre-VR in the BID group, which normalized post-VR. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced connectivity in the rSPL, visuo-occipital areas, fronto-parietal, and fronto-striatal mirror and limb system networks pre-VR, also normalising post-VR. Additionally, there was a normalization in the pattern of increased connectivity of dopaminergic cortico-striatal tracts connecting the rSPL and the pars orbitalis of the right inferior frontal gyrus with the nucleus accumbens.

Our findings suggest that virtual embodiment effectively modulates BID-related neural networks, potentially providing a controlled, cost-effective, and safe approach to address body dissatisfaction. They also underscore the significance of VR in unravelling the intricate relationship between the body and self, with potential implications for other psychiatric disorders of the bodily self.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction Self-harm is a major public health issue in the imprisoned population. Limited high-quality evidence exists for the potential impact of prison environmental factors such as solitary confinement. This pilot prospective cohort study in a large male remand prison in England sought to estimate effect sizes of a comprehensive range of prison environmental factors on self-harming behaviours. Methods A random sample of all prisoners (N=149) starting a period of imprisonment at the study prison took part in a clinical research interview, which assessed a range of known risk factors for self-harm in prison. Information concerning environmental factors, including staff numbers, cell placement and movements, and engagement in work and activities were collected from prison records. Incidents of self-harm behaviour in the 3 months after entering prison were measured using medical records and self-report at end of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated individually for each predictor. Results Single cell placement (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.06-18.24, p=0.041) and more frequent cellmate (OR 1.52, CI 1.14-2.17, p=0.009) and cell (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.86, p=0.003) changes were associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Unexpectedly, a lower staff-to-prisoner ratio (OR 0.89, CI 0.78-0.99, p=0.039) was also associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Following sensitivity analyses, the associations between frequent cell changes and self-harm behaviour, and between single cell placement and self-harm ideation, remained statistically significant. Discussion This pilot study provides prospective longitudinal data regarding relationships between prison environmental factors and self-harm behaviour. Findings regarding single cell accommodation and frequent cell changes are consistent with the prior evidence base largely derived from case-control study data. The finding regarding frequent cellmate changes predicting self-harm is novel. Findings regarding staff-prisoner ratio and self-harm most likely reflect a reverse causal relationship. Replication in larger cohort studies is required to address the limitations of this pilot study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBecause pediatric anxiety disorders precede the onset of many other problems, successful prediction of response to the first-line treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), could have major impact. However, existing clinical models are weakly predictive. The current study evaluates whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict post-CBT anxiety symptoms.

MethodsTwo datasets were studied: (A) one consisted of n=54 subjects with an anxiety diagnosis, who received 12 weeks of CBT, and (B) one consisted of n=15 subjects treated for 8 weeks. Connectome Predictive Modeling (CPM) was used to predict treatment response, as assessed with the PARS; additionally we investigated models using anatomical features, instead of functional connectivity. The main analysis included network edges positively correlated with treatment outcome, and age, sex, and baseline anxiety severity as predictors. Results from alternative models and analyses also are presented. Model assessments utilized 1000 bootstraps, resulting in a 95% CI for R2, r and mean absolute error (MAE).

OutcomesThe main model showed a mean absolute error of approximately 3.5 (95%CI: [3.1-3.8]) points a R2 of 0.08 [-0.14 - 0.26] and r of 0.38 [0.24 - 0.511]. When testing this model in the left-out sample (B) the results were similar, with a MAE of 3.4 [2.8 - 4.7], R2 -0.65 [-2.29 - 0.16] and r of 0.4 [0.24 - 0.54]. The anatomical metrics showed a similar pattern, where models rendered overall low R2.

InterpretationThe analysis showed that models based on earlier promising results failed to predict clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample size, the current study does not support extensive use of CPM to predict outcome in pediatric anxiety.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Maternal depression is a global public health concern with far-reaching impacts on child development, yet our understanding of mechanisms remains incomplete. This study examined whether parenting mediates the association between maternal depression and child outcomes. Participants included 841 rural Pakistani mother-child dyads (50% female). Maternal depression was measured at 12 months postpartum, parenting behaviors (warmth, stimulation, and harsh parenting) were measured at 24 months, and child outcomes (mental health, socioemotional development, and cognitive skills) were measured at 36 months. Maternal depression predicted increased harsh parenting, child mental health difficulties, and child socioemotional concerns; however, there was little evidence for parenting as a mediator between maternal depression and child outcomes. Sex-stratified results are discussed, and findings are situated in context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and frequent affection that is highly comorbid to major depressive disorder. Comorbid PTSD and depression are usually treatment-resistant, with a high risk of functional impairment and suicide. Esketamine nasal spray is a recent validated treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but its efficacy on comorbid TRD-PTSD remains insufficiently documented. In particular, flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration and their influence on clinical outcomes is unknown.

ObjectivesOur main objective was to describe esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks and their impact on clinical trajectories within a sample of patients with comorbid TRD-PTSD.

MethodsWe retrospectively collected clinical data of patients receiving esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD who experienced at least one flashback of their trauma during esketamine sessions across 11 psychiatric departments.

ResultsBetween February 2020 and March 2023, 22 adult patients with TRD met inclusion criteria. In sixteen patients (72.7%) flashbacks disappeared as the sessions progressed. In six patients (27.3%), esketamine treatment was stopped because of persistent flashbacks. When esketamine was continued, clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD (depression response rate: 45.5% and remission rate: 22.7%; PTSD response rate: 45.5% and remission: 18.2%).

LimitationsThe retrospective design of the study and the absence of a comparator group are the main limitations of our study.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the occurrence of esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder clinical response. On the contrary, when managed appropriately and combined with targeted psychotherapy, it could even contribute to positive outcomes.

Clinical impact statementEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Its efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is poorly documented. In this study, we reported the data of 22 adult patients who received esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD and experienced flashbacks during esketamine sessions. These flashbacks did not appear to be a contreindication to the administration of esketamine and clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD. Our results suggest that esketamine could be safely administered to patients with comorbid PTSD and TRD and that esketamine could lead to a substantial improvement in this population.</p>
