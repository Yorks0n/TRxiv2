These two perspectives map onto the ways in which executive function is measured in childhood - using either structured laboratory tasks or ratings of everyday behaviours. Differences in executive functioning are associated with neurodevelopmental differences, but evidence for associations between specific profiles of executive function and specific neurodevelopmental conditions is mixed. In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify common profiles of executive function in a transdiagnostic sample of 566 neurodivergent children, using both performance and rating-based measures of executive function. Three profiles of executive function were identified: one had consistent difficulties across both types of assessments, while the other two had inconsistent profiles of predominantly rating- or predominantly task-based difficulties. Children with these different profiles had differences in academic achievement and mental health outcomes and could further be differentiated from a comparison group of neurotypical children on both shared and profile-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Importantly, childrens executive function profiles were not directly related to diagnostic categories or to dimensions of neurodiversity associated with specific diagnoses (e.g., hyperactivity, inattention, social communication). These findings support the idea that there are separate domains of executive function and that the two types of assessment tapping these functions are dissociable and provide non-redundant information related to neurodevelopmental differences. These findings advance our understanding of executive function profiles in neurodivergent populations and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neural variation.\nChronic oxytocin administration stimulates the endogenous oxytocin system: an RCT in autistic children\nAuthors: Moerkerke, M.; Daniels, N.; Tibermont, L.; Tang, T.; Evenepoel, M.; Van der Donck, S.; Debbaut, E.; Prinsen, J.; Chubar, V.; Claes, S.; Vanaudenaerde, B.; Willems, L.; Steyaert, J.; Boets, B.; Alaerts, K.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-06-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.06.23291017\nBackgroundClinical efficacy of chronic intranasal administration of oxytocin is increasingly explored in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but to date, little is known regarding its biological effects and in particular how chronic administration regimes impact endogenous oxytocinergic function. MethodsTo fill this gap, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study explored chronic oxytocin administration effects on endogenous salivary oxytocin levels and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA methylation) in 8-to-12-year-old children with ASD (n = 79, 16 females). Biological sampling was performed at baseline (pre-treatment), immediately (24 hours) after the four-week oxytocin administration period (12 IU, twice daily) and at a follow-up session, four weeks after the last nasal spray administration. ResultsCompared to placebo, children receiving the oxytocin nasal spray displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at the four-week follow up session. Regarding epigenetics, oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR methylation were observed, reflecting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment. ConclusionFour weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with ASD, as evidenced by increased salivary oxytocin levels and reduced OXTR DNA methylation (indicating increased receptor expression).\nSpatiotemporal dynamics of hippocampal-cortical networks underlying the unique phenomenological properties of trauma-related intrusive memories\nAuthors: Clancy, K. J.; Devignes, Q.; Ren, B.; Pollmann, Y.; Nielsen, S. R.; Howell, K.; Kumar, P.; Belleau, E. L.; Rosso, I. M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291671\nTrauma-related intrusive memories (TR-IMs) possess unique phenomenological properties that contribute to adverse post-traumatic outcomes, positioning them as critical intervention targets. However, transdiagnostic treatments for TR-IMs are scarce, as their underlying mechanisms have been investigated separate from their unique phenomenological properties. Extant models of more general episodic memory highlight dynamic hippocampal-cortical interactions that vary along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus (HPC) to support different cognitive-affective and sensory-perceptual features of memory. Extending this work into the unique properties of TR-IMs, we conducted a study of eighty-four trauma-exposed adults who completed daily ecological momentary assessments of TR-IM properties followed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Spatiotemporal dynamics of anterior and posterior hippocampal (a/pHPC)-cortical networks were assessed using co-activation pattern analysis to investigate their associations with different properties of TR-IMs. Emotional intensity of TR-IMs was inversely associated with the frequency and persistence of an aHPC-default mode network co-activation pattern. Conversely, sensory features of TR-IMs were associated with more frequent co-activation of the HPC with sensory cortices and the ventral attention network, and the reliving of TR-IMs in the \"here-and-now\" was associated with more persistent co-activation of the pHPC and the visual cortex. Notably, no associations were found between HPC-cortical network dynamics and conventional symptom measures, including TR-IM frequency or retrospective recall, underscoring the utility of ecological assessments of memory properties in identifying the neural substrates of memory properties. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the unique features of TR-IMs that are critical for the development of individualized, transdiagnostic treatments for this pervasive, difficult-to-treat symptom.\nUsing Polygenic Scores for Circadian Rhythm to predict Wellbeing, Depressive Symptoms, Chronotype, and Health\nAuthors: Landvreugd, A.; Pool, R.; Nivard, M. G.; Bartels, M.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-06-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.23290377\nThe association between the circadian rhythm and diseases has been well-established, while the association with mental health is less explored. Given the heritable nature of the circadian rhythm, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between genes underlying the circadian rhythm and mental health outcomes, as well as a possible gene-environment correlation for circadian rhythm. In a sample from the Netherlands Twin Register (N = 14,021), polygenic scores (PGSs) were calculated for two circadian rhythm measures: Morningess and Relative Amplitude. The PGSs were used to predict mental health outcomes such as subjective happiness, quality of life, and depressive symptoms In addition, we performed the same prediction analysis in a within-family design in a subset of dizygotic twins. The PGS for Morningness significantly predicted Morningness (R2 = 1.55%,) and Depressive Symptoms (R2= 0.22%,). The PGS for Relative Amplitude significantly predicted General Health (R2 = 0.12%,) and Depressive Symptoms (R2 = 0.20%,). Item analysis of the depressive symptoms showed that 4/14 items were significantly associated with the PGSs. The within-family results hinted at a gene-environment correlation for Morningness. Overall, the results showed that people with a genetic predisposition of being a morning person or a high relative amplitude are likely to have fewer depressive symptoms. Contrarily to our hypotheses, the four associated depressive symptoms described symptoms related to decision-making, energy, and feeling worthless, rather than sleep. Our findings plead for a substantial role for the circadian rhythm in depression research, and to further explore the gene-environment correlation in the circadian rhythm.\nCaudate Volume is Prospectively Associated with Irritability in Toddlerhood\nAuthors: Dufford, A. J.; MacNeill, L.; Nielsen, A. N.; Smyser, C.; Luby, J.; Rogers, C.; Norton, E.; Wakschlag, L.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.23291514\nIrritability refers to the dispositional tendency toward angry emotion with both mood and behavioral elements. The dimensional spectrum of irritability is an RDoC-informed transdiagnostic marker of psychopathology risk, specifically the common and modifiable internalizing and externalizing disorders. Despite substantial interest in this robust developmentally based transdiagnostic indicator of psychopathology risk, its early brain markers are understudied. Here, we present data (n=31) from an imaging sub-study of the When to Worry study, in which we examined prospective associations between volume in three subcortical regions implicated in irritability (the caudate, putamen, and amygdala) around the infants first birthday (Baseline) and the dimensional spectrum of observed irritability using the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS) around toddlers second birthday (Follow-up). Both left (q\u003c.04, FDR corrected) and right caudate volumes (q\u003c.04, FDR corrected) at Baseline were negatively associated with a measure of irritability measured at Follow-up. We did not find support for associations between putamen and amygdala volumes at Baseline and observed irritability at Follow-up. These findings identify early prospective neuroanatomical correlates of toddler irritability and provide preliminary support for the caudate being an important brain region for understanding the developmental sequalae of irritability.\nRandomized Trial of Ketamine Masked by Surgical Anesthesia in Depressed Patients\nAuthors: Lii, T. R.; Smith, A. E.; Flohr, J. R.; Okada, R. L.; Nyongesa, C. A.; Cianfichi, L. J.; Hack, L. M.; Schatzberg, A. F.; Heifets, B. D.\nScore: 358.3, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.28.23289210\nBACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials. METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([\u0026ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received. RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration. CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

F.; Abo Algon, A. A.; Maes, M. F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291597\nBackground: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Negative Life Events (NLEs) may activate immune-inflammatory pathways, which play a role in the onset of Major Depressive Disorder and its severe phenotype Major Dysmood disorder (MDMD). Objectives: To assess if elevated ACEs and NLEs in first episode (FE)-MDMD predict activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), chemokines, and growth factors that participate in the pathophysiology of MDMD. Methods: This research assessed the effects of ACEs and NLEs on forty-eight cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, in 71 FE-MDMD patients and forty heathy controls. Results: ACEs are highly significantly associated with the classical M1 macrophage, T helper (Th)-1, Th-1 polarization, IRS, and neurotoxicity immune profiles, and not with the alternative M2, and Th-2 immune profiles. There are highly significant correlations between ACEs and NLEs and different cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, especially with interleukin (IL)-16, CCL27, stem cell growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 62.3% of the variance in the depression phenome (based on severity of depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviors) was explained by the regression on IL-4 (p=0.001, inversely), the sum of ACEs + NLEs (p\u003c0.0001), and a vector extracted from 10 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (p\u003c0.0001; both positively associated). The latter partially mediated (p\u003c0.0001) the effects of ACE + NLEs on the depression phenome. Conclusions: Part of the effects of ACEs and NLEs on the depression phenome is mediated via activation of immune and growth factor networks. These pathways have a stronger impact in subjects with lowered activities of the compensatory immune-regulatory system.\nX- vs. Y-Chromosome Influences on Human Behavior: A Deep Phenotypic Comparison of Psychopathology in XXY and XYY Syndromes\nAuthors: Schaffer, L.; Rau, S.; Clasen, L.; Warling, A.; Whitman, E. T.; Nadig, A.; McDermott, C.; Xenophontos, A.; Wilson, K.; Blumenthal, J.; Torres, E.; Raznahan, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.23291614\nDo different genetic disorders impart different psychiatric risk profiles? This question has major implications for biological and translational aspects of psychiatry, but has been difficult to tackle given limited access to shared batteries of fine-grained clinical data across genetic disorders. Using a new suite of generalizable analytic approaches, we examine gold-standard diagnostic ratings, scores on 66 dimensional measures of psychopathology, and measures of cognition and functioning in two different sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) - Klinefelter (XXY/KS) and XYY syndrome (n=102 and 64 vs. n=74 and 60 matched XY controls, total n=300). We focus on SCAs for their high collective prevalence, informativeness regarding differential X- vs. Y-chromosome effects, and potential relevance for normative sex differences. We show that XXY/KS elevates rates for most psychiatric diagnoses as previously reported for XYY, but disproportionately so for anxiety disorders. Fine-mapping across all 66 traits provides a detailed profile of psychopathology in XXY/KS which is strongly correlated with that of XYY (r=.75 across traits) and robust to ascertainment biases, but reveals: (i) a greater penetrance of XYY than KS/XXY for most traits except mood/anxiety problems, and (ii) a disproportionate impact of XYY vs. XXY/KS on social problems. XXY/KS and XXY showed a similar coupling of psychopathology with adaptive function and caregiver strain, but not IQ. This work provides new tools for deep-phenotypic comparisons of genetic disorders in psychiatry and uses these to detail unique and shared effects of the X- and Y-chromosome on human behavior.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Executive functions can be conceptualised as either a set of higher-order cognitive skills that enable us to engage in flexible thinking and regulate our thoughts and behaviours, or as the ability to integrate knowledge, beliefs, and values when applying cognitive control in everyday situations. These two perspectives map onto the ways in which executive function is measured in childhood - using either structured laboratory tasks or ratings of everyday behaviours. Differences in executive functioning are associated with neurodevelopmental differences, but evidence for associations between specific profiles of executive function and specific neurodevelopmental conditions is mixed. In this study, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify common profiles of executive function in a transdiagnostic sample of 566 neurodivergent children, using both performance and rating-based measures of executive function. Three profiles of executive function were identified: one had consistent difficulties across both types of assessments, while the other two had inconsistent profiles of predominantly rating- or predominantly task-based difficulties. Children with these different profiles had differences in academic achievement and mental health outcomes and could further be differentiated from a comparison group of neurotypical children on both shared and profile-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Importantly, childrens executive function profiles were not directly related to diagnostic categories or to dimensions of neurodiversity associated with specific diagnoses (e.g., hyperactivity, inattention, social communication). These findings support the idea that there are separate domains of executive function and that the two types of assessment tapping these functions are dissociable and provide non-redundant information related to neurodevelopmental differences. These findings advance our understanding of executive function profiles in neurodivergent populations and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neural variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundClinical efficacy of chronic intranasal administration of oxytocin is increasingly explored in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but to date, little is known regarding its biological effects and in particular how chronic administration regimes impact endogenous oxytocinergic function.

MethodsTo fill this gap, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study explored chronic oxytocin administration effects on endogenous salivary oxytocin levels and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) epigenetics (DNA methylation) in 8-to-12-year-old children with ASD (n = 79, 16 females). Biological sampling was performed at baseline (pre-treatment), immediately (24 hours) after the four-week oxytocin administration period (12 IU, twice daily) and at a follow-up session, four weeks after the last nasal spray administration.

ResultsCompared to placebo, children receiving the oxytocin nasal spray displayed significantly higher salivary oxytocin levels 24 hours after the last oxytocin nasal spray administration, but no longer at the four-week follow up session. Regarding epigenetics, oxytocin-induced reductions in OXTR methylation were observed, reflecting a facilitation of oxytocin receptor expression in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group. Notably, heightened oxytocin levels post-treatment were significantly associated with reduced OXTR DNA methylation and improved feelings of secure attachment.

ConclusionFour weeks of chronic oxytocin administration stimulated the endogenous oxytocinergic system in children with ASD, as evidenced by increased salivary oxytocin levels and reduced OXTR DNA methylation (indicating increased receptor expression).</p>

        <p class="abstract">Trauma-related intrusive memories (TR-IMs) possess unique phenomenological properties that contribute to adverse post-traumatic outcomes, positioning them as critical intervention targets. However, transdiagnostic treatments for TR-IMs are scarce, as their underlying mechanisms have been investigated separate from their unique phenomenological properties. Extant models of more general episodic memory highlight dynamic hippocampal-cortical interactions that vary along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus (HPC) to support different cognitive-affective and sensory-perceptual features of memory. Extending this work into the unique properties of TR-IMs, we conducted a study of eighty-four trauma-exposed adults who completed daily ecological momentary assessments of TR-IM properties followed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Spatiotemporal dynamics of anterior and posterior hippocampal (a/pHPC)-cortical networks were assessed using co-activation pattern analysis to investigate their associations with different properties of TR-IMs. Emotional intensity of TR-IMs was inversely associated with the frequency and persistence of an aHPC-default mode network co-activation pattern. Conversely, sensory features of TR-IMs were associated with more frequent co-activation of the HPC with sensory cortices and the ventral attention network, and the reliving of TR-IMs in the &#34;here-and-now&#34; was associated with more persistent co-activation of the pHPC and the visual cortex. Notably, no associations were found between HPC-cortical network dynamics and conventional symptom measures, including TR-IM frequency or retrospective recall, underscoring the utility of ecological assessments of memory properties in identifying the neural substrates of memory properties. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the unique features of TR-IMs that are critical for the development of individualized, transdiagnostic treatments for this pervasive, difficult-to-treat symptom.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The association between the circadian rhythm and diseases has been well-established, while the association with mental health is less explored. Given the heritable nature of the circadian rhythm, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between genes underlying the circadian rhythm and mental health outcomes, as well as a possible gene-environment correlation for circadian rhythm. In a sample from the Netherlands Twin Register (N = 14,021), polygenic scores (PGSs) were calculated for two circadian rhythm measures: Morningess and Relative Amplitude. The PGSs were used to predict mental health outcomes such as subjective happiness, quality of life, and depressive symptoms In addition, we performed the same prediction analysis in a within-family design in a subset of dizygotic twins. The PGS for Morningness significantly predicted Morningness (R2 = 1.55%,) and Depressive Symptoms (R2= 0.22%,). The PGS for Relative Amplitude significantly predicted General Health (R2 = 0.12%,) and Depressive Symptoms (R2 = 0.20%,). Item analysis of the depressive symptoms showed that 4/14 items were significantly associated with the PGSs. The within-family results hinted at a gene-environment correlation for Morningness. Overall, the results showed that people with a genetic predisposition of being a morning person or a high relative amplitude are likely to have fewer depressive symptoms. Contrarily to our hypotheses, the four associated depressive symptoms described symptoms related to decision-making, energy, and feeling worthless, rather than sleep. Our findings plead for a substantial role for the circadian rhythm in depression research, and to further explore the gene-environment correlation in the circadian rhythm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Irritability refers to the dispositional tendency toward angry emotion with both mood and behavioral elements. The dimensional spectrum of irritability is an RDoC-informed transdiagnostic marker of psychopathology risk, specifically the common and modifiable internalizing and externalizing disorders. Despite substantial interest in this robust developmentally based transdiagnostic indicator of psychopathology risk, its early brain markers are understudied. Here, we present data (n=31) from an imaging sub-study of the When to Worry study, in which we examined prospective associations between volume in three subcortical regions implicated in irritability (the caudate, putamen, and amygdala) around the infants first birthday (Baseline) and the dimensional spectrum of observed irritability using the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS) around toddlers second birthday (Follow-up). Both left (q&lt;.04, FDR corrected) and right caudate volumes (q&lt;.04, FDR corrected) at Baseline were negatively associated with a measure of irritability measured at Follow-up. We did not find support for associations between putamen and amygdala volumes at Baseline and observed irritability at Follow-up. These findings identify early prospective neuroanatomical correlates of toddler irritability and provide preliminary support for the caudate being an important brain region for understanding the developmental sequalae of irritability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials.

METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([&amp;ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received.

RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration.

CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

        <p class="abstract">Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Negative Life Events (NLEs) may activate immune-inflammatory pathways, which play a role in the onset of Major Depressive Disorder and its severe phenotype Major Dysmood disorder (MDMD). Objectives: To assess if elevated ACEs and NLEs in first episode (FE)-MDMD predict activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), chemokines, and growth factors that participate in the pathophysiology of MDMD. Methods: This research assessed the effects of ACEs and NLEs on forty-eight cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, in 71 FE-MDMD patients and forty heathy controls. Results: ACEs are highly significantly associated with the classical M1 macrophage, T helper (Th)-1, Th-1 polarization, IRS, and neurotoxicity immune profiles, and not with the alternative M2, and Th-2 immune profiles. There are highly significant correlations between ACEs and NLEs and different cytokines/chemokines/growth factors, especially with interleukin (IL)-16, CCL27, stem cell growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 62.3% of the variance in the depression phenome (based on severity of depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviors) was explained by the regression on IL-4 (p=0.001, inversely), the sum of ACEs &#43; NLEs (p&lt;0.0001), and a vector extracted from 10 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (p&lt;0.0001; both positively associated). The latter partially mediated (p&lt;0.0001) the effects of ACE &#43; NLEs on the depression phenome. Conclusions: Part of the effects of ACEs and NLEs on the depression phenome is mediated via activation of immune and growth factor networks. These pathways have a stronger impact in subjects with lowered activities of the compensatory immune-regulatory system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Do different genetic disorders impart different psychiatric risk profiles? This question has major implications for biological and translational aspects of psychiatry, but has been difficult to tackle given limited access to shared batteries of fine-grained clinical data across genetic disorders. Using a new suite of generalizable analytic approaches, we examine gold-standard diagnostic ratings, scores on 66 dimensional measures of psychopathology, and measures of cognition and functioning in two different sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) - Klinefelter (XXY/KS) and XYY syndrome (n=102 and 64 vs. n=74 and 60 matched XY controls, total n=300). We focus on SCAs for their high collective prevalence, informativeness regarding differential X- vs. Y-chromosome effects, and potential relevance for normative sex differences. We show that XXY/KS elevates rates for most psychiatric diagnoses as previously reported for XYY, but disproportionately so for anxiety disorders. Fine-mapping across all 66 traits provides a detailed profile of psychopathology in XXY/KS which is strongly correlated with that of XYY (r=.75 across traits) and robust to ascertainment biases, but reveals: (i) a greater penetrance of XYY than KS/XXY for most traits except mood/anxiety problems, and (ii) a disproportionate impact of XYY vs. XXY/KS on social problems. XXY/KS and XXY showed a similar coupling of psychopathology with adaptive function and caregiver strain, but not IQ. This work provides new tools for deep-phenotypic comparisons of genetic disorders in psychiatry and uses these to detail unique and shared effects of the X- and Y-chromosome on human behavior.</p>
