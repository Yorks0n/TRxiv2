Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children. MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level. ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children. DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.\nA Systematic Review of Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Childbirth\nAuthors: Dekel, S.; Papadakis, J. E.; Quagliarini, B.; Jagodnik, K. M.; Nandru, R.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294230\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD. Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment. Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded. Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form. ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce. ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

While brain development in youths has been studied mostly from an age perspective, recent evidence suggests that pubertal measures may be more sensitive to study adolescent neurodevelopment, however, studies on pubertal timing in relation to brain development are still scarce. MethodsWe investigated if pre- vs. post-menarche status can be classified using machine learning on cortical and subcortical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from strictly age-matched adolescent females from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. For comparison of the identified menarche-related patterns to age-related patterns of neurodevelopment, we trained a brain age prediction model on data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and applied it to the same ABCD data, yielding differences between predicted and chronological age referred to as brain age gaps. We tested the sensitivity of both these frameworks to measures of pubertal maturation, specifically age at menarche and puberty status. ResultsThe machine learning model achieved moderate but statistically significant accuracy in the menarche classification task, yielding for each subject a class probability ranging from 0 (pre-) to 1 (post-menarche). Comparison to brain age predictions revealed shared and distinct patterns of neurodevelopment captured by both approaches. Continuous menarche class probabilities were positively associated with brain age gaps, but only the menarche class probabilities - not the brain age gaps - were associated with age at menarche. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the use of a machine learning model to classify menarche status from structural MRI data while accounting for age-related neurodevelopment. Given its sensitivity towards measures of puberty timing, our work suggests that menarche class probabilities may be developed toward an objective brain-based marker of pubertal development. Highlights{checkmark} We classified pre- vs. post-menarche status in adolescent females from structural brain imaging data {checkmark}We compared class probabilities to brain-age predictions to disentangle puberty- vs. age-related patterns of brain development {checkmark}The derived continuous brain-based menarche class probabilities captured shared but also unique variations of adolescent neurodevelopment, and were associated with pubertal timing and status Plain English SummaryPuberty is a period of substantial changes in the life of youths, and these include profound brain changes. Most studies have investigated age related changes in brain development, recent work however suggests that looking at brain development through the lens of pubertal development can provide additional insights beyond age effects. We here analyzed brain imaging data from a group of same-aged adolescent girls from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Our goal was to investigate if we could determine from brain images whether a girl had started her menstrual period (menarche) or not, and we used machine learning to classify between them. This machine learning model does not just return a \"yes/no\" decision, but also returns a number between 0 and 1 indicating a probability to be pre- (0) or post- (1) menarche. To rule out, that our approach only maps age-related development, we selected a strictly age-matched sample of girls and compared our classification model to a brain age model trained on independent individuals. Our model classified between pre- and post-menarche with moderate accuracy. The obtained class probability was partly related to age-related brain development, but only the probability was significantly associated with pubertal timing (age at menarche). In summary, our study uses a machine learning model to estimate whether a girl has reached menarche based on her brain structure. This approach offers new insights into the connection between puberty and brain development and might serve as an objective way to assess pubertal timing from imaging data.\nEffect of lifetime exposure to depression on brain structure and function in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Kasper, J.; Eickhoff, S.; Patil, K. R.; Dukart, J.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294887\nBackgroundDepression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort. MethodsWe included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume. ResultsAcross all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations. ConclusionLifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.\nSex-stratified genomic structural equation models of posttraumatic stress inform PTSD etiology\nAuthors: Moo-Choy, A.; Stein, M.; Gelernter, J.; Wendt, F. R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294954\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 3.9%-5.6% of the worldwide population, with well-documented sex-related differences. While psychosocial and hormonal factors affecting sex differences in PTSD and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom etiology have been explored, there has been limited focus on genetic bases of these differences. Many symptom combinations may confer a PTSD diagnosis. We hypothesized that these symptom combinations have sex-specific patterns, the examination of which could inform etiological differences in PTSD genetics between males and females. To investigate this, we performed a sex-stratified multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) in unrelated UK Biobank (UKB) individuals of European ancestry. Using GWAS summary association data, genomic structural equation modeling was performed to generate sex-specific factor models using six indicator variables: trouble concentrating, feeling distant from others, irritability, disturbing thoughts, upset feelings, and avoidance of places/activities which remind the individual of a traumatic event. Models of male and female PTSD symptoms differed substantially (local standardized root mean square difference=3.12) and significantly ({chi}2(5)=28.03, p=3.6x10-5). Independent two-factor models best fit the data in both males and females; these factors were subjected to GWAS in each sex, revealing three genome-wide significant loci in females, mapping to SCAND3, WDPCP, and FAM120A. No genome-wide significant loci were identified in males. All four PTS factors (2 in males and 2 in females) were heritable (p\u003c0.05): male PTS-f1 h2-SNP=1.85%, male PTS-f2 h2-SNP=1.47%, female PTS-f1 h2-SNP=3.87%, female PTS-f2 h2-SNP=3.53%. Male PTS-f1 was enriched for medication-related putative causal relationships (3.73-fold, p=0.032) while male PTS-f2 was enriched for body structure (2.84-fold, p=5.512x10-7) and cognitive (3.22-fold, p=0.009) putative causal relationships. In females, PTS-f1 was enriched for metabolic putative causal relationships (28.08-fold, p=0.035). By assessing the relationship between sex and PTSD symptoms, this study informs correlative and putatively causal etiological differences between males and females which support further investigation of sex differences in PTSD genetics.\nComorbidity Profiles of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Across the Medical Phenome\nAuthors: Hicks, E. M.; Niarchou, M.; Goleva, S.; Kabir, D.; Ciarcia, J.; PTSD \u0026 Trauma EHR Working Group, ; Smoller, J.; Davis, L.; Nievergelt, C.; Koenen, K.; Huckins, L. M.; Choi, K. W.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294572\nBackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex. MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1+ PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2+ PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression. ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients. ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.\nUnravelling the influence of affective stimulation on functional neurological symptoms: A pilot experiment examining potential mechanisms\nAuthors: Pick, S.; Millman, L. S. M.; Ward, E.; Short, E.; Stanton, B. R.; Reinders, A. A. T. S.; Winston, J. S.; Nicholson, T. R.; Edwards, M. J.; Goldstein, L. H.; David, A. S.; Chalder, T.; Hotopf, M.; Mehta, M. A.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294462\nBackgroundDifferences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored. MethodsIndividuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (\"Watch\") or detaching themselves (\"Distance\"). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously. ResultsFNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, {eta}p2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, {eta}p2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, {eta}p2: \u003c0.001-0.015). ConclusionsEmotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMental illnesses are a leading cause of disability globally. Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children.

MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level.

ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children.

DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD.

Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment.

Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form.

ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce.

ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPuberty depicts a period of profound and multifactorial changes ranging from social to biological factors. While brain development in youths has been studied mostly from an age perspective, recent evidence suggests that pubertal measures may be more sensitive to study adolescent neurodevelopment, however, studies on pubertal timing in relation to brain development are still scarce.

MethodsWe investigated if pre- vs. post-menarche status can be classified using machine learning on cortical and subcortical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from strictly age-matched adolescent females from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. For comparison of the identified menarche-related patterns to age-related patterns of neurodevelopment, we trained a brain age prediction model on data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and applied it to the same ABCD data, yielding differences between predicted and chronological age referred to as brain age gaps. We tested the sensitivity of both these frameworks to measures of pubertal maturation, specifically age at menarche and puberty status.

ResultsThe machine learning model achieved moderate but statistically significant accuracy in the menarche classification task, yielding for each subject a class probability ranging from 0 (pre-) to 1 (post-menarche). Comparison to brain age predictions revealed shared and distinct patterns of neurodevelopment captured by both approaches. Continuous menarche class probabilities were positively associated with brain age gaps, but only the menarche class probabilities - not the brain age gaps - were associated with age at menarche.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the use of a machine learning model to classify menarche status from structural MRI data while accounting for age-related neurodevelopment. Given its sensitivity towards measures of puberty timing, our work suggests that menarche class probabilities may be developed toward an objective brain-based marker of pubertal development.

Highlights{checkmark} We classified pre- vs. post-menarche status in adolescent females from structural brain imaging data
{checkmark}We compared class probabilities to brain-age predictions to disentangle puberty- vs. age-related patterns of brain development
{checkmark}The derived continuous brain-based menarche class probabilities captured shared but also unique variations of adolescent neurodevelopment, and were associated with pubertal timing and status


Plain English SummaryPuberty is a period of substantial changes in the life of youths, and these include profound brain changes. Most studies have investigated age related changes in brain development, recent work however suggests that looking at brain development through the lens of pubertal development can provide additional insights beyond age effects. We here analyzed brain imaging data from a group of same-aged adolescent girls from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. Our goal was to investigate if we could determine from brain images whether a girl had started her menstrual period (menarche) or not, and we used machine learning to classify between them. This machine learning model does not just return a &#34;yes/no&#34; decision, but also returns a number between 0 and 1 indicating a probability to be pre- (0) or post- (1) menarche. To rule out, that our approach only maps age-related development, we selected a strictly age-matched sample of girls and compared our classification model to a brain age model trained on independent individuals. Our model classified between pre- and post-menarche with moderate accuracy. The obtained class probability was partly related to age-related brain development, but only the probability was significantly associated with pubertal timing (age at menarche). In summary, our study uses a machine learning model to estimate whether a girl has reached menarche based on her brain structure. This approach offers new insights into the connection between puberty and brain development and might serve as an objective way to assess pubertal timing from imaging data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDepression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort.

MethodsWe included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume.

ResultsAcross all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations.

ConclusionLifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 3.9%-5.6% of the worldwide population, with well-documented sex-related differences. While psychosocial and hormonal factors affecting sex differences in PTSD and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom etiology have been explored, there has been limited focus on genetic bases of these differences. Many symptom combinations may confer a PTSD diagnosis. We hypothesized that these symptom combinations have sex-specific patterns, the examination of which could inform etiological differences in PTSD genetics between males and females. To investigate this, we performed a sex-stratified multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) in unrelated UK Biobank (UKB) individuals of European ancestry. Using GWAS summary association data, genomic structural equation modeling was performed to generate sex-specific factor models using six indicator variables: trouble concentrating, feeling distant from others, irritability, disturbing thoughts, upset feelings, and avoidance of places/activities which remind the individual of a traumatic event. Models of male and female PTSD symptoms differed substantially (local standardized root mean square difference=3.12) and significantly ({chi}2(5)=28.03, p=3.6x10-5). Independent two-factor models best fit the data in both males and females; these factors were subjected to GWAS in each sex, revealing three genome-wide significant loci in females, mapping to SCAND3, WDPCP, and FAM120A. No genome-wide significant loci were identified in males. All four PTS factors (2 in males and 2 in females) were heritable (p&lt;0.05): male PTS-f1 h2-SNP=1.85%, male PTS-f2 h2-SNP=1.47%, female PTS-f1 h2-SNP=3.87%, female PTS-f2 h2-SNP=3.53%. Male PTS-f1 was enriched for medication-related putative causal relationships (3.73-fold, p=0.032) while male PTS-f2 was enriched for body structure (2.84-fold, p=5.512x10-7) and cognitive (3.22-fold, p=0.009) putative causal relationships. In females, PTS-f1 was enriched for metabolic putative causal relationships (28.08-fold, p=0.035). By assessing the relationship between sex and PTSD symptoms, this study informs correlative and putatively causal etiological differences between males and females which support further investigation of sex differences in PTSD genetics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex.

MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1&#43; PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2&#43; PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression.

ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients.

ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDifferences in affective processing have previously been shown in functional neurological disorder (FND); however, the mechanistic relevance is uncertain. We tested the hypotheses that highly arousing affective stimulation would result in elevated subjective functional neurological symptoms (FNS), and this would be associated with elevated autonomic reactivity. The possible influence of cognitive detachment was also explored.

MethodsIndividuals diagnosed with FND (motor symptoms/seizures; n=14) and healthy controls (HCs; n=14) viewed Positive, Negative, and Neutral images in blocks, whilst passively observing the stimuli (&#34;Watch&#34;) or detaching themselves (&#34;Distance&#34;). The FND group rated their primary FNS, and all participants rated subjective physical (arousal, pain, fatigue) and psychological states (positive/negative affect, dissociation), immediately after each block. Skin conductance (SC) and heartrate (HR) were monitored continuously.

ResultsFNS ratings were higher after Negative compared to Positive and Neutral blocks in the FND group (p=0.002, {eta}p2=0.386); however, this effect was diminished in the Distance condition relative to the Watch condition (p=0.018, {eta}p2=0.267). SC and/or HR correlated with FNS ratings in the Negative-Watch and Neutral-Distance conditions (r-values: 0.527-0.672, p-values: 0.035-0.006). The groups did not differ in subjective affect or perceived arousal (p-values: 0.541-0.919, {eta}p2: &lt;0.001-0.015).

ConclusionsEmotionally significant events may exert an influence on FNS which is related to autonomic activation rather than altered subjective affect or perceived arousal. This influence may be modulated by cognitive detachment. Further work is needed to determine the relevance and neural bases of these processes in specific FND phenotypes.</p>
