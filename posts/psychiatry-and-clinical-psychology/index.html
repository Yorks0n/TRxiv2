Limited high-quality evidence exists for the potential impact of prison environmental factors such as solitary confinement. This pilot prospective cohort study in a large male remand prison in England sought to estimate effect sizes of a comprehensive range of prison environmental factors on self-harming behaviours. MethodsA random sample of all prisoners (N=149) starting a period of imprisonment at the study prison took part in a clinical research interview, which assessed a range of known risk factors for self-harm in prison. Information concerning environmental factors, including staff numbers, cell placement and movements, and engagement in work and activities were collected from prison records. Incidents of self-harm behaviour in the 3 months after entering prison were measured using medical records and self-report at end of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated individually for each predictor. ResultsSingle cell placement (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.06-18.24, p=0.041) and more frequent cellmate (OR 1.52, CI 1.14-2.17, p=0.009) and cell (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.86, p=0.003) changes were associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Unexpectedly, a lower staff-to-prisoner ratio (OR 0.89, CI 0.78-0.99, p=0.039) was also associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Following sensitivity analyses, the associations between frequent cell changes and self-harm behaviour, and between single cell placement and self-harm ideation, remained statistically significant. DiscussionThis pilot study provides prospective longitudinal data regarding relationships between prison environmental factors and self-harm behaviour. Findings regarding single cell accommodation and frequent cell changes are consistent with the prior evidence base largely derived from case-control study data. The finding regarding frequent cellmate changes predicting self-harm is novel. Findings regarding staff-prisoner ratio and self-harm most likely reflect a reverse causal relationship. Replication in larger cohort studies is required to address the limitations of this pilot study.\nDistinguishing different psychiatric disorders using DDx-PRS\nAuthors: Peyrot, W. J.; Panagiotaropoulou, G.; Olde Loohuis, L. M.; Adams, M.; Awasthi, S.; Ge, T.; McIntosh, A. M.; Mitchell, B. L.; Mullins, N.; O'Connell, K. S.; Penninx, B. W. J. H.; Posthuma, D.; Ripke, S.; Ruderfer, D. M.; Uffelmann, E.; Vilhjalmsson, B. J.; Zhu, Z.; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, ; Bipolar Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, ; Major Depressive Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, ; Smoller, J. W.; Price, A. L.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.24302228\nDespite great progress on methods for case-control polygenic prediction (e.g. schizophrenia vs. control), there remains an unmet need for a method that genetically distinguishes clinically related disorders (e.g. schizophrenia (SCZ) vs. bipolar disorder (BIP) vs. depression (MDD) vs. control); such a method could have important clinical value, especially at disorder onset when differential diagnosis can be challenging. Here, we introduce a method, Differential Diagnosis-Polygenic Risk Score (DDx-PRS), that jointly estimates posterior probabilities of each possible diagnostic category (e.g. SCZ=50%, BIP=25%, MDD=15%, control=10%) by modeling variance/covariance structure across disorders, leveraging case-control polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each disorder (computed using existing methods) and prior clinical probabilities for each diagnostic category. DDx-PRS uses only summary-level training data and does not use tuning data, facilitating implementation in clinical settings. In simulations, DDx-PRS was well-calibrated (whereas a simpler approach that analyzes each disorder marginally was poorly calibrated), and effective in distinguishing each diagnostic category vs. the rest. We then applied DDx-PRS to Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ/BIP/MDD/control data, including summary-level training data from 3 case-control GWAS (N=41,917-173,140 cases; total N=1,048,683) and held-out test data from different cohorts with equal numbers of each diagnostic category (total N=11,460). DDx-PRS was well-calibrated and well-powered relative to these training sample sizes, attaining AUCs of 0.66 for SCZ vs. rest, 0.64 for BIP vs. rest, 0.59 for MDD vs. rest, and 0.68 for control vs. rest. DDx-PRS produced comparable results to methods that leverage tuning data, confirming that DDx-PRS is an effective method. True diagnosis probabilities in top deciles of predicted diagnosis probabilities were considerably larger than prior baseline probabilities, particularly in projections to larger training sample sizes, implying considerable potential for clinical utility under certain circumstances. In conclusion, DDx-PRS is an effective method for distinguishing clinically related disorders.\nDevelopment, validation, and clinical utility of Short-term AdVerse-effects of Electroconvulsive therapy (SAVE) Checklist\nAuthors: Uppinkudru, C.; Pathak, H.; K, R. K.; S, B.; Bagali, K.; Pantoji, M.; Ezhumalai, N.; Parlikar, R.; Shah, V.; Balachander, S.; Sreeraj, V. S.; Mehta, U. M.; Sinha, P.; Arumugham, S. S.; Venkatasubramanian, G.; Thirthalli, J.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301691\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry. However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.\nStructural brain abnormalities and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia: Mega-analysis of data from 2095 patients and 2861 healthy controls via the ENIGMA consortium\nAuthors: Lamsma, J.; Raine, A.; Kia, S.

H.; Iasevoli, F.; Kaiser, S.; Kaleda, V.; Karuk, A.; Kim, M.; Kircher, T.; Kirschner, M.; Kochunov, P.; Kwon, J. S.; Lebedeva, I\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.24302268\nBackground Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of aggressive behaviour, which may partly be explained by illness-related changes in brain structure. However, previous studies have been limited by group-level analyses, small and selective samples of inpatients and long time lags between exposure and outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study pooled data from 20 sites participating in the international ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. Sites acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in a total of 2095 patients with schizophrenia and 2861 healthy controls. Measures of grey matter volume and white matter microstructural integrity were extracted from the scans using harmonised protocols. For each measure, normative modelling was used to calculate how much patients deviated (in z-scores) from healthy controls at the individual level. Ordinal regression models were used to estimate the associations of these deviations with concurrent aggressive behaviour (as odds ratios [ORs] with 99% confidence intervals [CIs]). Mediation analyses were performed for positive symptoms (i.e., delusions, hallucinations and disorganised thinking), impulse control and illness insight. Aggression and potential mediators were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Results Aggressive behaviour was significantly associated with reductions in total cortical volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.88 [0.78, 0.98], p = .003) and global white matter integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.72 [0.59, 0.88], p = 3.50 x 10-5) and additional reductions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.85 [0.74, 0.97], p =.002), inferior parietal lobule volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.66, 0.87], p = 2.20 x 10-7) and internal capsule integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92], p = 2.90 x 10-4). Except for inferior parietal lobule volume, these associations were largely mediated by increased severity of positive symptoms and reduced impulse control. Conclusions This study provides evidence that the co-occurrence of positive symptoms, poor impulse control and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia has a neurobiological basis, which may inform the development of therapeutic interventions.\nWhite Matter Microstructure Alterations and Their Link to Symptomatology in Early Psychosis and Schizophrenia\nAuthors: Pavan, T.; Aleman-Gomez, Y.; Jenni, R.; Steullet, P.; Schilliger, Z.; Dwir, D.; Cleusix, M.; Alameda, L.; Do, K. Q.; Conus, P.; Klauser, P.; Hagmann, P.; Jelescu, I.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.24301979\nBackground and HypothesisStudies on schizophrenia feature diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate white matter (WM) anomalies. The heterogeneity in the possible interpretations of these metrics highlights the importance of increasing their specificity. Here, we characterize WM pathology in early psychosis (EP) and schizophrenia (SZ) with increased specificity using advanced dMRI metrics: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and White Matter Track Integrity - Watson (WMTI-W) biophysical model. This enables us to better characterize WM abnormalities and relate them to the patients symptomatology. Study DesigndMRI-derived microstructure features were extracted from all of WM and from individual tracts in 275 individuals. 93 patients with EP and 47 with SZ were compared respectively to 135 age-range matched healthy controls (HC). The relationships between the dMRI metrics in WM and various clinical scales were investigated in each patient group. Study ResultsWM diffusivities were higher, while kurtosis was lower in EP and SZ vs HC. Differences were more pronounced in EP than SZ. WMTI-W model parameters suggest alterations to the extra-axonal compartment in EP and SZ, consistent with abnormal myelin integrity and WM deterioration. Patient groups showed clustered but non-significant correlations between dMRI metrics and psychotic symptoms. Depressive dimensions were significantly associated with decreased diffusivities in WM, while manic scales correlated with increased diffusivities and reduced kurtosis. ConclusionsdMRI patterns in EP and SZ highly suggest WM deterioration in comparison to HC. DMRI changes better align with affective dimensions, while the relationship with psychotic symptoms may be confounded by competing pathological effects on the microstructure and disease heterogeneity.\nMachine Learning Models Predict the Emergence of Depression in Argentinean College Students during Periods of COVID-19 Quarantine\nAuthors: Lopez Steinmetz, L. C.; Sison, M.; Zhumagambetov, R.; Godoy, J. C.; Haufe, S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301772\nINTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction. METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors. RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features. DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.\nEsketamine-induced post-traumatic stress disorder flashbacks during treatment-resistant depression indication: is it just a side effect?\nAuthors: Rotharmel, M.; Mekaoui, L.; Kazour, F.; Herrero, M.; Beetz-Lobono, E.-M.; Lengvenyte, A.; Holtzmann, J.; Raynaud, P.; Cuenca, M.; Bulteau, S.; de Maricourt, P.; Husson, T.; Olie, E.; Gohier, B.; Sauvaget, A.; Gaillard, R.; Richieri, R.; Szekely, D.; Samalin, L.; Guillin, O.; Moulier, V.; El-Hage, W.; Laurin, A.; Berkovitch, L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24300998\nBackgroundPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and frequent affection that is highly comorbid to major depressive disorder. Comorbid PTSD and depression are usually treatment-resistant, with a high risk of functional impairment and suicide. Esketamine nasal spray is a recent validated treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but its efficacy on comorbid TRD-PTSD remains insufficiently documented. In particular, flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration and their influence on clinical outcomes is unknown. ObjectivesOur main objective was to describe esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks and their impact on clinical trajectories within a sample of patients with comorbid TRD-PTSD. MethodsWe retrospectively collected clinical data of patients receiving esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD who experienced at least one flashback of their trauma during esketamine sessions across 11 psychiatric departments. ResultsBetween February 2020 and March 2023, 22 adult patients with TRD met inclusion criteria. In sixteen patients (72.7%) flashbacks disappeared as the sessions progressed. In six patients (27.3%), esketamine treatment was stopped because of persistent flashbacks. When esketamine was continued, clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD (depression response rate: 45.5% and remission rate: 22.7%; PTSD response rate: 45.5% and remission: 18.2%). LimitationsThe retrospective design of the study and the absence of a comparator group are the main limitations of our study. ConclusionsOur results suggest that the occurrence of esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder clinical response. On the contrary, when managed appropriately and combined with targeted psychotherapy, it could even contribute to positive outcomes. HighlightsO_LIEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression C_LIO_LIIts efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder is poorly documented. C_LIO_LITraumatic flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration. C_LIO_LIEsketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder its clinical response. C_LI Clinical impact statementEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Its efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is poorly documented. In this study, we reported the data of 22 adult patients who received esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD and experienced flashbacks during esketamine sessions. These flashbacks did not appear to be a contreindication to the administration of esketamine and clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD. Our results suggest that esketamine could be safely administered to patients with comorbid PTSD and TRD and that esketamine could lead to a substantial improvement in this population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionSelf-harm is a major public health issue in the imprisoned population. Limited high-quality evidence exists for the potential impact of prison environmental factors such as solitary confinement. This pilot prospective cohort study in a large male remand prison in England sought to estimate effect sizes of a comprehensive range of prison environmental factors on self-harming behaviours.

MethodsA random sample of all prisoners (N=149) starting a period of imprisonment at the study prison took part in a clinical research interview, which assessed a range of known risk factors for self-harm in prison. Information concerning environmental factors, including staff numbers, cell placement and movements, and engagement in work and activities were collected from prison records. Incidents of self-harm behaviour in the 3 months after entering prison were measured using medical records and self-report at end of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated individually for each predictor.

ResultsSingle cell placement (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.06-18.24, p=0.041) and more frequent cellmate (OR 1.52, CI 1.14-2.17, p=0.009) and cell (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.28-2.86, p=0.003) changes were associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Unexpectedly, a lower staff-to-prisoner ratio (OR 0.89, CI 0.78-0.99, p=0.039) was also associated with an increased risk of self-harming behaviour. Following sensitivity analyses, the associations between frequent cell changes and self-harm behaviour, and between single cell placement and self-harm ideation, remained statistically significant.

DiscussionThis pilot study provides prospective longitudinal data regarding relationships between prison environmental factors and self-harm behaviour. Findings regarding single cell accommodation and frequent cell changes are consistent with the prior evidence base largely derived from case-control study data. The finding regarding frequent cellmate changes predicting self-harm is novel. Findings regarding staff-prisoner ratio and self-harm most likely reflect a reverse causal relationship. Replication in larger cohort studies is required to address the limitations of this pilot study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite great progress on methods for case-control polygenic prediction (e.g. schizophrenia vs. control), there remains an unmet need for a method that genetically distinguishes clinically related disorders (e.g. schizophrenia (SCZ) vs. bipolar disorder (BIP) vs. depression (MDD) vs. control); such a method could have important clinical value, especially at disorder onset when differential diagnosis can be challenging. Here, we introduce a method, Differential Diagnosis-Polygenic Risk Score (DDx-PRS), that jointly estimates posterior probabilities of each possible diagnostic category (e.g. SCZ=50%, BIP=25%, MDD=15%, control=10%) by modeling variance/covariance structure across disorders, leveraging case-control polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each disorder (computed using existing methods) and prior clinical probabilities for each diagnostic category. DDx-PRS uses only summary-level training data and does not use tuning data, facilitating implementation in clinical settings. In simulations, DDx-PRS was well-calibrated (whereas a simpler approach that analyzes each disorder marginally was poorly calibrated), and effective in distinguishing each diagnostic category vs. the rest. We then applied DDx-PRS to Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ/BIP/MDD/control data, including summary-level training data from 3 case-control GWAS (N=41,917-173,140 cases; total N=1,048,683) and held-out test data from different cohorts with equal numbers of each diagnostic category (total N=11,460). DDx-PRS was well-calibrated and well-powered relative to these training sample sizes, attaining AUCs of 0.66 for SCZ vs. rest, 0.64 for BIP vs. rest, 0.59 for MDD vs. rest, and 0.68 for control vs. rest. DDx-PRS produced comparable results to methods that leverage tuning data, confirming that DDx-PRS is an effective method. True diagnosis probabilities in top deciles of predicted diagnosis probabilities were considerably larger than prior baseline probabilities, particularly in projections to larger training sample sizes, implying considerable potential for clinical utility under certain circumstances. In conclusion, DDx-PRS is an effective method for distinguishing clinically related disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry. However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of aggressive behaviour, which may partly be explained by illness-related changes in brain structure. However, previous studies have been limited by group-level analyses, small and selective samples of inpatients and long time lags between exposure and outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study pooled data from 20 sites participating in the international ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group. Sites acquired T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans in a total of 2095 patients with schizophrenia and 2861 healthy controls. Measures of grey matter volume and white matter microstructural integrity were extracted from the scans using harmonised protocols. For each measure, normative modelling was used to calculate how much patients deviated (in z-scores) from healthy controls at the individual level. Ordinal regression models were used to estimate the associations of these deviations with concurrent aggressive behaviour (as odds ratios [ORs] with 99% confidence intervals [CIs]). Mediation analyses were performed for positive symptoms (i.e., delusions, hallucinations and disorganised thinking), impulse control and illness insight. Aggression and potential mediators were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Results Aggressive behaviour was significantly associated with reductions in total cortical volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.88 [0.78, 0.98], p = .003) and global white matter integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.72 [0.59, 0.88], p = 3.50 x 10-5) and additional reductions in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.85 [0.74, 0.97], p =.002), inferior parietal lobule volume (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.66, 0.87], p = 2.20 x 10-7) and internal capsule integrity (OR [99% CI] = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92], p = 2.90 x 10-4). Except for inferior parietal lobule volume, these associations were largely mediated by increased severity of positive symptoms and reduced impulse control. Conclusions This study provides evidence that the co-occurrence of positive symptoms, poor impulse control and aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia has a neurobiological basis, which may inform the development of therapeutic interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and HypothesisStudies on schizophrenia feature diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate white matter (WM) anomalies. The heterogeneity in the possible interpretations of these metrics highlights the importance of increasing their specificity. Here, we characterize WM pathology in early psychosis (EP) and schizophrenia (SZ) with increased specificity using advanced dMRI metrics: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging and White Matter Track Integrity - Watson (WMTI-W) biophysical model. This enables us to better characterize WM abnormalities and relate them to the patients symptomatology.

Study DesigndMRI-derived microstructure features were extracted from all of WM and from individual tracts in 275 individuals. 93 patients with EP and 47 with SZ were compared respectively to 135 age-range matched healthy controls (HC). The relationships between the dMRI metrics in WM and various clinical scales were investigated in each patient group.

Study ResultsWM diffusivities were higher, while kurtosis was lower in EP and SZ vs HC. Differences were more pronounced in EP than SZ. WMTI-W model parameters suggest alterations to the extra-axonal compartment in EP and SZ, consistent with abnormal myelin integrity and WM deterioration. Patient groups showed clustered but non-significant correlations between dMRI metrics and psychotic symptoms. Depressive dimensions were significantly associated with decreased diffusivities in WM, while manic scales correlated with increased diffusivities and reduced kurtosis.

ConclusionsdMRI patterns in EP and SZ highly suggest WM deterioration in comparison to HC. DMRI changes better align with affective dimensions, while the relationship with psychotic symptoms may be confounded by competing pathological effects on the microstructure and disease heterogeneity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction.

METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors.

RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features.

DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and frequent affection that is highly comorbid to major depressive disorder. Comorbid PTSD and depression are usually treatment-resistant, with a high risk of functional impairment and suicide. Esketamine nasal spray is a recent validated treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but its efficacy on comorbid TRD-PTSD remains insufficiently documented. In particular, flashbacks can occur during esketamine administration and their influence on clinical outcomes is unknown.

ObjectivesOur main objective was to describe esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks and their impact on clinical trajectories within a sample of patients with comorbid TRD-PTSD.

MethodsWe retrospectively collected clinical data of patients receiving esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD who experienced at least one flashback of their trauma during esketamine sessions across 11 psychiatric departments.

ResultsBetween February 2020 and March 2023, 22 adult patients with TRD met inclusion criteria. In sixteen patients (72.7%) flashbacks disappeared as the sessions progressed. In six patients (27.3%), esketamine treatment was stopped because of persistent flashbacks. When esketamine was continued, clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD (depression response rate: 45.5% and remission rate: 22.7%; PTSD response rate: 45.5% and remission: 18.2%).

LimitationsThe retrospective design of the study and the absence of a comparator group are the main limitations of our study.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that the occurrence of esketamine-induced traumatic flashbacks does not hinder clinical response. On the contrary, when managed appropriately and combined with targeted psychotherapy, it could even contribute to positive outcomes.

Clinical impact statementEsketamine nasal spray is recently validated for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Its efficacy on comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is poorly documented. In this study, we reported the data of 22 adult patients who received esketamine nasal spray for TRD with comorbid PTSD and experienced flashbacks during esketamine sessions. These flashbacks did not appear to be a contreindication to the administration of esketamine and clinical response was observed both for depression and PTSD. Our results suggest that esketamine could be safely administered to patients with comorbid PTSD and TRD and that esketamine could lead to a substantial improvement in this population.</p>
