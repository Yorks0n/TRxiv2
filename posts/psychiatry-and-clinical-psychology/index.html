D.; Westwater, M. L.; Williams, C. M.; Fortgang, R. G.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Elson, S. L.; Fontanillas, P.; Davis, L. K.; Raznahan, A.; Tucker-Drob, E. M.; Choi, K. W.; Ge, T.; Smoller, J.

A.; Sanchez-Roige, S.\nScore: 17.3, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.23299133\nImpulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.\nNon-random Mating Patterns in Education, Mental, and Somatic Health: A Population Study on Within- and Cross-Trait Associations\nAuthors: Torvik, F. A.; Sunde, H. F.; Cheesman, R.; Eftedal, N. H.; Keller, M. C.; Ystrom, E.; Eilertsen, E. M.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299055\nPartners resemble each other on many traits, such as health and education. The traits are usually studied one by one in data from established couples and with potential participation bias. We studied all Norwegian parents who had their first child between 2016 and 2020 (N=187,926) and the siblings of these parents. We analysed grade point averages (GPA), educational attainment (EA), and medical records with prospective diagnostic data on 10 mental and 10 somatic health conditions measured 10 to 5 years before childbirth. We found stronger partner similarity in mental (median r=0.14) than in somatic health conditions (median r=0.04), with ubiquitous cross-trait correlations for mental health conditions (median r=0.13). GPA correlated 0.43 and EA 0.47 between partners. High GPA or EA was associated with better mental (median r=-0.16) and somatic (median r=-0.08) health in partners. Elevated correlations for mental health (median r=0.25) in established couples indicated convergence. Analyses of data on siblings and in-laws revealed deviations from direct assortment, suggesting instead indirect assortment based on related traits. GPA and EA accounted for 30-40% of the partner correlations in health. This has implications for the distribution of risk factors among children and for studies of intergenerational transmission.\nConvergent functional effects of antidepressants in major depressive disorder: a neuroimaging meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saberi, A.; Ebneabbasi, A.; Rahimi, S.; Sarebannejad, S.; Sen, Z. D.; Graf, H.; Walter, M.; Sorg, C.; Camilleri, J. A.; Laird, A. R.; Fox, P. T.; Valk, S. L.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298991\nBackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems. MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps. ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters. ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.\nComputational phenotyping of aberrant belief updating in individuals with schizotypal traits and schizophrenia\nAuthors: Mikus, N.; Lamm, C.; Mathys, C. D.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299069\nPsychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = - 0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.\nApproaches to improve mental health care for autistic children and young people: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Pemovska, T.; Loizou, S.; Appleton, R.; Spain, D.; Stefanidou, T.; Kular, A.; Cooper, R.; Greenburgh, A.; Griffiths, J.; Barnett, P.; Foye, U.; Baldwin, H.; Minchin, M.; Brady, G.; Saunders, K.; Ahmed, N.; Jackson, R.; Olive, R. R.; Parker, J.; Timmerman, A.; Sapiets, S.; Driskell, E.; Chipp, B.; Parsons, B.; Totsika, V.; Mandy, W.; Pender, R.; Clery, P.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Simpson, A.; Johnson, S.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.23299246\nAutistic children and young people (CYP) experience mental health difficulties but face many barriers to accessing and benefiting from mental health care. There is a need to explore strategies in mental health care for autistic CYP to guide clinical practice and future research and support their mental health needs. Our aim was to identify strategies used to improve mental health care for autistic CYP and examine evidence on their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. All study designs reporting acceptability/feasibility outcomes and empirical quantitative studies reporting effectiveness outcomes for strategies tested within mental health care were eligible. We conducted a narrative synthesis and separate meta-analyses by informant (self, parent, clinician). Fifty-seven papers were included, with most investigating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anxiety and several exploring service-level strategies, such as autism screening tools, clinician training, adaptations regarding organisation of services. Most papers described caregiver involvement in therapy and reported adaptations to communication and intervention content; a few reported environmental adjustments. In the meta-analyses, parent- and clinician-reported outcomes, but not self-reported outcomes, showed with moderate certainty that CBT for anxiety was an effective treatment compared to any comparison condition in reducing anxiety symptoms in autistic individuals. The certainty of evidence for effectiveness, synthesised narratively, ranged from low to moderate. Evidence for feasibility and acceptability tended to be positive. Many identified strategies are simple, reasonable adjustments that can be implemented in services to enhance mental health care for autistic individuals. Notable research gaps persist, however.\nSociodemographic and clinical risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in functional/dissociative seizures and epilepsy: a large cohort study\nAuthors: Faiman, I.; Hodsoll, J.; Jasani, I.; Young, A. H.; Shotbolt, P.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298811\nObjectiveTo identify risk factors for first episodes of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) or epilepsy. MethodsRetrospective cohort study from the UKs largest tertiary mental health care provider, with linked national admission data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Participants were 2383 people with a primary or secondary diagnosis of FDS or epilepsy attending between 01/01/2007 and 18/06/2021. Outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and a first hospital admission for suicide attempt (ICD-10 X60-X84). Demographic and clinical risk factors were assessed using multivariable bias-reduced binomial-response generalised linear models. ResultsIn both groups, ethnic minorities had significantly reduced odds of hospitalisations following a suicide attempt (OR: 0.45 - 0.49). Disorder-specific risk factors were gender, age, and comorbidity profile. In FDS, both genders had similar risk of suicidality; younger age was a risk factor for both outcomes (OR: 0.16 - 1.91) and a diagnosis of Depression or Personality Disorders was associated with higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation (OR: 1.91 and 3.01 respectively). In epilepsy, females had higher odds of being hospitalised following suicide attempt (OR: 1.64). Age had a quadratic association with both outcomes (OR: 0.88 - 1.06). A Substance Abuse Disorder was associated to higher suicidal ideation (OR: 2.67) whilst Developmental Disorders lowered the risk (OR: 0.16 - 0.24). ConclusionsThis is the first study systematically reporting risk factors for suicidality in people with FDS. Results for the large epilepsy cohort complement previous studies and will be useful in future meta-analyses. KEY MESSAGE BOXWhat is already known on this topic O_LIPeople with epilepsy and people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) are at elevated risk of suicide C_LI Identification of risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in high-risk groups is essential to inform risk prevention strategies What this study adds O_LISeveral factors are associated with suicidality in FDS, including age, ethnicity, comorbid Depression and Personality Disorders. C_LIO_LIIn epilepsy, suicidality is associated with age, gender, ethnicity, comorbid Substance Misuse Disorder and Developmental Disorders. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policy O_LIWhilst disorder-specific factors will be useful to identify groups at higher risk in clinical settings, general risk factors can be target of population-based preventive strategies.

M.; Nitsche, M. A.; Salehinejad, M. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.23299285\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with a high disease burden, and treatment options are limited. We used intensified electrical stimulation in two dosages to target a main circuitry associated with the pathophysiology of OCD, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and assessed clinical outcomes, neuropsychological performance and brain physiology. In a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial, thirty-nine patients with OCD were randomized to sham, 2-mA or 1-mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the l-DLPFC (F3) and SMA (FC2) with anodal and cathodal stimulation respectively. The treatment included 10 sessions of 20-minute stimulation delivered twice per day with 20-min between-session intervals. Outcome measures were reduction in OCD symptoms, anxiety and depressive states, performance on a neuropsychological test battery of response inhibition, working memory, attention, and oscillatory brain activities and functional connectivity. All outcome measures except EEG were examined at pre-intervention, post-intervention and 1-month follow-up times. The 2-mA protocol significantly reduced OCD symptoms, anxiety, depression states, and improved quality of life after the intervention up to 1-month follow-up compared to the sham group, while the 1-mA protocol reduced OCD symptoms only in the follow-up and depressive state immediately after and 1-month following the intervention. Both protocols partially improved response inhibition, and the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to OCD-related stimuli and improved reaction time in working memory performance. Both protocols increased alpha oscillatory power and the 2-mA intensified protocol decreased delta power as well. Both protocols increased connectivity in higher frequency bands at frontal-central areas compared to the sham. Modulation of the prefrontal-supplementary motor network with intensified tDCS ameliorates OCD clinical symptoms and results in beneficial cognitive effects. The 2-mA intensified stimulation resulted in larger symptom reduction and improved more converging outcome variables related to therapeutic efficacy. These results support applying the intensified prefrontal-SMA tDCS in larger trials.\nCognitive and inflammatory heterogeneity in severe mental illness: Translating findings from blood to brain\nAuthors: Saether, L. S.; Szabo, A.; Akkouh, I. A.; Haatveit, B.; Mohn, C.; Vaskinn, A.; Aukrust, P.; Ormerod, M. B. E. G.; Steen, N. E.; Melle, I.; Djurovic, S.; Andreassen, O. A.; Ueland, T.; Ueland, T.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297924\nRecent findings link cognitive impairment and inflammatory-immune dysregulation in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BD) spectrum disorders. However, heterogeneity and translation between the periphery and central (blood-to-brain) mechanisms remains a challenge. Starting with a large SZ, BD and healthy control cohort (n=1235), we aimed to i) identify candidate peripheral markers (n=25) associated with cognitive domains (n=9) and elucidate heterogenous immune-cognitive patterns, ii) evaluate the regulation of candidate markers using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells (n=10), and iii) evaluate candidate marker messenger RNA expression in leukocytes using microarray in available data from a subsample of the main cohort (n=776), and in available RNA-sequencing deconvolution analysis of postmortem brain samples (n=474) from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC). We identified transdiagnostic subgroups based on covariance between cognitive domains (measures of speed and verbal learning) and peripheral markers reflecting inflammatory response (CRP, sTNFR1, YKL-40), innate immune activation (MIF) and extracellular matrix remodelling (YKL-40, CatS). Of the candidate markers there was considerable variance in secretion of YKL-40 in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells in SZ compared to HC. Further, we provide evidence of dysregulated RNA expression of genes encoding YKL-40 and related signalling pathways in a high inflammatory subgroup consisting predominantly of SZ in the postmortem brain samples. Our findings suggest a relationship between peripheral inflammatory-immune activity and cognitive impairment, and highlight YKL-40 as a potential marker of cognitive functioning in a subgroup of individuals with severe mental illness.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Impulsivity is a complex psychological construct that represents a core feature of many psychiatric and neurological conditions. Here, we used multivariate methods to formally model the genetic architecture of impulsivity in humans, advancing genomic discovery and revealing pervasive pleiotropy that largely counters theories of impulsivity as a unitary construct. We identified 18 loci and 93 genes with diverse effects in GWAS and TWAS analyses, respectively, including a hotspot at 17q21.31 that harbors genes involved in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Downstream analyses revealed that heterogeneous signals were localized to specific biological correlates, including expression in brain tissue during fetal development and cortical alterations in the inferior frontal gyrus. Polygenic score analyses suggested that liability for different forms of impulsivity may differentiate across development, operating via broad pathways early in life but affecting diverse outcomes by adulthood. Collectively, our study generates new insights into the pleiotropic architecture of impulsivity, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of its multi-faceted biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Partners resemble each other on many traits, such as health and education. The traits are usually studied one by one in data from established couples and with potential participation bias. We studied all Norwegian parents who had their first child between 2016 and 2020 (N=187,926) and the siblings of these parents. We analysed grade point averages (GPA), educational attainment (EA), and medical records with prospective diagnostic data on 10 mental and 10 somatic health conditions measured 10 to 5 years before childbirth. We found stronger partner similarity in mental (median r=0.14) than in somatic health conditions (median r=0.04), with ubiquitous cross-trait correlations for mental health conditions (median r=0.13). GPA correlated 0.43 and EA 0.47 between partners. High GPA or EA was associated with better mental (median r=-0.16) and somatic (median r=-0.08) health in partners. Elevated correlations for mental health (median r=0.25) in established couples indicated convergence. Analyses of data on siblings and in-laws revealed deviations from direct assortment, suggesting instead indirect assortment based on related traits. GPA and EA accounted for 30-40% of the partner correlations in health. This has implications for the distribution of risk factors among children and for studies of intergenerational transmission.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems.

MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps.

ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters.

ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = - 0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autistic children and young people (CYP) experience mental health difficulties but face many barriers to accessing and benefiting from mental health care. There is a need to explore strategies in mental health care for autistic CYP to guide clinical practice and future research and support their mental health needs. Our aim was to identify strategies used to improve mental health care for autistic CYP and examine evidence on their acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. All study designs reporting acceptability/feasibility outcomes and empirical quantitative studies reporting effectiveness outcomes for strategies tested within mental health care were eligible. We conducted a narrative synthesis and separate meta-analyses by informant (self, parent, clinician). Fifty-seven papers were included, with most investigating cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions for anxiety and several exploring service-level strategies, such as autism screening tools, clinician training, adaptations regarding organisation of services. Most papers described caregiver involvement in therapy and reported adaptations to communication and intervention content; a few reported environmental adjustments. In the meta-analyses, parent- and clinician-reported outcomes, but not self-reported outcomes, showed with moderate certainty that CBT for anxiety was an effective treatment compared to any comparison condition in reducing anxiety symptoms in autistic individuals. The certainty of evidence for effectiveness, synthesised narratively, ranged from low to moderate. Evidence for feasibility and acceptability tended to be positive. Many identified strategies are simple, reasonable adjustments that can be implemented in services to enhance mental health care for autistic individuals. Notable research gaps persist, however.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo identify risk factors for first episodes of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) or epilepsy.

MethodsRetrospective cohort study from the UKs largest tertiary mental health care provider, with linked national admission data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Participants were 2383 people with a primary or secondary diagnosis of FDS or epilepsy attending between 01/01/2007 and 18/06/2021. Outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and a first hospital admission for suicide attempt (ICD-10 X60-X84). Demographic and clinical risk factors were assessed using multivariable bias-reduced binomial-response generalised linear models.

ResultsIn both groups, ethnic minorities had significantly reduced odds of hospitalisations following a suicide attempt (OR: 0.45 - 0.49). Disorder-specific risk factors were gender, age, and comorbidity profile. In FDS, both genders had similar risk of suicidality; younger age was a risk factor for both outcomes (OR: 0.16 - 1.91) and a diagnosis of Depression or Personality Disorders was associated with higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation (OR: 1.91 and 3.01 respectively). In epilepsy, females had higher odds of being hospitalised following suicide attempt (OR: 1.64). Age had a quadratic association with both outcomes (OR: 0.88 - 1.06). A Substance Abuse Disorder was associated to higher suicidal ideation (OR: 2.67) whilst Developmental Disorders lowered the risk (OR: 0.16 - 0.24).

ConclusionsThis is the first study systematically reporting risk factors for suicidality in people with FDS. Results for the large epilepsy cohort complement previous studies and will be useful in future meta-analyses.

        <p class="abstract">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is associated with a high disease burden, and treatment options are limited. We used intensified electrical stimulation in two dosages to target a main circuitry associated with the pathophysiology of OCD, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and assessed clinical outcomes, neuropsychological performance and brain physiology. In a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial, thirty-nine patients with OCD were randomized to sham, 2-mA or 1-mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the l-DLPFC (F3) and SMA (FC2) with anodal and cathodal stimulation respectively. The treatment included 10 sessions of 20-minute stimulation delivered twice per day with 20-min between-session intervals. Outcome measures were reduction in OCD symptoms, anxiety and depressive states, performance on a neuropsychological test battery of response inhibition, working memory, attention, and oscillatory brain activities and functional connectivity. All outcome measures except EEG were examined at pre-intervention, post-intervention and 1-month follow-up times. The 2-mA protocol significantly reduced OCD symptoms, anxiety, depression states, and improved quality of life after the intervention up to 1-month follow-up compared to the sham group, while the 1-mA protocol reduced OCD symptoms only in the follow-up and depressive state immediately after and 1-month following the intervention. Both protocols partially improved response inhibition, and the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to OCD-related stimuli and improved reaction time in working memory performance. Both protocols increased alpha oscillatory power and the 2-mA intensified protocol decreased delta power as well. Both protocols increased connectivity in higher frequency bands at frontal-central areas compared to the sham. Modulation of the prefrontal-supplementary motor network with intensified tDCS ameliorates OCD clinical symptoms and results in beneficial cognitive effects. The 2-mA intensified stimulation resulted in larger symptom reduction and improved more converging outcome variables related to therapeutic efficacy. These results support applying the intensified prefrontal-SMA tDCS in larger trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent findings link cognitive impairment and inflammatory-immune dysregulation in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BD) spectrum disorders. However, heterogeneity and translation between the periphery and central (blood-to-brain) mechanisms remains a challenge. Starting with a large SZ, BD and healthy control cohort (n=1235), we aimed to i) identify candidate peripheral markers (n=25) associated with cognitive domains (n=9) and elucidate heterogenous immune-cognitive patterns, ii) evaluate the regulation of candidate markers using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells (n=10), and iii) evaluate candidate marker messenger RNA expression in leukocytes using microarray in available data from a subsample of the main cohort (n=776), and in available RNA-sequencing deconvolution analysis of postmortem brain samples (n=474) from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC). We identified transdiagnostic subgroups based on covariance between cognitive domains (measures of speed and verbal learning) and peripheral markers reflecting inflammatory response (CRP, sTNFR1, YKL-40), innate immune activation (MIF) and extracellular matrix remodelling (YKL-40, CatS). Of the candidate markers there was considerable variance in secretion of YKL-40 in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells in SZ compared to HC. Further, we provide evidence of dysregulated RNA expression of genes encoding YKL-40 and related signalling pathways in a high inflammatory subgroup consisting predominantly of SZ in the postmortem brain samples. Our findings suggest a relationship between peripheral inflammatory-immune activity and cognitive impairment, and highlight YKL-40 as a potential marker of cognitive functioning in a subgroup of individuals with severe mental illness.</p>
