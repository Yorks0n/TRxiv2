B.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296284\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often marked by impaired motivation and reward processing, known as anhedonia. Many patients do not respond to first-line treatments, and improvements in motivation can be slow, creating an urgent need for rapid interventions. Recently, we demonstrated that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) acutely boosts effort invigoration in healthy participants, but its effects on depression remain unclear. Objective: To assess the impact of taVNS on effort invigoration and maintenance in a sample that includes patients with MDD, evaluating the generalizability of our findings. Methods: We used a single-blind, randomized crossover design in 30 patients with MDD and 29 matched (age, sex, and BMI) healthy control participants (HCP). Results: Consistent with prior findings, taVNS increased effort invigoration for rewards in both groups during Session 1 (p=.040), particularly for less wanted rewards in HCP (pboot\u003c.001). However, invigoration remained elevated in all participants, and no acute changes were observed in Session 2 ({Delta}invigoration=3.52, p=.093). Crucially, throughout Session 1, we found taVNS-induced increases in effort invigoration (pboot =.008) and wanting (pboot=.010) in patients with MDD, with gains in wanting maintained across sessions ({Delta}wanting=0.06, p=.97). Conclusions: Our study replicates the invigorating effects of taVNS in Session 1 and reveals its generalizability to depression. Furthermore, we expand upon previous research by showing taVNS-induced conditioning effects on invigoration and wanting within Session 1 in patients that were largely sustained. While enduring motivational improvements present challenges for crossover designs, they are highly desirable in interventions and warrant further follow-up research.\nAdherence Behaviors to Prevent COVID: The Role of Anxiety and Prosocial Behaviors\nAuthors: Corbera, S.; Marin-Chollom, A. M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.23295630\nObjectiveIn situations of acute stress, individuals may engage in prosocial behaviors or alternatively, individuals may engage in risk taking self-oriented behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic created large stress-promoting conditions that impacted individuals decisions to adhere to COVID-19 preventative behaviors. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between anxiety during the pandemic and adherence behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the moderating influence prosocial behaviors. Method54 undergraduate students completed online questionnaires during the second wave of the pandemic: prosocial behaviors, anxiety, and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Moderation analyses were conducted using Process in SPSS. ResultsResults demonstrated a statistically significant interaction of public prosocial behavior with state anxiety ({beta} = -.17, p=.01) predicting engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. At low levels of anxiety, low levels of prosocial public behaviors were associated with higher engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. In contrast, high levels of public prosocial behavior were associated with lower engagement in COVID-19 preventative behaviors at low levels of anxiety. ConclusionResults provide information that can aid at in the creation of anxiety reducing interventions that could increase adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors.\nInhibitory control and its modification in spider phobia - study protocol for an antisaccade training trial\nAuthors: Hildebrand, A. S.; Breuer, F.; Leehr, E. J.; Finke, J. B.; Bucher, L.; Klucken, T.; Dannlowski, U.; Roesmann, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295977\nObjectivesInhibitory control deficits are considered a key pathogenic factor in anxiety disorders. To assess inhibitory control, the antisaccade task is a well-established measure, assessing antisaccade performance via latencies and error rates. The present study follows three aims: (1) to investigate inhibitory control via antisaccade latencies and errors in an antisaccade task, and their associations with multiple measures of fear in patients with spider phobia (SP) versus healthy controls (HC), (2) to investigate the modifiability of antisaccade performance via a fear-specific antisaccade training in patients with SP and HC, and (3) to explore associations between putative changes in antisaccade performance in SPs and diverse measures of fear following the training. MethodsTowards aim 1, we assess antisaccade latencies (primary outcome) and error rates (secondary outcome) in an emotional antisaccade task. Further, the baseline assessment includes assessments of psychophysiological, behavioral, and psychometric indices of fear in patients with SP and HCs. To address aim 2, we compare effects of a fear-specific antisaccade training with effects of a prosaccade training as a control condition. The primary and secondary outcomes are reassessed at a post-1-assessment in both SPs and HCs. Aim 3 employs a cross-over design and is piloted in patients with SP, only. Towards this aim, primary and secondary outcomes, as well as psychophysiological, behavioral, and psychometric measures of fear are reassessed at a post-2-assessment after the second training block. ConclusionThis study aims to better understand inhibitory control processes and their modifiability in spider phobia. If successful, antisaccade training may assist in the treatment of specific phobia by directly targeting the putative underlying inhibitory control deficits. This study has been preregistered with ISRCTN (ID: ISRCTN12918583) on 28th February 2022.\nGenetic networks suggest Asperger's Syndrome as a distinct subtype of Autism Spectrum Conditions\nAuthors: Dmytriw, A. A.; Naveed, S.; Ghozy, S.; Morsy, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295892\nBackgroundThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) issued new diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) which excluded cases of Aspergers syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This negatively affected the support received by those affected. In this study, we explored if AS can be considered a subtype of autism. MethodsWe explored if AS is considered a subtype of autism through gene network analysis. We analysed the GEO microarray data of 170 autism patients, then, used a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) pipeline. We explored whether these modules share the same expression patterns across autism subtypes. The study had 170 patients grouped into three groups: AS, autism, and PDD-NOS. ResultsTwenty-one genetic modules were constructed for autism spectrum conditions. However, only AS had a significant downregulation in one of the modules. The module genes were significantly involved in the regulation of proteolysis, catabolic process, and NF-kappaB signalling. Pathway analysis showed the association of these genes with RIPK1-mediated necrosis and regulation of necroptotic cell death. Brain enrichment analysis showed a spatiotemporal distribution. There was significant gene enrichment in the prefrontal cortex during infancy and childhood then it changes in adulthood to be more abundant in the cingulum bundle, and corpus callosum. ConclusionsOur results suggest AS can be a distinct subtype of ASD, showing a similar gene expression pattern. Spatiotemporal distribution of the module genes in different brain regions explains the high functionality in individuals with AS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesInhibitory control deficits are considered a key pathogenic factor in anxiety disorders. To assess inhibitory control, the antisaccade task is a well-established measure, assessing antisaccade performance via latencies and error rates. The present study follows three aims: (1) to investigate inhibitory control via antisaccade latencies and errors in an antisaccade task, and their associations with multiple measures of fear in patients with spider phobia (SP) versus healthy controls (HC), (2) to investigate the modifiability of antisaccade performance via a fear-specific antisaccade training in patients with SP and HC, and (3) to explore associations between putative changes in antisaccade performance in SPs and diverse measures of fear following the training.

MethodsTowards aim 1, we assess antisaccade latencies (primary outcome) and error rates (secondary outcome) in an emotional antisaccade task. Further, the baseline assessment includes assessments of psychophysiological, behavioral, and psychometric indices of fear in patients with SP and HCs. To address aim 2, we compare effects of a fear-specific antisaccade training with effects of a prosaccade training as a control condition. The primary and secondary outcomes are reassessed at a post-1-assessment in both SPs and HCs. Aim 3 employs a cross-over design and is piloted in patients with SP, only. Towards this aim, primary and secondary outcomes, as well as psychophysiological, behavioral, and psychometric measures of fear are reassessed at a post-2-assessment after the second training block.

ConclusionThis study aims to better understand inhibitory control processes and their modifiability in spider phobia. If successful, antisaccade training may assist in the treatment of specific phobia by directly targeting the putative underlying inhibitory control deficits. This study has been preregistered with ISRCTN (ID: ISRCTN12918583) on 28th February 2022.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) issued new diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) which excluded cases of Aspergers syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This negatively affected the support received by those affected. In this study, we explored if AS can be considered a subtype of autism.

MethodsWe explored if AS is considered a subtype of autism through gene network analysis. We analysed the GEO microarray data of 170 autism patients, then, used a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) pipeline. We explored whether these modules share the same expression patterns across autism subtypes. The study had 170 patients grouped into three groups: AS, autism, and PDD-NOS.

ResultsTwenty-one genetic modules were constructed for autism spectrum conditions. However, only AS had a significant downregulation in one of the modules. The module genes were significantly involved in the regulation of proteolysis, catabolic process, and NF-kappaB signalling. Pathway analysis showed the association of these genes with RIPK1-mediated necrosis and regulation of necroptotic cell death. Brain enrichment analysis showed a spatiotemporal distribution. There was significant gene enrichment in the prefrontal cortex during infancy and childhood then it changes in adulthood to be more abundant in the cingulum bundle, and corpus callosum.

ConclusionsOur results suggest AS can be a distinct subtype of ASD, showing a similar gene expression pattern. Spatiotemporal distribution of the module genes in different brain regions explains the high functionality in individuals with AS.</p>
