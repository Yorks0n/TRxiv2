Objectives: To investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers. Methods: We examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). Results: Long COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709). Conclusion: Reactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.\nCortical thickness alterations and systemic inflammation define long-COVID patients with cognitive impairment\nAuthors: Besteher, B.; Rocktaeschel, T.; Garza, A. P.; Machnik, M.; Ballez, J.; Helbing, D. L.; Finke, K.; Reuken, P.; Guellmar, D.; Gaser, C.; Walter, M.; Opel, N.; Dunay, I. R.\nScore: 26.6, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.23292988\nAs the heterogeneity of symptoms is increasingly recognized among long-COVID patients, it appears highly relevant to study potential pathophysiological differences along the different subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests distinct alterations in brain structure and systemic inflammatory patterns in specific groups of long-COVID patients. To this end, we analyzed differences in cortical thickness and peripheral immune signature between clinical subgroups based on 3T-MRI scans and signature inflammatory markers in n=120 participants comprising healthy never-infected controls, healthy COVID-19 survivors, and subgroups of long-COVID patients with and without cognitive impairment according to screening with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Whole-brain comparison of cortical thickness between the 4 groups was conducted by surface-based morphometry. We identified distinct cortical areas showing a progressive increase in cortical thickness across different groups, starting from healthy individuals who had never been infected with COVID-19, followed by healthy COVID-19 survivors, long-COVID patients without cognitive deficits (MoCA [\u0026ge;] 26), and finally, long-COVID patients exhibiting significant cognitive deficits (MoCA \u003c 26). These findings highlight the continuum of cortical thickness alterations associated with COVID-19, with more pronounced changes observed in individuals experiencing cognitive impairment (p\u003c0.05, FWE-corrected). Affected cortical regions covered prefrontal and temporal gyri, insula, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal areas. Additionally, we discovered a distinct immunophenotype, with elevated levels of IL-10, IFN{gamma}, and sTREM2 in long-COVID patients, especially in the group suffering from cognitive impairment. We demonstrate lingering cortical and immunological alterations in healthy and impaired subgroups of COVID-19 survivors. This implies a complex underlying pathomechanism in long-COVID and emphasizes the necessity to investigate the whole spectrum of post-COVID biology to determine targeted treatment strategies targeting specific sub-groups.\nLSD increases sleep duration the night after microdosing\nAuthors: Allen, N.; Jeremiah, A.; Murphy, R.; Sumner, R.; Forsyth, A.; Hoeh, N.; Menkes, D.; Evans, W.; Muthukumaraswamy, S.; Sundram, F.; Roop, P.\nScore: 40.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291970\nMicrodosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nPaediatric traumatic brain injury as a risk factor for psychosis and psychotic symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Yau, K.-C.; Revill, G.; Blackman, G.; Shaikh, M.; Bell, V.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.17.23286118\nBackgroundPsychosis is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Paediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) has been cited as a developmental risk factor for psychosis, however this association has never been assessed meta-analytically. MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between pTBI and subsequent psychotic disorders/symptoms was performed. The study was pre-registered (CRD42022360772) adopting a random-effects model to estimate meta-analytic odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Paule-Mandel estimator. Subgroup (study location, study design, psychotic disorder vs subthreshold symptoms, assessment type, and adult vs adolescent onset) and meta-regression (quality of evidence) analyses were also performed. The robustness of findings was assessed through sensitivity analyses. The meta-analysis is available online as a computational notebook with an open dataset. ResultsWe identified 10 relevant studies and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Based on a pooled sample size of 479,686, the pooled OR for the association between pTBI and psychosis outcomes was 1.80 (95% CI [1.11, 2.95]). There were no subgroup effects and no outliers. Both psychotic disorder and subthreshold symptoms were associated with pTBI. The overall association remained robust after removal of low-quality studies, however the OR reduced to 1.43 (95% CI [1.04, 1.98]). A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed the association was robust to removal of all but one study which changed the estimate to marginally non-significant. ConclusionsWe report cautious meta-analytic evidence for a positive association between pTBI and future psychosis. New evidence will be key in determining long-term reliability of this finding.\nMachine learning-based classification of Alzheimer's disease and its at-risk states using personality traits, anxiety, and depression\nAuthors: Waschkies, K.; Soch, J.; Darna, M.; Richter, A.; Altenstein, S.; Beyle, A.; Brosseron, F.; Buchholz, F.; Butryn, M.; Dobisch, L.; Ewers, M.; Fliessbach, K.; Gabelin, T.; Glanz, W.; Goerss, D.; Gref, D.; Janowitz, D.; Kilimann, I.; Lohse, A.; Munk, M. H.; Rauchmann, B.-S.; Rostamzadeh, A.; Roy, N.; Spruth, E. J.; Dechent, P.; Heneka, M. T.; Hetzer, S.; Ramirez, A.; Scheffler, K.; Buerger, K.; Laske, C.; Perneczky, R.; Peters, O.; Priller, J.; Schneider, A.; Spottke, A.; Teipel, S.; Düzel, E.; Jessen, F.; Wiltfang, J.; Schott, B. H.; Kizilirmak, J. M.\nScore: 17.0, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2022.11.30.22282930\nBackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is often preceded by stages of cognitive impairment, namely subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are established predictors of AD, other non-invasive candidate predictors include personality traits, anxiety, and depression, among others. There predictors offer non-invasive assessment and exhibit changes during AD development and preclinical stages. MethodsIn a cross-sectional design, we comparatively evaluated the predictive value of personality traits (Big Five), geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, apoliprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and CSF biomarkers (tTau, pTau181, A{beta}42/40 ratio) in a multi-class support vector machine classification. Participants included 189 healthy controls (HC), 338 individuals with SCD, 132 with amnestic MCI, and 74 with mild AD from the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE). ResultsMean predictive accuracy across all participant groups was highest when utilizing a combination of personality, depression, and anxiety scores. HC were best predicted by a feature set comprised of depression and anxiety scores and participants with AD were best predicted by a feature set containing CSF biomarkers. Classification of participants with SCD or aMCI was near chance level for all assessed feature sets. ConclusionOur results demonstrate predictive value of personality trait and state scores for AD. Importantly, CSF biomarkers, personality, depression, anxiety, and ApoE genotype show complementary value for classification of AD and its at-risk stages. Key Points- Multi-class support vector machine classification was used to compare the predictive value of well-established and non-invasive, easy-to-assess candidate variables for classifying participants with healthy cognition, subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and mild Alzheimers disease. - Personality traits, geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, ApoE genotype, and CSF biomarkers were comparatively evaluated. - A combination of personality, anxiety, and depression scores provided the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to CSF biomarkers, indicating complementary value. - Established and candidate predictors had limited success in classifying SCD and aMCI, underscoring the heterogeneity of these cognitive states and emphasizing the need for standardizing terminology and diagnostic criteria.\nPredicting prenatal depression and assessing model bias using machine learning models\nAuthors: Huang, Y.; Alvernaz, S.; Kim, S. J.; Maki, P.; Dai, Y.; Penalver Bernabe, B.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292587\nPerinatal depression (PND) is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum period, affecting 10-20% of pregnant individuals. Black and Latina women have higher rates of PND, yet they are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been effective in predicting postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, which contributed to biases in ML models for minority women. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could serve to predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a hospital in a large urban city that mostly served low-income Black and Hispanic women (N=5,875) in the U.S. Depressive symptom severity was assessed from a self-reported questionnaire, PHQ-9. We investigated multiple ML classifiers, used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for model interpretation, and determined model prediction bias with two metrics, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity Difference. While ML model (Elastic Net) performance was low (ROCAUC=0.67), we identified well-known factors associated with PND, such as unplanned pregnancy and being single, as well as underexplored factors, such as self-report pain levels, lower levels of prenatal vitamin supplement intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels blood. Our findings showed that despite being based on a sample mostly composed of 75% low-income minority women (54% Black and 27% Latina), the model performance was lower for these communities. In conclusion, ML models based on EMRs could moderately predict depression in early pregnancy, but their performance is biased against low-income minority women.\nBlood epigenome-wide association studies of suicide attempt in adults with bipolar disorder\nAuthors: Mirza, S.; Lima, C. N. d. C.; Del Favero-Campbell, A.; Rubinstein, A.; Topolski, N. L.; Cabrera-Mendoza, B.; Kovacs, E. H. C.; Blumberg, H. P.; Richards, J. G.; Williams, A. J.; Wemmie, J. A.; Magnotta, V. A.; Fiedorowicz, J. G.; Gaine, M. E.; Walss-Bass, C.; Quevedo, J.; Soares, J. C.; Fries, G. R.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292968\nSuicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at \u003e 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohort's significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD.\nReplication of a neuroimaging biomarker for striatal dysfunction in psychosis\nAuthors: Rubio, J. M.; Lencz, T.; Cao, H.; Kraguljac, N.; Dhamala, E.; Homan, P.; Horga, G.; Sarpal, D.; Argyelan, M.; Gallego, J.; Cholewa, J.; Barber, A.; Kane, J.; Malhotra, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.23292779\nTo bring biomarkers closer to clinical application, they should be generalizable, reliable, and maintain performance within the constraints of routine clinical conditions. The functional striatal abnormalities (FSA), is among the most advanced neuroimaging biomarkers in schizophrenia, trained to discriminate diagnosis, with post-hoc analyses indicating prognostic properties. Here, we attempt to replicate its diagnostic capabilities measured by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic curves discriminating individuals with psychosis (n=101) from healthy controls (n=51) in the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. We also measured the test-retest (run 1 vs 2) and phase encoding direction (i.e., AP vs PA) reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Additionally, we measured effects of scan length on classification accuracy (i.e., AUCs) and reliability (i.e., ICCs). Finally, we tested the prognostic capability of the FSA by the correlation between baseline scores and symptom improvement over 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in a separate cohort (n=97). Similar analyses were conducted for the Yeo networks intrinsic connectivity as a reference. The FSA had good/excellent diagnostic discrimination (AUC=75.4%, 95%CI=67.0%-83.3%; in non-affective psychosis AUC=80.5%, 95%CI=72.1-88.0%, and in affective psychosis AUC=58.7%, 95%CI=44.2-72.0%). Test-retest reliability ranged between ICC=0.48 (95%CI=0.35-0.59) and ICC=0.22 (95%CI=0.06-0.36), which was comparable to that of networks intrinsic connectivity. Phase encoding direction reliability for the FSA was ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59), generally lower than for networks intrinsic connectivity. By increasing scan length from 2 to 10 minutes, diagnostic classification of the FSA increased from AUC=71.7% (95%CI=63.1%-80.3%) to 75.4% (95%CI=67.0%-83.3%) and phase encoding direction reliability from ICC=0.29 (95%CI=0.14-0.43) to ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59). FSA scores did not correlate with symptom improvement. These results reassure that the FSA is a generalizable diagnostic - but not prognostic - biomarker. Given the replicable results of the FSA as a diagnostic biomarker trained on case-control datasets, next the development of prognostic biomarkers should be on treatment-response data.\nNEURAL RESPONSE TO THREAT AND REWARD AMONG YOUNG ADULTS AT RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER\nAuthors: Kirk-Provencher, K. T.; Hakimi, R.; Andereas, K.; Penner, A. E.; Gowin, J. L.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.23292969\nAlcohol use disorder is 50% heritable; those with positive family histories represent an at-risk group within which we can test anticipation of threat and reward prior to development of harmful alcohol use. We examined neural correlates of the interaction between family history, threat anticipation (unpredictable threat), and monetary reward anticipation, in a sample of healthy young adults with (n=31) and without (n=44) family histories of harmful alcohol use. We used a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task with sustained threat of hearing a scream during fMRI. We examined the interaction between family history group, anticipation of threat, and anticipation of reward in the insula, nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex. Family history positive individuals showed less activation in the left insula during both safe and threat blocks compared to family history negative individuals (p=0.005), but the groups did not differ as a function of unpredictable threat (p\u003e0.70). We found an interaction (p=0.048) between cue and group in the right nucleus accumbens where the family history positive group showed less differentiation to the anticipation of gaining $5 and losing $5 relative to gaining $0. The family history positive group also reported less excitement for trials to gain $5 relative to gaining $0 (p\u003c0.001). Prior to chronic heavy alcohol use, individuals with, relative to without, enriched risk may have diminished reward processing via both neural and behavioral markers to potential rewarding and negative consequences. Neural response to unpredictable threat may not be a contributing factor to risk at this stage.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Persistent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reactivation of dormant viruses, and immune-oxidative responses are involved in Long COVID. Objectives: To investigate whether Long COVID and depressive, anxiety and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms, are associated with IgA/IgM/IgG to SARS-CoV-2, human Herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and immune-oxidative biomarkers. Methods: We examined 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls. We measured serum IgA/IgM/IgG against HHV-6 and EBV and their deoxyuridine 5&#39;-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (duTPase), SARS-CoV-2, and activin-A, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). Results: Long COVID patients showed significant elevations in IgG/IgM-SARS-CoV-2, IgG/IgM-HHV-6 and HHV-6-duTPase, IgA/IgM-activin-A, CRP, AOPP, and HOMA2-IR. Neural network analysis yielded a highly significant predictive accuracy of 80.6% for the Long COVID diagnosis (sensitivity: 78.9%, specificity: 81.8%, area under the ROC curve=0.876); the topmost predictors were: IGA-activin-A, IgG-HHV-6, IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-SARS-CoV-2, and IgM-HHV-6 (all positively) and a factor extracted from all IgA levels to all viral antigens (inversely). The top-5 predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID were: IgM-HHV-6-duTPase, IgG-HHV-6, CRP, education, IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy of r=0.636). The top-5 predictors of CFS due to Long COVID were in descending order: CRP, IgG-HHV-6-duTPase, IgM-activin-A, IgM-SARS-CoV-2, and IgA-activin-A (predictive accuracy: r=0.709). Conclusion: Reactivation of HHV-6, SARS-CoV-2 persistence, and autoimmune reactions to activin-A combined with activated immune-oxidative pathways play a major role in the pathophysiology of Long COVID as well as the severity of affective symptoms and CFS due to Long COVID.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the heterogeneity of symptoms is increasingly recognized among long-COVID patients, it appears highly relevant to study potential pathophysiological differences along the different subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests distinct alterations in brain structure and systemic inflammatory patterns in specific groups of long-COVID patients.

To this end, we analyzed differences in cortical thickness and peripheral immune signature between clinical subgroups based on 3T-MRI scans and signature inflammatory markers in n=120 participants comprising healthy never-infected controls, healthy COVID-19 survivors, and subgroups of long-COVID patients with and without cognitive impairment according to screening with Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Whole-brain comparison of cortical thickness between the 4 groups was conducted by surface-based morphometry.

We identified distinct cortical areas showing a progressive increase in cortical thickness across different groups, starting from healthy individuals who had never been infected with COVID-19, followed by healthy COVID-19 survivors, long-COVID patients without cognitive deficits (MoCA [&amp;ge;] 26), and finally, long-COVID patients exhibiting significant cognitive deficits (MoCA &lt; 26). These findings highlight the continuum of cortical thickness alterations associated with COVID-19, with more pronounced changes observed in individuals experiencing cognitive impairment (p&lt;0.05, FWE-corrected). Affected cortical regions covered prefrontal and temporal gyri, insula, posterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal areas. Additionally, we discovered a distinct immunophenotype, with elevated levels of IL-10, IFN{gamma}, and sTREM2 in long-COVID patients, especially in the group suffering from cognitive impairment.

We demonstrate lingering cortical and immunological alterations in healthy and impaired subgroups of COVID-19 survivors. This implies a complex underlying pathomechanism in long-COVID and emphasizes the necessity to investigate the whole spectrum of post-COVID biology to determine targeted treatment strategies targeting specific sub-groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microdosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPsychosis is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Paediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) has been cited as a developmental risk factor for psychosis, however this association has never been assessed meta-analytically.

MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between pTBI and subsequent psychotic disorders/symptoms was performed. The study was pre-registered (CRD42022360772) adopting a random-effects model to estimate meta-analytic odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Paule-Mandel estimator. Subgroup (study location, study design, psychotic disorder vs subthreshold symptoms, assessment type, and adult vs adolescent onset) and meta-regression (quality of evidence) analyses were also performed. The robustness of findings was assessed through sensitivity analyses. The meta-analysis is available online as a computational notebook with an open dataset.

ResultsWe identified 10 relevant studies and eight were included in the meta-analysis. Based on a pooled sample size of 479,686, the pooled OR for the association between pTBI and psychosis outcomes was 1.80 (95% CI [1.11, 2.95]). There were no subgroup effects and no outliers. Both psychotic disorder and subthreshold symptoms were associated with pTBI. The overall association remained robust after removal of low-quality studies, however the OR reduced to 1.43 (95% CI [1.04, 1.98]). A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed the association was robust to removal of all but one study which changed the estimate to marginally non-significant.

ConclusionsWe report cautious meta-analytic evidence for a positive association between pTBI and future psychosis. New evidence will be key in determining long-term reliability of this finding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is often preceded by stages of cognitive impairment, namely subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are established predictors of AD, other non-invasive candidate predictors include personality traits, anxiety, and depression, among others. There predictors offer non-invasive assessment and exhibit changes during AD development and preclinical stages.

MethodsIn a cross-sectional design, we comparatively evaluated the predictive value of personality traits (Big Five), geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, apoliprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and CSF biomarkers (tTau, pTau181, A{beta}42/40 ratio) in a multi-class support vector machine classification. Participants included 189 healthy controls (HC), 338 individuals with SCD, 132 with amnestic MCI, and 74 with mild AD from the multicenter DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE).

ResultsMean predictive accuracy across all participant groups was highest when utilizing a combination of personality, depression, and anxiety scores. HC were best predicted by a feature set comprised of depression and anxiety scores and participants with AD were best predicted by a feature set containing CSF biomarkers. Classification of participants with SCD or aMCI was near chance level for all assessed feature sets.

ConclusionOur results demonstrate predictive value of personality trait and state scores for AD. Importantly, CSF biomarkers, personality, depression, anxiety, and ApoE genotype show complementary value for classification of AD and its at-risk stages.

Key Points- Multi-class support vector machine classification was used to compare the predictive value of well-established and non-invasive, easy-to-assess candidate variables for classifying participants with healthy cognition, subjective cognitive decline, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and mild Alzheimers disease.
- Personality traits, geriatric anxiety and depression scores, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging activity of the default mode network, ApoE genotype, and CSF biomarkers were comparatively evaluated.
- A combination of personality, anxiety, and depression scores provided the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to CSF biomarkers, indicating complementary value.
- Established and candidate predictors had limited success in classifying SCD and aMCI, underscoring the heterogeneity of these cognitive states and emphasizing the need for standardizing terminology and diagnostic criteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Perinatal depression (PND) is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum period, affecting 10-20% of pregnant individuals. Black and Latina women have higher rates of PND, yet they are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have been effective in predicting postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial and ethnic minorities, which contributed to biases in ML models for minority women. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could serve to predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a hospital in a large urban city that mostly served low-income Black and Hispanic women (N=5,875) in the U.S. Depressive symptom severity was assessed from a self-reported questionnaire, PHQ-9. We investigated multiple ML classifiers, used Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for model interpretation, and determined model prediction bias with two metrics, Disparate Impact, and Equal Opportunity Difference. While ML model (Elastic Net) performance was low (ROCAUC=0.67), we identified well-known factors associated with PND, such as unplanned pregnancy and being single, as well as underexplored factors, such as self-report pain levels, lower levels of prenatal vitamin supplement intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels blood. Our findings showed that despite being based on a sample mostly composed of 75% low-income minority women (54% Black and 27% Latina), the model performance was lower for these communities. In conclusion, ML models based on EMRs could moderately predict depression in early pregnancy, but their performance is biased against low-income minority women.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Suicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at &gt; 700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold-changes at the discovery cohort&#39;s significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical predictor in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To bring biomarkers closer to clinical application, they should be generalizable, reliable, and maintain performance within the constraints of routine clinical conditions. The functional striatal abnormalities (FSA), is among the most advanced neuroimaging biomarkers in schizophrenia, trained to discriminate diagnosis, with post-hoc analyses indicating prognostic properties. Here, we attempt to replicate its diagnostic capabilities measured by the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic curves discriminating individuals with psychosis (n=101) from healthy controls (n=51) in the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. We also measured the test-retest (run 1 vs 2) and phase encoding direction (i.e., AP vs PA) reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Additionally, we measured effects of scan length on classification accuracy (i.e., AUCs) and reliability (i.e., ICCs). Finally, we tested the prognostic capability of the FSA by the correlation between baseline scores and symptom improvement over 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in a separate cohort (n=97). Similar analyses were conducted for the Yeo networks intrinsic connectivity as a reference. The FSA had good/excellent diagnostic discrimination (AUC=75.4%, 95%CI=67.0%-83.3%; in non-affective psychosis AUC=80.5%, 95%CI=72.1-88.0%, and in affective psychosis AUC=58.7%, 95%CI=44.2-72.0%). Test-retest reliability ranged between ICC=0.48 (95%CI=0.35-0.59) and ICC=0.22 (95%CI=0.06-0.36), which was comparable to that of networks intrinsic connectivity. Phase encoding direction reliability for the FSA was ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59), generally lower than for networks intrinsic connectivity. By increasing scan length from 2 to 10 minutes, diagnostic classification of the FSA increased from AUC=71.7% (95%CI=63.1%-80.3%) to 75.4% (95%CI=67.0%-83.3%) and phase encoding direction reliability from ICC=0.29 (95%CI=0.14-0.43) to ICC=0.51 (95%CI=0.42-0.59). FSA scores did not correlate with symptom improvement. These results reassure that the FSA is a generalizable diagnostic - but not prognostic - biomarker. Given the replicable results of the FSA as a diagnostic biomarker trained on case-control datasets, next the development of prognostic biomarkers should be on treatment-response data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alcohol use disorder is 50% heritable; those with positive family histories represent an at-risk group within which we can test anticipation of threat and reward prior to development of harmful alcohol use. We examined neural correlates of the interaction between family history, threat anticipation (unpredictable threat), and monetary reward anticipation, in a sample of healthy young adults with (n=31) and without (n=44) family histories of harmful alcohol use. We used a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task with sustained threat of hearing a scream during fMRI. We examined the interaction between family history group, anticipation of threat, and anticipation of reward in the insula, nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex. Family history positive individuals showed less activation in the left insula during both safe and threat blocks compared to family history negative individuals (p=0.005), but the groups did not differ as a function of unpredictable threat (p&gt;0.70). We found an interaction (p=0.048) between cue and group in the right nucleus accumbens where the family history positive group showed less differentiation to the anticipation of gaining $5 and losing $5 relative to gaining $0. The family history positive group also reported less excitement for trials to gain $5 relative to gaining $0 (p&lt;0.001). Prior to chronic heavy alcohol use, individuals with, relative to without, enriched risk may have diminished reward processing via both neural and behavioral markers to potential rewarding and negative consequences. Neural response to unpredictable threat may not be a contributing factor to risk at this stage.</p>
