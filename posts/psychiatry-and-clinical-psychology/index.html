M.; Nandru, R.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294230\nStructured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD. Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment. Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded. Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form. ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce. ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

M.; Niarchou, M.; Goleva, S.; Kabir, D.; Ciarcia, J.; PTSD \u0026 Trauma EHR Working Group, ; Smoller, J.; Davis, L.; Nievergelt, C.; Koenen, K.; Huckins, L. M.; Choi, K. W.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.23294572\nBackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex. MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1+ PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2+ PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression. ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients. ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.\nMenarche, pubertal timing and the brain: female-specific patterns of brain maturation beyond age-related development\nAuthors: Gottschewsky, N.; Kraft, D.; Kaufmann, T.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294880\nBackground: Puberty depicts a period of profound and multifactorial changes ranging from social to biological factors. While brain development in youths has been studied mostly from an age perspective, recent evidence suggests that pubertal measures may be more sensitive to study adolescent neurodevelopment, however, studies on pubertal timing in relation to brain development are still scarce. Methods: We investigated if pre vs. post-menarche status can be classified using machine learning on cortical and subcortical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from strictly age-matched adolescent females from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. For comparison of the identified menarche-related patterns to age-related patterns of neurodevelopment, we trained a brain age prediction model on data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and applied it to the same ABCD data, yielding differences between predicted and chronological age referred to as brain age gaps. We tested the sensitivity of both these frameworks to measures of pubertal maturation, specifically age at menarche and puberty status. Results: The machine learning model achieved moderate but statistically significant accuracy in the menarche classification task, yielding for each subject a class probability ranging from 0 (pre-) to 1 (post- menarche). Comparison to brain age predictions revealed shared and distinct patterns of neurodevelopment captured by both approaches. Continuous menarche class probabilities were positively associated with brain age gaps, but only the menarche class probabilities, not the brain age gaps, were associated with age at menarche. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the use of a machine learning model to classify menarche status from structural MRI data while accounting for age-related neurodevelopment. Given its sensitivity towards measures of puberty timing, our work suggests that menarche class probabilities may be developed toward an objective brain-based marker of pubertal development.\nUsability and Accuracy of the SWIFT-ActiveScreener Preliminary evaluation for use in clinical research\nAuthors: Liu, J. W.; Ein, N.; Gervasio, J.; Easterbrook, B.; Nouri, M. S.; Nazarov, A.; Richardson, J. D.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.23294573\nSystematic reviews (SRs) employ standardized methodological processes for synthesizing empirical evidence to answer specific research questions. These processes include rigorous screening phases to determine eligibility of articles against strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite these processes, SRs are a significant undertaking, and this type of research often necessitates extensive human resource requirements, especially when the scope of the review is large. Given the substantial resources and time commitment required, we investigated a way in which the screening process might be accelerated while maintaining high fidelity and adherence to SR processes. More recently, researchers have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence-based (AI) software to expedite the screening process. This paper evaluated the accuracy and usabiity of a novel, machine learning program, Sciome SWIFT-ActiveScreener (ActiveScreener) in a large SR of mental health outcomes following treatment for PTSD. ActiveScreener exceeded the expected 95% accuracy of the program to predict inclusion or exclusion of relevant articles, and was reported to be user friendly by both novice and seasoned screeners. Our results showed that ActiveScreener, when used appropriately, may save considerable time and human resources when performing SR.\nSex-stratified genomic structural equation models of posttraumatic stress inform PTSD etiology\nAuthors: Moo-Choy, A.; Stein, M.; Gelernter, J.; Wendt, F. R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.23294954\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 3.9%-5.6% of the worldwide population, with well-documented sex-related differences. While psychosocial and hormonal factors affecting sex differences in PTSD and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom etiology have been explored, there has been limited focus on genetic bases of these differences. Many symptom combinations may confer a PTSD diagnosis. We hypothesized that these symptom combinations have sex-specific patterns, the examination of which could inform etiological differences in PTSD genetics between males and females. To investigate this, we performed a sex-stratified multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) in unrelated UK Biobank (UKB) individuals of European ancestry. Using GWAS summary association data, genomic structural equation modeling was performed to generate sex-specific factor models using six indicator variables: trouble concentrating, feeling distant from others, irritability, disturbing thoughts, upset feelings, and avoidance of places/activities which remind the individual of a traumatic event. Models of male and female PTSD symptoms differed substantially (local standardized root mean square difference=3.12) and significantly ({chi}2(5)=28.03, p=3.6x10-5). Independent two-factor models best fit the data in both males and females; these factors were subjected to GWAS in each sex, revealing three genome-wide significant loci in females, mapping to SCAND3, WDPCP, and FAM120A. No genome-wide significant loci were identified in males. All four PTS factors (2 in males and 2 in females) were heritable (p\u003c0.05): male PTS-f1 h2-SNP=1.85%, male PTS-f2 h2-SNP=1.47%, female PTS-f1 h2-SNP=3.87%, female PTS-f2 h2-SNP=3.53%. Male PTS-f1 was enriched for medication-related putative causal relationships (3.73-fold, p=0.032) while male PTS-f2 was enriched for body structure (2.84-fold, p=5.512x10-7) and cognitive (3.22-fold, p=0.009) putative causal relationships. In females, PTS-f1 was enriched for metabolic putative causal relationships (28.08-fold, p=0.035). By assessing the relationship between sex and PTSD symptoms, this study informs correlative and putatively causal etiological differences between males and females which support further investigation of sex differences in PTSD genetics.\nEffect of lifetime exposure to depression on brain structure and function in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Kasper, J.; Eickhoff, S.; Patil, K. R.; Dukart, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294887\nBackground: Depression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort. Methods: We included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume. Results: Across all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations. Conclusion: Lifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.\nMDMA Assisted Psychotherapy Decreases PTSD Symptoms, Dissociation, Functional Disability, and Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Green, W. M.; Raut, S. B.; James, F. L. J.; Benedek, D. M.; Ursano, R. J.; Johnson, L. R.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23293955\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.\nModeling brain sex in the limbic system as phenotype for female-prevalent mental disorders\nAuthors: Matte Bon, G.; Kraft, D.; Comasco, E.; Derntl, B.; Kaufmann, T.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294165\nBackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics. MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample. ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model. ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders. HighlightsO_LIWe assessed sex differences and heritability of limbic and non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LILimbic volumes showed stronger sex differences and higher heritability overall. C_LIO_LIWe trained brain sex classification models on limbic or non-limbic volumes. C_LIO_LIPerformance was high and the sex class probabilities were heritable for all models. C_LIO_LIIn females, limbic estimates were associated with depression diagnosis. C_LI Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSObjectiveC_ST_ABSPostpartum women can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to complicated, traumatic childbirth; prevalence of these events remains high in the U.S. Currently, there is no recommended treatment approach in routine peripartum care for preventing maternal childbirth-related PTSD (CB-PTSD) and lessening its severity. Here, we provide a systematic review of available clinical trials testing interventions for the prevention and indication of CB-PTSD.

Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic review of PsycInfo, PsycArticles, PubMed (MEDLINE), ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, ProQuest, Sociological Abstracts, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus through December 2022 to identify clinical trials involving CB-PTSD prevention and treatment.

Study Eligibility CriteriaTrials were included if they were interventional, evaluated CB-PTSD preventive strategies or treatments, and reported outcomes assessing CB-PTSD symptoms. Duplicate studies, case reports, protocols, active clinical trials, and studies of CB-PTSD following stillbirth were excluded.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis MethodsTwo independent coders evaluated trials using a modified Downs and Black methodological quality assessment checklist. Sample characteristics and related intervention information were extracted via an Excel-based form.

ResultsA total of 33 studies, including 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 8 non-RCTs, were included. Trial quality ranged from Poor to Excellent. Trials tested psychological therapies most often delivered as secondary prevention against CB-PTSD onset (n=21); some examined primary (n=3) and tertiary (n=9) therapies. Positive treatment effects were found for early interventions employing conventional trauma-focused therapies, psychological counseling, and mother-infant dyadic focused strategies. Therapies utility to aid women with severe acute traumatic stress symptoms or reduce incidence of CB-PTSD diagnosis is unclear, as is whether they are effective as tertiary intervention. Educational birth plan-focused interventions during pregnancy may improve maternal health outcomes, but studies remain scarce.

ConclusionsAn array of early psychological therapies delivered in response to traumatic childbirth, rather than universally, in the first postpartum days and weeks, may potentially buffer CB-PTSD development. Rather than one treatment being suitable for all, effective therapy should consider individual-specific factors. As additional RCTs generate critical information and guide recommendations for first-line preventive treatments for CB-PTSD, the psychiatric consequences associated with traumatic childbirth could be lessened.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPrior epidemiological research has linked PTSD with specific physical health problems, but the comprehensive landscape of medical conditions associated with PTSD remains uncharacterized. Electronic health records (EHR) provide an opportunity to overcome prior clinical knowledge gaps and uncover associations with biological relevance that potentially vary by sex.

MethodsPTSD was defined among biobank participants (total N=123,365) in a major healthcare system using two ICD code-based definitions: broad (1&#43; PTSD or acute stress codes versus 0; NCase=14,899) and narrow (2&#43; PTSD codes versus 0; NCase=3,026). Using a phenome-wide association (PheWAS) design, we tested associations between each PTSD definition and all prevalent disease umbrella categories, i.e., phecodes. We also conducted sex-stratified PheWAS analyses including a sex-by-diagnosis interaction term in each logistic regression.

ResultsA substantial number of phecodes were significantly associated with PTSDNarrow (61%) and PTSDBroad (83%). While top associations were shared between the two definitions, PTSDBroad captured 334 additional phecodes not significantly associated with PTSDNarrow and exhibited a wider range of significantly associated phecodes across various categories, including respiratory, genitourinary, and circulatory conditions. Sex differences were observed, in that PTSDBroad was more strongly associated with osteoporosis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, and pulmonary heart disease among male patients, and with urinary tract infection, acute pharyngitis, respiratory infections, and overweight among female patients.

ConclusionsThis study provides valuable insights into a diverse range of comorbidities associated with PTSD, including both known and novel associations, while highlighting the influence of sex differences and the impact of defining PTSD using EHR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Puberty depicts a period of profound and multifactorial changes ranging from social to biological factors. While brain development in youths has been studied mostly from an age perspective, recent evidence suggests that pubertal measures may be more sensitive to study adolescent neurodevelopment, however, studies on pubertal timing in relation to brain development are still scarce. Methods: We investigated if pre vs. post-menarche status can be classified using machine learning on cortical and subcortical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from strictly age-matched adolescent females from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. For comparison of the identified menarche-related patterns to age-related patterns of neurodevelopment, we trained a brain age prediction model on data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and applied it to the same ABCD data, yielding differences between predicted and chronological age referred to as brain age gaps. We tested the sensitivity of both these frameworks to measures of pubertal maturation, specifically age at menarche and puberty status. Results: The machine learning model achieved moderate but statistically significant accuracy in the menarche classification task, yielding for each subject a class probability ranging from 0 (pre-) to 1 (post- menarche). Comparison to brain age predictions revealed shared and distinct patterns of neurodevelopment captured by both approaches. Continuous menarche class probabilities were positively associated with brain age gaps, but only the menarche class probabilities, not the brain age gaps, were associated with age at menarche. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the use of a machine learning model to classify menarche status from structural MRI data while accounting for age-related neurodevelopment. Given its sensitivity towards measures of puberty timing, our work suggests that menarche class probabilities may be developed toward an objective brain-based marker of pubertal development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Systematic reviews (SRs) employ standardized methodological processes for synthesizing empirical evidence to answer specific research questions. These processes include rigorous screening phases to determine eligibility of articles against strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite these processes, SRs are a significant undertaking, and this type of research often necessitates extensive human resource requirements, especially when the scope of the review is large. Given the substantial resources and time commitment required, we investigated a way in which the screening process might be accelerated while maintaining high fidelity and adherence to SR processes. More recently, researchers have increasingly turned to artificial intelligence-based (AI) software to expedite the screening process. This paper evaluated the accuracy and usabiity of a novel, machine learning program, Sciome SWIFT-ActiveScreener (ActiveScreener) in a large SR of mental health outcomes following treatment for PTSD. ActiveScreener exceeded the expected 95% accuracy of the program to predict inclusion or exclusion of relevant articles, and was reported to be user friendly by both novice and seasoned screeners. Our results showed that ActiveScreener, when used appropriately, may save considerable time and human resources when performing SR.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 3.9%-5.6% of the worldwide population, with well-documented sex-related differences. While psychosocial and hormonal factors affecting sex differences in PTSD and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom etiology have been explored, there has been limited focus on genetic bases of these differences. Many symptom combinations may confer a PTSD diagnosis. We hypothesized that these symptom combinations have sex-specific patterns, the examination of which could inform etiological differences in PTSD genetics between males and females. To investigate this, we performed a sex-stratified multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) in unrelated UK Biobank (UKB) individuals of European ancestry. Using GWAS summary association data, genomic structural equation modeling was performed to generate sex-specific factor models using six indicator variables: trouble concentrating, feeling distant from others, irritability, disturbing thoughts, upset feelings, and avoidance of places/activities which remind the individual of a traumatic event. Models of male and female PTSD symptoms differed substantially (local standardized root mean square difference=3.12) and significantly ({chi}2(5)=28.03, p=3.6x10-5). Independent two-factor models best fit the data in both males and females; these factors were subjected to GWAS in each sex, revealing three genome-wide significant loci in females, mapping to SCAND3, WDPCP, and FAM120A. No genome-wide significant loci were identified in males. All four PTS factors (2 in males and 2 in females) were heritable (p&lt;0.05): male PTS-f1 h2-SNP=1.85%, male PTS-f2 h2-SNP=1.47%, female PTS-f1 h2-SNP=3.87%, female PTS-f2 h2-SNP=3.53%. Male PTS-f1 was enriched for medication-related putative causal relationships (3.73-fold, p=0.032) while male PTS-f2 was enriched for body structure (2.84-fold, p=5.512x10-7) and cognitive (3.22-fold, p=0.009) putative causal relationships. In females, PTS-f1 was enriched for metabolic putative causal relationships (28.08-fold, p=0.035). By assessing the relationship between sex and PTSD symptoms, this study informs correlative and putatively causal etiological differences between males and females which support further investigation of sex differences in PTSD genetics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Depression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort. Methods: We included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume. Results: Across all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations. Conclusion: Lifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundProfound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics.

MethodsWe here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample.

ResultsLimbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model.

ConclusionsOverall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.

Plain English SummaryPsychiatric disorders have different prevalence between sexes, with women being twice as likely to develop depression and anxiety across the lifespan. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in brain structure that might contribute to this prevalence but have mostly focused on a single-structure level, potentially overlooking the interplay between brain regions. Sex differences in structures responsible for emotional regulation (limbic system), affected in many psychiatric disorders, have been previously reported. Here, we apply a machine learning model to obtain an estimate of brain sex for each participant based on the volumes of multiple brain regions. Particularly, we compared the estimates obtained with a model based solely on limbic structures with those obtained with a non-limbic model (entire brain except limbic structures) and a whole brain model. To investigate the genetic determinants of the models, we assessed the heritability of the estimates between identical twins and fraternal twins. The estimates of all our models were heritable, suggesting a genetic component contributing to brain sex. Finally, to investigate the association with mental health, we compared brain sex estimates in healthy subjects and in a depressed population. We found an association between depression and brain sex in females for the limbic model, but not for the non-limbic model. No effect was found in males. Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of machine learning models of brain sex based on relevant structures to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.</p>
