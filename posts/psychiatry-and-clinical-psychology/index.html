M.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297097\nBackgroundThe emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana. AimThe aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra. MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD. ResultsThe GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore, being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs. ConclusionCOVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.\nTransdiagnostic failure to adapt interoceptive precision estimates across affective, substance use, and eating disorders: A replication study\nAuthors: Lavalley, C. A.; Hakimi, N.; Taylor, S.; Kuplicki, R.; Forthman, K. L.; Stewart, J. L.; Paulus, M. P.; Khalsa, S. S.; Smith, R.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296870\nRecent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.\nPhysical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services: a scoping review\nAuthors: Tew, G.; Peckham, E.; Ker, S.; Smith, J.; Hodgson, P.; Machaczek, K.; Faires, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297222\nPeople with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.\nWellbeing After Stroke (WAterS): feasibility testing of a co-developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention, to support psychological adjustment after stroke\nAuthors: Patchwood, E.; Foote, H.; Vail, A.; Cotterill, S.; Hill, G.; WAterS PCPI Group, ; Bowen, A.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296276\nObjectiveFeasibility test a co-developed intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to support psychological adjustment post-stroke, delivered by a workforce with community in-reach. DesignObservational feasibility study utilising Patient, Carer, Public Involvement (PCPI). SettingOnline. UK. ParticipantsStroke survivors with self-reported psychological distress 4+ months post-stroke InterventionsThe co-developed Wellbeing After Stroke (WAterS) intervention includes: nine weekly, structured, online, group sessions for stroke survivors, delivered via a training programme to upskill staff without previous ACT experience, under Clinical Psychology supervision. Main measuresFeasibility of recruitment and retention; data quality from candidate measures; safety. Clinical and demographic information at baseline; Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) via online surveys (baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 3 and 6 months after intervention end) including Mood (HADS), Wellbeing (ONS4), Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ5D5L), Psychological Flexibility (AAQ-ABI) and Values-Based Living (VQ). ResultsWe trained eight staff and recruited 17 stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate cognitive and communication difficulties. 12/17 (71%) joined three intervention groups with 98% attendance and no related adverse events. PROMS data were well-completed. The HADS is a possible future primary outcome (self-reported depression lower on average by 1.3 points: 8.5 pre-group to 7.1 at 3 month follow up; 95% CI 0.4 to 3.2). ConclusionThe WAterS intervention warrants further research evaluation. Staff can be trained and upskilled to deliver. It appears safe and feasible to deliver online to groups, and study recruitment and data collection are feasible. Funding has been secured to further develop the intervention, considering implementation and health equality.\nTwo neurostructural subtypes: results of machine learning on brain images from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia\nAuthors: Jiang, Y.; Luo, C.; Wang, J.; Palaniyappan, L.; Chang, X.; Xiang, S.; Zhang, J.; Duan, M.; Huang, H.; Gaser, C.; Nemoto, K.; Miura, K.; Hashimoto, R.; Westlye, L. T.; Richard, G.; Fernandez-Cabello, S.; Parker, N.; Andreassen, O. A.; Kircher, T.; Nenadi?, I.; Stein, F.; Thomas-Odenthal, F.; Teutenberg, L.; Usemann, P.; Dannlowski, U.; Hahn, T.; Grotegerd, D.; Meinert, S.; Lencer, R.; Tang, Y.; Zhang, T.; Li, C.; Yue, W.; Zhang, Y.; Yu, X.; Zhou, E.; Lin, C.-P.; Tsai, S.-J.; Rodrigue, A. L.; Glahn, D.; Pearlson, G.; Blangero, J.; Karuk, A.; pomarol-Clotet, E.; Salvador, R.; Fuentes-Claramonte, Score: 8.6, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.23296862\nMachine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{+/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{+/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Brocas area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.\nDistinct longitudinal brain white matter microstructure changes and associated polygenic risk of common psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Korbmacher, M.; van der Meer, D.; Beck, D.; Askeland-Gjerde, D. E.; Eikefjord, E. N.; Lundervold, A.; Andreassen, O. A.; Westlye, L. T.; Maximov, I. I.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297257\nDuring the course of adulthood and ageing, white matter (WM) structure and organisation are characterised by slow degradation processes such as demyelination and shrinkage. An acceleration of such ageing process has been linked to the development of a range of diseases. Thus, an accurate description of healthy brain maturation, in particular, in terms of WM features, provides a cornerstone in the understanding of ageing. We use longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to provide an overview of WM changes at different spatial and temporal scales in the UK Biobank (UKB) (N=2,678; age[scan 1]=62.38(7.23) years; age[scan 2]=64.81(7.1) years). To examine the genetic overlap between WM structure and common clinical conditions, we tested the associations between WM structure and polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and common psychiatric disorders (uni- and bipolar depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, autism, schizophrenia, attention-deficit-hyperactivity) in longitudinal (N=2,329) and cross-sectional UKB validation data (N=31,056). Global and regional single and multi-compartment fractional anisotropy, intra-axonal water fraction, and kurtosis metrics decreased (mean beta=-0.04),whereas diffusivity metrics, and free water increased with age (mean beta=0.05), with the annual rate of WM change (ARoC) accelerating at higher ages for both global (mean beta=0.01) and regional WM metrics (mean beta=0.01). Voxel-level trends indicated decreasing anisotropy, and variable spatial patterns for other diffusion metrics, suggesting differential changes in frontal compared to other brain regions. Although effect sizes were small (mean absolute beta[all]=0.01), ARoC in middle cerebral peduncle WM had the strongest association with PGRS, especially for Alzheimer's: mean absolute beta=0.01. PGRS were more strongly related to ARoC than cross-sectional measures (d[scan 1]=0.03, d[scan 2]=0.03, d[validation]=0.03). Our findings indicate spatially distributed WM changes across the brain, as well as distributed associations of PGRS with WM. Importantly, brain longitudinal changes reflected the genetic risk for disorder development better than the utilised cross-sectional measures, with regional differences giving more specific insights into gene-brain change associations than global averages.\nBrain-targeted autoimmunity is strongly associated with Long COVID and its chronic fatigue syndrome as well as its affective symptoms.\nAuthors: Almulla, A. F.; Maes, M.; Zhou, B.; Al-Hakeim, H.; Vojdani, A.\nScore: 201.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296554\nBackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has caused a lot of harm to humanity. Healthcare workers who are the leading the charge in the fight against the virus can experience mental health challenges with anxiety being an important illness. Anxiety can become morbid quickly and ultimately affect function, hence the need to study its prevalence among HCWs, since they are a high-risk population. Studies across various regions worldwide reported elevated levels of anxiety amongst HCWs during the SARS, Ebola, and H1N1 pandemics. Nevertheless, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), an easily measured and ubiquitous member of the family of anxiety disorders has hardly been researched. However, new studies in Togo, China, India and Mexico have reported elevated levels of GAD in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexities surrounding mental health care in Ghana, and Africa as a whole it would be expedient to uncover the prevalence of GAD among HCWs during the pandemic. Hence, a study at Family Health Hospital will provide information about the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD among Health care workers representative of Ghana.

AimThe aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related GAD amongst healthcare workers, in a tertiary hospital in Accra.

MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional study design using a self-administered questionnaire was employed. Nine-two (92) HCWs in the study area were sampled. A consecutive sampling technique was used to select the respondents for the study. The study was analyzed using SPSS version 25. The results were presented in summary tables and analyzed using frequencies and percentages. Chi square test performed on categorical data to test association between selected variables and their outcome with COVID-19 related GAD.

ResultsThe GAD level among nurses was 55.4%, and for doctors it was 30.4%. The GAD level among medical laboratory technicians and pharmacists were 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. Furthermore, being age 50-69 years was a significant risk factor for developing GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Female HCWs were more likely to experience GAD. However, only 13.1% of the HCWs were considered to have Corona phobia. Perception of workplace as being high risk was positively correlated with mild to moderate forms of anxiety. However, perception of organizational support as being guaranteed in case one succumbed to the virus and confidence in PPE availability was not reported to be strong protective factors against GAD among HCWs.

ConclusionCOVID-19 related GAD is a challenge amongst HCWs especially nurses in FHH. The management of the FHH should set up certain services such as psychological help lines, peer support programs as well as run a sensitization campaign to cater for the wellbeing of doctors as well as encourage mental health seeking behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">People with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveFeasibility test a co-developed intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to support psychological adjustment post-stroke, delivered by a workforce with community in-reach.

DesignObservational feasibility study utilising Patient, Carer, Public Involvement (PCPI).

SettingOnline. UK.

ParticipantsStroke survivors with self-reported psychological distress 4&#43; months post-stroke

InterventionsThe co-developed Wellbeing After Stroke (WAterS) intervention includes: nine weekly, structured, online, group sessions for stroke survivors, delivered via a training programme to upskill staff without previous ACT experience, under Clinical Psychology supervision.

Main measuresFeasibility of recruitment and retention; data quality from candidate measures; safety. Clinical and demographic information at baseline; Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) via online surveys (baseline, pre- and post-intervention, 3 and 6 months after intervention end) including Mood (HADS), Wellbeing (ONS4), Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ5D5L), Psychological Flexibility (AAQ-ABI) and Values-Based Living (VQ).

ResultsWe trained eight staff and recruited 17 stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate cognitive and communication difficulties. 12/17 (71%) joined three intervention groups with 98% attendance and no related adverse events. PROMS data were well-completed. The HADS is a possible future primary outcome (self-reported depression lower on average by 1.3 points: 8.5 pre-group to 7.1 at 3 month follow up; 95% CI 0.4 to 3.2).

ConclusionThe WAterS intervention warrants further research evaluation. Staff can be trained and upskilled to deliver. It appears safe and feasible to deliver online to groups, and study recruitment and data collection are feasible. Funding has been secured to further develop the intervention, considering implementation and health equality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Machine learning can be used to define subtypes of psychiatric conditions based on shared clinical and biological foundations, presenting a crucial step toward establishing biologically based subtypes of mental disorders. With the goal of identifying subtypes of disease progression in schizophrenia, here we analyzed cross-sectional brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 4,291 individuals with schizophrenia (1,709 females, age=32.5 years{&#43;/-}11.9) and 7,078 healthy controls (3,461 females, age=33.0 years{&#43;/-}12.7) pooled across 41 international cohorts from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group, non-ENIGMA cohorts and public datasets. Using a machine learning approach known as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn), we implemented a brain imaging-driven classification that identifies two distinct neurostructural subgroups by mapping the spatial and temporal trajectory of gray matter (GM) loss in schizophrenia. Subgroup 1 (n=2,622) was characterized by an early cortical-predominant loss (ECL) with enlarged striatum, whereas subgroup 2 (n=1,600) displayed an early subcortical-predominant loss (ESL) in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, brain stem and striatum. These reconstructed trajectories suggest that the GM volume reduction originates in the Brocas area/adjacent fronto-insular cortex for ECL and in the hippocampus/adjacent medial temporal structures for ESL. With longer disease duration, the ECL subtype exhibited a gradual worsening of negative symptoms and depression/anxiety, and less of a decline in positive symptoms. We confirmed the reproducibility of these imaging-based subtypes across various sample sites, independent of macroeconomic and ethnic factors that differed across these geographic locations, which include Europe, North America and East Asia. These findings underscore the presence of distinct pathobiological foundations underlying schizophrenia. This new imaging-based taxonomy holds the potential to identify a more homogeneous sub-population of individuals with shared neurobiological attributes, thereby suggesting the viability of redefining existing disorder constructs based on biological factors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the course of adulthood and ageing, white matter (WM) structure and organisation are characterised by slow degradation processes such as demyelination and shrinkage. An acceleration of such ageing process has been linked to the development of a range of diseases. Thus, an accurate description of healthy brain maturation, in particular, in terms of WM features, provides a cornerstone in the understanding of ageing. We use longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to provide an overview of WM changes at different spatial and temporal scales in the UK Biobank (UKB) (N=2,678; age[scan 1]=62.38(7.23) years; age[scan 2]=64.81(7.1) years). To examine the genetic overlap between WM structure and common clinical conditions, we tested the associations between WM structure and polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and common psychiatric disorders (uni- and bipolar depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, autism, schizophrenia, attention-deficit-hyperactivity) in longitudinal (N=2,329) and cross-sectional UKB validation data (N=31,056). Global and regional single and multi-compartment fractional anisotropy, intra-axonal water fraction, and kurtosis metrics decreased (mean beta=-0.04),whereas diffusivity metrics, and free water increased with age (mean beta=0.05), with the annual rate of WM change (ARoC) accelerating at higher ages for both global (mean beta=0.01) and regional WM metrics (mean beta=0.01). Voxel-level trends indicated decreasing anisotropy, and variable spatial patterns for other diffusion metrics, suggesting differential changes in frontal compared to other brain regions. Although effect sizes were small (mean absolute beta[all]=0.01), ARoC in middle cerebral peduncle WM had the strongest association with PGRS, especially for Alzheimer&#39;s: mean absolute beta=0.01. PGRS were more strongly related to ARoC than cross-sectional measures (d[scan 1]=0.03, d[scan 2]=0.03, d[validation]=0.03). Our findings indicate spatially distributed WM changes across the brain, as well as distributed associations of PGRS with WM. Importantly, brain longitudinal changes reflected the genetic risk for disorder development better than the utilised cross-sectional measures, with regional differences giving more specific insights into gene-brain change associations than global averages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

ObjectivesTo examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B.

MethodsIgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof.

ResultsLong COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801.

ConclusionBrain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>
