F.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301553\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is considered to be a neuroimmune disorder. However, there are no data regarding the association between comprehensive immune profiles and their interactions with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in predicting neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and severity of outpatient MDD (OMDD). MethodsWe assayed 48 serum cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors using a multiplex assay in 67 healthy controls and 66 OMDD patients. Around 50% of the OMDD and control participants had a diagnosis of MetS. ResultsTen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were upregulated in OMDD (i.e., CXCL12, TNFB, PDGF, CCL11, IL9, IL4, CCL5, CCL2, CCL4, IL1RN), indicating an immune, defense and stress response. Six DEPs were downregulated (VEGFA, IL12, CCL3, CSF1, IL1B, NGF), indicating lowered neurogenesis and regulation of neuron death. Significant interactions between OMDD and MetS caused a) substantial increases in TNF signaling, and upregulation of IL4, IL17, TNF, TNFB, CCL2, CCL5, PDGF, IL1RN; and b) downregulation of VEGFA and FGF. A large part of the variance in neuroticism (26.6%), suicidal behaviors (23.6%), and the MDD phenome (31.4%) was predicted by immunological data and interactions between MetS and CCL5, TNFB or VEGFA. DiscussionOMDD is characterized by an immunoneurotoxic profile which partly explains neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and the phenomes severity. Lowered IL-10 and increased neurotoxicity are characteristics of OMDD and other depression phenotypes, including severe first-episode inpatient MDD. The presence of MetS in OMDD considerably exacerbates immunoneurotoxicity. Consequently, immune studies in MDD should always be performed in subjects with and without MetS.\nFeeling at home in a virtually amputated body; Neural and phenomenological effects of illusory embodiment of the desired body in Body Integrity Dysphoria\nAuthors: Saetta, G.; Peter, Y.; Ruddy, K.; Ho, J.; Luechinger, R.; Michels, L.; Lenggenhager, B.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301812\nBody Integrity Dysphoria (BID) is characterized by a profound incongruity between the physical body and a desired, i.e., amputated body, often leading to a desire for limb amputation. Virtual reality (VR) intervention and multisensory stimulation paradigms provide powerful tools to enable transient, illusory embodiment of the desired body, thus experiencing a virtual amputation. This study investigates the impact of VR on neural responses in 18 individuals with BID compared to 18 age and sex matched healthy controls. We used both task-based and resting-state MRI to assess activity when viewing images of the body in the desired versus the undesired state before and after VR, along with functional connectivity measures. In VR, participants played a game with an amputated body, which was adapted for the BID group to simulate their desired bodily shape, seen from a first-person perspective and mimicking the participant's leg movements. Compared to controls, individuals with BID demonstrated a stronger self-reported sense of ownership and control over the virtual body. Task-based fMRI results showed increased activity in the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), right angular gyrus, and right supplementary motor area pre-VR in the BID group, which normalized post-VR. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced connectivity in the rSPL, visuo-occipital areas, fronto-parietal, and fronto-striatal mirror and limb system networks pre-VR, also normalising post-VR. Additionally, there was a normalization in the pattern of increased connectivity of dopaminergic cortico-striatal tracts connecting the rSPL and the pars orbitalis of the right inferior frontal gyrus with the nucleus accumbens. Our findings suggest that virtual embodiment effectively modulates BID-related neural networks, potentially providing a controlled, cost-effective, and safe approach to address body dissatisfaction. They also underscore the significance of VR in unravelling the intricate relationship between the body and self, with potential implications for other psychiatric disorders of the bodily self.\nDevelopment, validation, and clinical utility of Short-term AdVerse-effects of Electroconvulsive therapy (SAVE) Checklist\nAuthors: Uppinkudru, C.; Pathak, H.; K, R. K.; S, B.; Bagali, K.; Pantoji, M.; Ezhumalai, N.; Parlikar, R.; Shah, V.; Balachander, S.; Sreeraj, V. S.; Mehta, U. M.; Sinha, P.; Arumugham, S. S.; Venkatasubramanian, G.; Thirthalli, J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301691\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry. However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.\nLongitudinal pathways between maternal depression, parenting behaviors, and early childhood development: a mediation analysis\nAuthors: Frost, A.; Scherer, E.; Chung, E.; Gallis, J. A.; Sanborn, K.; Zhou, Y.; Hagaman, A.; LeMasters, K.; Sikander, S.; Turner, E. L.; Maselko, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301747\nMaternal depression is a global public health concern with far-reaching impacts on child development, yet our understanding of mechanisms remains incomplete. This study examined whether parenting mediates the association between maternal depression and child outcomes. Participants included 841 rural Pakistani mother-child dyads (50% female). Maternal depression was measured at 12 months postpartum, parenting behaviors (warmth, stimulation, and harsh parenting) were measured at 24 months, and child outcomes (mental health, socioemotional development, and cognitive skills) were measured at 36 months. Maternal depression predicted increased harsh parenting, child mental health difficulties, and child socioemotional concerns; however, there was little evidence for parenting as a mediator between maternal depression and child outcomes. Sex-stratified results are discussed, and findings are situated in context.\nBrain Functional Connectivity and Anatomical Features as Predictors of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Outcome for Anxiety in Youths\nAuthors: Zugman, A.; Ringlein, G. V.; Finn, E. S.; Lewis, K. M.; Berman, E.; Silverman, W.; Lebowitz, E. R.; Pine, D. S.; Winkler, A. M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.24301959\nBackground: Because pediatric anxiety disorders precede the onset of many other problems, successful prediction of response to the first-line treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), could have major impact. However, existing clinical models are weakly predictive. The current study evaluates whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict post-CBT anxiety symptoms. Methods: Two datasets were studied: (A) one consisted of n=54 subjects with an anxiety diagnosis, who received 12 weeks of CBT, and (B) one consisted of n=15 subjects treated for 8 weeks. Connectome Predictive Modeling (CPM) was used to predict treatment response, as assessed with the PARS; additionally we investigated models using anatomical features, instead of functional connectivity. The main analysis included network edges positively correlated with treatment outcome, and age, sex, and baseline anxiety severity as predictors. Results from alternative models and analyses also are presented. Model assessments utilized 1000 bootstraps, resulting in a 95% CI for R2, r and mean absolute error (MAE). Outcomes: The main model showed a mean absolute error of approximately 3.5 (95% CI: [3.1 - 3.8]) points a R2 of 0.08 [-0.14 - 0.26] and r of 0.38 [0.24 - 0.511]. When testing this model in the left-out sample (B) the results were similar, with a MAE of 3.4 [2.8 - 4.7], R2 -0.65 [-2.29 - 0.16] and r of 0.4 [0.24 - 0.54]. The anatomical metrics showed a similar pattern, where models rendered overall low R2. Interpretation: The analysis showed that models based on earlier promising results failed to predict clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample size, the current study does not support extensive use of CPM to predict outcome in pediatric anxiety.\nLarge-Scale Mendelian Randomization Study Reveals Circulating Blood-based Proteomic Biomarkers for Psychopathology and Cognitive Task Performance\nAuthors: Bhattacharyya, U.; John, J.; Lam, M.; Fisher, J.; Sun, B.; Baird, D.; Chen, C.-Y.; Lencz, T.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301455\nBackgroundResearch on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance. MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes. ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance. ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.\nMachine Learning Models Predict the Emergence of Depression in Argentinean College Students during Periods of COVID-19 Quarantine\nAuthors: Lopez Steinmetz, L. C.; Sison, M.; Zhumagambetov, R.; Godoy, J. C.; Haufe, S.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.24301772\nINTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction. METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors. RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features. DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.\nAn International, Cross-Sectional Survey of Psychiatry Researchers and Clinicians: Perceptions of Complementary, Alternative, and Integrative Medicine\nAuthors: Ng, J. Y.; Kochhar, J.; Cramer, H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301718\nBackgroundPsychiatry is a branch of medicine that focuses on mental, behavioural and emotional well-being. Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine has been an increasingly popular choice for patients with psychiatric disorders, therefore our study aimed to explore the perceptions of psychiatry researchers and clinicians on the use of CAIM. MethodsWe conducted an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey for researchers and clinicians who have published their work in psychiatry medical journals that are indexed in MEDLINE. 42,667 researchers and clinicians were sent the link to the survey after extraction of their email addresses from their respective publications. Respondents were asked numerous multiple-choice questions regarding their perceptions on various CAIM therapies, followed by an open-ended question where they could include any additional thoughts. ResultsThe survey was completed by 987 respondents, with a majority identifying as a researcher (n=447, 46.51%), or as both a researcher and a clinician (n=368, 38.29%) within the field of psychiatry. Most respondents (n=629, 78.04%) perceived mind-body therapies such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and yoga to be the most promising CAIM therapy for the prevention, treatment, and management of psychiatric diseases. Many participants said that they agree (n=285, 38.14%) that most CAIM therapies in general are safe, however, many disagree that CAIM therapies are effective (n=245, 32.93%). Respondents indicated that there is value to conducting research on CAIM therapies (n=356, 47.91%), and that there should be more funding allocated to researching these therapies (n=265, 35.71%). Respondents are also in agreement that clinicians should receive training on CAIM therapies through formal education (n=295, 39.76%) or supplementary education (n=380, 51.28%). ConclusionsThe findings from this study showed that there is great interest and potential in researching CAIM within the field of psychiatry. This information can be used as a basis for further research and to develop tailored educational resources for researchers and clinicians in psychiatry.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is considered to be a neuroimmune disorder. However, there are no data regarding the association between comprehensive immune profiles and their interactions with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in predicting neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and severity of outpatient MDD (OMDD).

MethodsWe assayed 48 serum cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors using a multiplex assay in 67 healthy controls and 66 OMDD patients. Around 50% of the OMDD and control participants had a diagnosis of MetS.

ResultsTen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were upregulated in OMDD (i.e., CXCL12, TNFB, PDGF, CCL11, IL9, IL4, CCL5, CCL2, CCL4, IL1RN), indicating an immune, defense and stress response. Six DEPs were downregulated (VEGFA, IL12, CCL3, CSF1, IL1B, NGF), indicating lowered neurogenesis and regulation of neuron death. Significant interactions between OMDD and MetS caused a) substantial increases in TNF signaling, and upregulation of IL4, IL17, TNF, TNFB, CCL2, CCL5, PDGF, IL1RN; and b) downregulation of VEGFA and FGF. A large part of the variance in neuroticism (26.6%), suicidal behaviors (23.6%), and the MDD phenome (31.4%) was predicted by immunological data and interactions between MetS and CCL5, TNFB or VEGFA.

DiscussionOMDD is characterized by an immunoneurotoxic profile which partly explains neuroticism, suicidal behaviors, and the phenomes severity. Lowered IL-10 and increased neurotoxicity are characteristics of OMDD and other depression phenotypes, including severe first-episode inpatient MDD. The presence of MetS in OMDD considerably exacerbates immunoneurotoxicity. Consequently, immune studies in MDD should always be performed in subjects with and without MetS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Body Integrity Dysphoria (BID) is characterized by a profound incongruity between the physical body and a desired, i.e., amputated body, often leading to a desire for limb amputation. Virtual reality (VR) intervention and multisensory stimulation paradigms provide powerful tools to enable transient, illusory embodiment of the desired body, thus experiencing a virtual amputation. This study investigates the impact of VR on neural responses in 18 individuals with BID compared to 18 age and sex matched healthy controls. We used both task-based and resting-state MRI to assess activity when viewing images of the body in the desired versus the undesired state before and after VR, along with functional connectivity measures. In VR, participants played a game with an amputated body, which was adapted for the BID group to simulate their desired bodily shape, seen from a first-person perspective and mimicking the participant&#39;s leg movements. Compared to controls, individuals with BID demonstrated a stronger self-reported sense of ownership and control over the virtual body. Task-based fMRI results showed increased activity in the right superior parietal lobule (rSPL), right angular gyrus, and right supplementary motor area pre-VR in the BID group, which normalized post-VR. Resting-state fMRI revealed reduced connectivity in the rSPL, visuo-occipital areas, fronto-parietal, and fronto-striatal mirror and limb system networks pre-VR, also normalising post-VR. Additionally, there was a normalization in the pattern of increased connectivity of dopaminergic cortico-striatal tracts connecting the rSPL and the pars orbitalis of the right inferior frontal gyrus with the nucleus accumbens. Our findings suggest that virtual embodiment effectively modulates BID-related neural networks, potentially providing a controlled, cost-effective, and safe approach to address body dissatisfaction. They also underscore the significance of VR in unravelling the intricate relationship between the body and self, with potential implications for other psychiatric disorders of the bodily self.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry. However, it has many cognitive and non-cognitive adverse effects (AEs). There are lacunae in the systematic literature on non-cognitive AEs that need a standard, comprehensive and specific clinical tool to evaluate this. Hence, a checklist of short-term AEs of ECT (SAVE) with a 2-phase assessment was developed. Content validation was done using 15 experts ratings and predefined content validity ratio and index (CVR and CVI) in a two-stage modified Delphi method. The checklist had a good CVR and CVI with a final tool of 39 items. The tool was sensitive and identified the non-cognitive AEs after ECT. Cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems displayed the highest incidence. Many participants exhibited delayed recovery in orientation, gait, and stance, highlighting a necessity for meticulous monitoring. SAVE is the first standardised tool to assess short-term ECT-related AEs systematically. This checklist identified a clinically significant incidence of AEs that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Its regular use may enhance the safety of ECT and patient comfort by supporting early identification and intervention for AEs. However, given the transient nature of AEs, further studies are needed to determine their predictive validity for long-term consequences.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Maternal depression is a global public health concern with far-reaching impacts on child development, yet our understanding of mechanisms remains incomplete. This study examined whether parenting mediates the association between maternal depression and child outcomes. Participants included 841 rural Pakistani mother-child dyads (50% female). Maternal depression was measured at 12 months postpartum, parenting behaviors (warmth, stimulation, and harsh parenting) were measured at 24 months, and child outcomes (mental health, socioemotional development, and cognitive skills) were measured at 36 months. Maternal depression predicted increased harsh parenting, child mental health difficulties, and child socioemotional concerns; however, there was little evidence for parenting as a mediator between maternal depression and child outcomes. Sex-stratified results are discussed, and findings are situated in context.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Because pediatric anxiety disorders precede the onset of many other problems, successful prediction of response to the first-line treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), could have major impact. However, existing clinical models are weakly predictive. The current study evaluates whether structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can predict post-CBT anxiety symptoms. Methods: Two datasets were studied: (A) one consisted of n=54 subjects with an anxiety diagnosis, who received 12 weeks of CBT, and (B) one consisted of n=15 subjects treated for 8 weeks. Connectome Predictive Modeling (CPM) was used to predict treatment response, as assessed with the PARS; additionally we investigated models using anatomical features, instead of functional connectivity. The main analysis included network edges positively correlated with treatment outcome, and age, sex, and baseline anxiety severity as predictors. Results from alternative models and analyses also are presented. Model assessments utilized 1000 bootstraps, resulting in a 95% CI for R2, r and mean absolute error (MAE). Outcomes: The main model showed a mean absolute error of approximately 3.5 (95% CI: [3.1 - 3.8]) points a R2 of 0.08 [-0.14 - 0.26] and r of 0.38 [0.24 - 0.511]. When testing this model in the left-out sample (B) the results were similar, with a MAE of 3.4 [2.8 - 4.7], R2 -0.65 [-2.29 - 0.16] and r of 0.4 [0.24 - 0.54]. The anatomical metrics showed a similar pattern, where models rendered overall low R2. Interpretation: The analysis showed that models based on earlier promising results failed to predict clinical outcomes. Despite the small sample size, the current study does not support extensive use of CPM to predict outcome in pediatric anxiety.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundResearch on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance.

MethodsWe utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes.

ResultsMR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance.

ConclusionsIdentification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges, particularly depression among college students. Detecting at-risk students early is crucial but remains challenging, particularly in developing countries. Utilizing data-driven predictive models presents a viable solution to address this pressing need. AIMS: 1) To develop and compare machine learning (ML) models for predicting depression in Argentinean students during the pandemic. 2) To assess the performance of classification and regression models using appropriate metrics. 3) To identify key features driving depression prediction.

METHODSA longitudinal dataset (N = 1492 college students) captured T1 and T2 measurements during the Argentinean COVID-19 quarantine. ML models, including linear logistic regression classifiers/ridge regression (LogReg/RR), random forest classifiers/regressors, and support vector machines/regressors (SVM/SVR), are employed. Assessed features encompass depression and anxiety scores (at T1), mental disorder/suicidal behavior history, quarantine sub-period information, sex, and age. For classification, models performance on test data is evaluated using Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Balanced Accuracy, F1 score, and Brier loss. For regression, R-squared (R2), Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error are assessed. Univariate analyses are conducted to assess the predictive strength of each individual feature with respect to the target variable. The performance of multi- vs univariate models is compared using the mean AUPRC score for classifiers and R2 score for regressors.

RESULTSThe highest performance is achieved by SVM and LogReg (e.g., AUPRC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81) and SVR and RR models (e.g., R2 for SVR and RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.64 and 0.45, 0.63, respectively). Univariate models, particularly LogReg and SVM using depression (AUPRC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) or anxiety scores (AUPRC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) and RR using depression scores (R2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) exhibit performance levels close to those of the multivariate models, which include all features.

DISCUSSIONThese findings highlight the relevance of pre-existing depression and anxiety conditions in predicting depression during quarantine, underscoring their comorbidity. ML models, particularly SVM/SVR and LogReg/RR, demonstrate potential in timely detection of at-risk students, enabling preventive measures for improved mental health outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPsychiatry is a branch of medicine that focuses on mental, behavioural and emotional well-being. Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine has been an increasingly popular choice for patients with psychiatric disorders, therefore our study aimed to explore the perceptions of psychiatry researchers and clinicians on the use of CAIM.

MethodsWe conducted an online, anonymous, cross-sectional survey for researchers and clinicians who have published their work in psychiatry medical journals that are indexed in MEDLINE. 42,667 researchers and clinicians were sent the link to the survey after extraction of their email addresses from their respective publications. Respondents were asked numerous multiple-choice questions regarding their perceptions on various CAIM therapies, followed by an open-ended question where they could include any additional thoughts.

ResultsThe survey was completed by 987 respondents, with a majority identifying as a researcher (n=447, 46.51%), or as both a researcher and a clinician (n=368, 38.29%) within the field of psychiatry. Most respondents (n=629, 78.04%) perceived mind-body therapies such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and yoga to be the most promising CAIM therapy for the prevention, treatment, and management of psychiatric diseases. Many participants said that they agree (n=285, 38.14%) that most CAIM therapies in general are safe, however, many disagree that CAIM therapies are effective (n=245, 32.93%). Respondents indicated that there is value to conducting research on CAIM therapies (n=356, 47.91%), and that there should be more funding allocated to researching these therapies (n=265, 35.71%). Respondents are also in agreement that clinicians should receive training on CAIM therapies through formal education (n=295, 39.76%) or supplementary education (n=380, 51.28%).

ConclusionsThe findings from this study showed that there is great interest and potential in researching CAIM within the field of psychiatry. This information can be used as a basis for further research and to develop tailored educational resources for researchers and clinicians in psychiatry.</p>
