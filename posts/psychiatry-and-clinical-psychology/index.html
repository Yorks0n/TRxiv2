To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients. FundingWellcome Trust (206330/Z/17/Z), NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, the Thuringer Aufbaubank (2021 FGI 0060), German Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FI 1424/2-1) and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union (ITN SmartAge, H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-859890). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\nGhrelin is associated with an elevated mood after an overnight fast in depression\nAuthors: Fahed, R.; Schulz, C.; Klaus, J.; Ellinger, S.; Walter, M.; Kroemer, N. B.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300133\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive. MethodsWe collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T). ResultsPatients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD. LimitationsThe study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention. ConclusionsOur results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.

ObjectiveTo perform a secondary analysis quantifying neural-to-symptom relationships in MDD as a function of antidepressant treatment. DesignDouble blind randomized controlled trial. SettingMulticenter. ParticipantsPatients with early onset recurrent depression from the public Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. InterventionsEither sertraline or placebo during 8 weeks (stage 1), and according to response a second line of treatment for 8 additional weeks (stage 2). Main Outcomes and MeasuresTo identify a data-driven pattern of symptom variations during these two stages, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the variations of individual items of four clinical scales measuring depression, anxiety, suicidal ideas and manic-like symptoms, resulting in a univariate measure of clinical improvement. We then investigated how initial clinical and neural factors predicted this measure during stage 1. To do so, we extracted resting-state global brain connectivity (GBC) at baseline at the individual level using a whole-brain functional network parcellation. In turn, we computed a linear model for each brain parcel with individual data-driven clinical improvement scores during stage 1 for each group. Results192 patients (127 women), age 37.7 years old (standard deviation: 13.5), were included. The first PC (PC1) capturing 20% of clinical variation was similar across treatment groups at stage 1 and stage 2, suggesting a reproducible pattern of symptom improvement. PC1 patients scores significantly differed according to treatment during stage 1, whereas no difference of response was evidenced between groups with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Baseline GBC correlated to stage 1 PC1 scores in the sertraline, but not in the placebo group. Conclusions and RelevanceUsing data-driven reduction of symptoms scales, we identified a common profile of symptom improvement across placebo and sertraline. However, the neural patterns of baseline that mapped onto symptom improvement distinguished between treatment and placebo. Our results underscore that mapping from data-driven symptom improvement onto neural circuits is vital to detect treatment-responsive neural profiles that may aid in optimal patient selection for future trials. Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the data-driven pattern of clinical improvement in major depressive disorder across antidepressants and placebo? FindingsClinical improvement has a shared behavioral geometry across groups but differs in terms of intensity between sertraline and placebo. Baseline resting-state global brain connectivity was correlated to improvement scores in the sertraline group only. MeaningThere is a common behavioral signature of clinical improvement that can be more robustly predicted by baseline neurobehavioral features when it is pharmacologically induced.\nCharacterization of parent and youth-reported eating disorder symptoms and premorbid factors in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\nAuthors: Makowski, C.; Westwater, M. L.; Rhee, K. E.; Bischoff-Grethe, A.; Wierenga, C. E.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300155\nObjectiveEating Disorders (EDs) often start in adolescence, though the prevalence, trajectory of symptom onset and predictors of illness are poorly understood, especially across sociodemographically diverse youth. Here, we leverage data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study, a large demographically representative longitudinal sample of youth in the US, to characterize the prevalence of parent- and youth-reported ED symptoms and their sociodemographic characteristics at baseline (ages 9-11) and two-years later (2-year; ages 11-14). MethodA tetrachoric factor analysis summarized clusters of ED symptoms, which were compared between parent and youth reports. Cognitive, mental and physical health variables at baseline were used to predict youth-reported symptoms at 2-year using a mixed-effects logistic regression. ResultsThree factors emerged reflecting \"weight distress\", \"weight control\", and \"bingeing\", with prevalence rates ranging from 1.5 to 7.3%. All symptoms loaded on similar factors between reporters. Rates of symptom endorsement were similar for males and females, with disproportionately higher rates across factors for youth who self-identified as sexual minority, Hispanic, Black, or Mixed race participants, and those from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, compared to the full ABCD sample. Youth and parent reports at 2-year showed [~]17% overlap. A distinct pattern of cognitive variables emerged as significant predictors of later youth-reported ED concerns, whereas mental health symptoms and traits were non-specific and associated with all ED factors. ConclusionIdentifying the landscape of ED symptoms across demographic groups, reporters and their premorbid factors in late childhood is critical to inform prevention and early intervention efforts, with particularly important implications for historically understudied racial and sexual minority groups.\nUsing Natural Language Processing as a Scalable Mental Status Evaluation Technique\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Jagayat, J.; Kumar, A.; Shirazi, A.; Alavi, N.; Omrani, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300047\nMental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.\nFunctional Disability, Health Care Access, and Mental Health in Ukrainians Displaced by the 2022 Russian Invasion\nAuthors: Kang, T. S.; Head, M. G.; Brackstone, K.; Buchko, K.; Goodwin, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300031\nArmed conflict has negative mental health impacts on internally displaced people and refugees, however, much less is known of its effects upon the mental health of displaced people and refugees with disabilities. We use Europe-wide data (N = 9679), collected via an internet health needs survey across April-July 2022, to examine the mental health impacts of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the mental health of displaced people with disabilities during the first months of the war. Regression models separately examined associations between functional impairment (vision, walking, existing mental health conditions), access to healthcare, welfare payments, anxiety, and sleep quality, controlling for a number of sociodemographic variables including preferred language spoken at home, as an indicator of Russian or Ukrainian cultural identity. The presence of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, mobility and vision impairment were each associated with higher levels of anxiety and poorer sleep quality. The ability to access health services and social security payments was also associated with better sleep and lower levels of anxiety. Humanitarian and local authorities must ensure Ukrainian refugees and IDPs are reviewed for their mental health needs, with particular attention to those with known disabilities.\nAssessing the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia\nAuthors: Woolway, G. E.; Legge, S. E.; Lynham, A.; Smart, S. E.; Hubbard, L.; Daniel, E. R.; Pardinas, A. F.; Escott-Price, V. F.; O'Donovan, M. C.; Owen, M. J.; Jones, I. R.; Walters, J. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299622\nBackgroundDiagnoses in psychiatric research can be derived from various sources. This study assesses the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia. MethodsThe study included 3,029 clinically ascertained participants with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders diagnosed by self-report and/or research interview and 1,453 UK Biobank participants with self-report and/or medical record diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder depressed-type (SA-D). We assessed positive predictive values (PPV) of self-reported clinical diagnoses against research interview and medical record diagnoses. We compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) and phenotypes across diagnostic groups, and compared the variance explained by schizophrenia PRS to samples in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). ResultsIn the clinically ascertained sample, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a research diagnosis of schizophrenia was 0.70, which increased to 0.81 when benchmarked against schizophrenia or SA-D. In UK Biobank, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a medical record diagnosis was 0.74. Compared to self-report participants, those with a research diagnosis were younger and more likely to have a high school qualification (clinically ascertained sample) and those with a medical record diagnosis were less likely to be employed or have a high school qualification (UK Biobank). Schizophrenia PRS did not differ between participants that had a diagnosis from self-report, research diagnosis or medical record diagnosis. Polygenic liability r2, for all diagnosis definitions, fell within the distribution of PGC schizophrenia cohorts. ConclusionsSelf-report measures of schizophrenia are justified in research to maximise sample size and representativeness, although within sample validation of diagnoses is recommended.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive.

MethodsWe collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T).

ResultsPatients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD.

LimitationsThe study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention.

ConclusionsOur results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.

        <p class="abstract">ImportanceUnderstanding the mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) improvement is a key challenge to determine effective personalized treatments.

ObjectiveTo perform a secondary analysis quantifying neural-to-symptom relationships in MDD as a function of antidepressant treatment.

DesignDouble blind randomized controlled trial.

SettingMulticenter.

ParticipantsPatients with early onset recurrent depression from the public Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study.

InterventionsEither sertraline or placebo during 8 weeks (stage 1), and according to response a second line of treatment for 8 additional weeks (stage 2).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresTo identify a data-driven pattern of symptom variations during these two stages, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the variations of individual items of four clinical scales measuring depression, anxiety, suicidal ideas and manic-like symptoms, resulting in a univariate measure of clinical improvement. We then investigated how initial clinical and neural factors predicted this measure during stage 1. To do so, we extracted resting-state global brain connectivity (GBC) at baseline at the individual level using a whole-brain functional network parcellation. In turn, we computed a linear model for each brain parcel with individual data-driven clinical improvement scores during stage 1 for each group.

Results192 patients (127 women), age 37.7 years old (standard deviation: 13.5), were included. The first PC (PC1) capturing 20% of clinical variation was similar across treatment groups at stage 1 and stage 2, suggesting a reproducible pattern of symptom improvement. PC1 patients scores significantly differed according to treatment during stage 1, whereas no difference of response was evidenced between groups with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Baseline GBC correlated to stage 1 PC1 scores in the sertraline, but not in the placebo group.

Conclusions and RelevanceUsing data-driven reduction of symptoms scales, we identified a common profile of symptom improvement across placebo and sertraline. However, the neural patterns of baseline that mapped onto symptom improvement distinguished between treatment and placebo. Our results underscore that mapping from data-driven symptom improvement onto neural circuits is vital to detect treatment-responsive neural profiles that may aid in optimal patient selection for future trials.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the data-driven pattern of clinical improvement in major depressive disorder across antidepressants and placebo?

FindingsClinical improvement has a shared behavioral geometry across groups but differs in terms of intensity between sertraline and placebo. Baseline resting-state global brain connectivity was correlated to improvement scores in the sertraline group only.

MeaningThere is a common behavioral signature of clinical improvement that can be more robustly predicted by baseline neurobehavioral features when it is pharmacologically induced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveEating Disorders (EDs) often start in adolescence, though the prevalence, trajectory of symptom onset and predictors of illness are poorly understood, especially across sociodemographically diverse youth. Here, we leverage data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study, a large demographically representative longitudinal sample of youth in the US, to characterize the prevalence of parent- and youth-reported ED symptoms and their sociodemographic characteristics at baseline (ages 9-11) and two-years later (2-year; ages 11-14).

MethodA tetrachoric factor analysis summarized clusters of ED symptoms, which were compared between parent and youth reports. Cognitive, mental and physical health variables at baseline were used to predict youth-reported symptoms at 2-year using a mixed-effects logistic regression.

ResultsThree factors emerged reflecting &#34;weight distress&#34;, &#34;weight control&#34;, and &#34;bingeing&#34;, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.5 to 7.3%. All symptoms loaded on similar factors between reporters. Rates of symptom endorsement were similar for males and females, with disproportionately higher rates across factors for youth who self-identified as sexual minority, Hispanic, Black, or Mixed race participants, and those from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background, compared to the full ABCD sample. Youth and parent reports at 2-year showed [~]17% overlap. A distinct pattern of cognitive variables emerged as significant predictors of later youth-reported ED concerns, whereas mental health symptoms and traits were non-specific and associated with all ED factors.

ConclusionIdentifying the landscape of ED symptoms across demographic groups, reporters and their premorbid factors in late childhood is critical to inform prevention and early intervention efforts, with particularly important implications for historically understudied racial and sexual minority groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services significantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natural language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Armed conflict has negative mental health impacts on internally displaced people and refugees, however, much less is known of its effects upon the mental health of displaced people and refugees with disabilities. We use Europe-wide data (N = 9679), collected via an internet health needs survey across April-July 2022, to examine the mental health impacts of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the mental health of displaced people with disabilities during the first months of the war. Regression models separately examined associations between functional impairment (vision, walking, existing mental health conditions), access to healthcare, welfare payments, anxiety, and sleep quality, controlling for a number of sociodemographic variables including preferred language spoken at home, as an indicator of Russian or Ukrainian cultural identity. The presence of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, mobility and vision impairment were each associated with higher levels of anxiety and poorer sleep quality. The ability to access health services and social security payments was also associated with better sleep and lower levels of anxiety. Humanitarian and local authorities must ensure Ukrainian refugees and IDPs are reviewed for their mental health needs, with particular attention to those with known disabilities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDiagnoses in psychiatric research can be derived from various sources. This study assesses the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.

MethodsThe study included 3,029 clinically ascertained participants with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders diagnosed by self-report and/or research interview and 1,453 UK Biobank participants with self-report and/or medical record diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder depressed-type (SA-D). We assessed positive predictive values (PPV) of self-reported clinical diagnoses against research interview and medical record diagnoses. We compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) and phenotypes across diagnostic groups, and compared the variance explained by schizophrenia PRS to samples in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC).

ResultsIn the clinically ascertained sample, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a research diagnosis of schizophrenia was 0.70, which increased to 0.81 when benchmarked against schizophrenia or SA-D. In UK Biobank, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a medical record diagnosis was 0.74. Compared to self-report participants, those with a research diagnosis were younger and more likely to have a high school qualification (clinically ascertained sample) and those with a medical record diagnosis were less likely to be employed or have a high school qualification (UK Biobank). Schizophrenia PRS did not differ between participants that had a diagnosis from self-report, research diagnosis or medical record diagnosis. Polygenic liability r2, for all diagnosis definitions, fell within the distribution of PGC schizophrenia cohorts.

ConclusionsSelf-report measures of schizophrenia are justified in research to maximise sample size and representativeness, although within sample validation of diagnoses is recommended.</p>
