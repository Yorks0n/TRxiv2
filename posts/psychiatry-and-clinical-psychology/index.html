To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing. MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group). FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention. InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients. FundingWellcome Trust (206330/Z/17/Z), NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, the Thuringer Aufbaubank (2021 FGI 0060), German Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FI 1424/2-1) and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union (ITN SmartAge, H2020-MSCA-ITN-2019-859890). Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown. Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions. Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.\nGhrelin is associated with an elevated mood after an overnight fast in depression\nAuthors: Fahed, R.; Schulz, C.; Klaus, J.; Ellinger, S.; Walter, M.; Kroemer, N. B.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.23300133\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive. Methods: We collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T). Results: Patients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD. Limitations: The study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention. Conclusions: Our results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.\nAssociations between early-life mental health and abnormal sleep duration in midlife: findings from a prospective cohort study in Great Britain\nAuthors: Metherell, T. E.; Ploubidis, G. B.; Moreno-Agostino, D.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299897\nObjectivesTo quantify the association between the state of mental health in childhood and sleep duration at age 46-48 in the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). DesignBCS70 is a prospective birth cohort study of a population-representative sample. SettingData collection was conducted in participants homes across Great Britain. ParticipantsAll individuals born in one week in April 1970 and resident in the UK are eligible to take part, including those born outside the UK who subsequently immigrated. The study has more than 17,000 participants, of whom 8,581 responded at the last available sweep at age 46-48. Main outcome measuresAverage nightly sleep duration at age 46-48, as assessed by five separate methods: self-report, inference from a sleep diary and three algorithms used to process accelerometry data collected using a thigh-worn activPAL 3 device. ResultsAll seven measures of childhood mental ill-health were positively associated with abnormal self-reported sleep duration. Five were associated with abnormal diary-derived estimates and four were associated with abnormal estimates from an accelerometry-based algorithm. Strengths of associations vary. Adjusting for adult mental health symptoms partially attenuated the associations with self-reported sleep duration but not with the more objective estimates. ConclusionsPoor mental health in childhood is associated with abnormal nightly sleep duration at age 46-48. Post-hoc analyses suggest that this association might not be entirely mediated by poor mental health in adulthood. Future research should attempt to replicate these results in diverse samples and assess whether stronger interventions in early-life mental health might have substantial and long-lasting positive impacts on sleep. SummaryWhat is already known on this topic O_LIThe state of a persons mental health in their early life is associated with a range of adult health outcomes. C_LIO_LIThere exists a bidirectional and multifaceted relationship between the state of a persons mental health and their sleep. C_LIO_LIThe longitudinal association between early-life mental health and sleep in adulthood was not well understood. C_LI What this study adds O_LIOur study demonstrates that early-life mental health is associated with an abnormal average nightly sleep duration at age 46 in this sample. C_LIO_LIAssociations between early-life mental health and abnormal average nightly sleep at age 46 were not fully mediated by adult mental health. C_LI\nA common symptom geometry of mood improvement under sertraline and placebo associated with distinct neural patterns\nAuthors: Berkovitch, L.; Lee, K.; Ji, J. L.; Helmer, M.; Rahmati, M.; Demsar, J.; Kraljic, A.; Matkovic, A.; Tamayo, Z.; Murray, J. D.; Repovs, G.; Krystal, J. H.; Martin, W. J.; Fonteneau, C.; Anticevic, A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300019\nImportance: Understanding the mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) improvement is a key challenge to determine effective personalized treatments. Objective: To perform a secondary analysis quantifying neural-to-symptom relationships in MDD as a function of antidepressant treatment. Design: Double blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: Multicenter. Participants: Patients with early onset recurrent depression from the public Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. Interventions: Either sertraline or placebo during 8 weeks (stage 1), and according to response a second line of treatment for 8 additional weeks (stage 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: To identify a data-driven pattern of symptom variations during these two stages, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the variations of individual items of four clinical scales measuring depression, anxiety, suicidal ideas and manic-like symptoms, resulting in a univariate measure of clinical improvement. We then investigated how initial clinical and neural factors predicted this measure during stage 1. To do so, we extracted resting-state global brain connectivity (GBC) at baseline at the individual level using a whole-brain functional network parcellation. In turn, we computed a linear model for each brain parcel with individual data-driven clinical improvement scores during stage 1 for each group. Results: 192 patients (127 women), age 37.7 years old (standard deviation: 13.5), were included. The first PC (PC1) capturing 20% of clinical variation was similar across treatment groups at stage 1 and stage 2, suggesting a reproducible pattern of symptom improvement. PC1 patients' scores significantly differed according to treatment during stage 1, whereas no difference of response was evidenced between groups with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Baseline GBC correlated to stage 1 PC1 scores in the sertraline, but not in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Using data-driven reduction of symptoms scales, we identified a common profile of symptom improvement across placebo and sertraline. However, the neural patterns of baseline that mapped onto symptom improvement distinguished between treatment and placebo. Our results underscore that mapping from data-driven symptom improvement onto neural circuits is vital to detect treatment-responsive neural profiles that may aid in optimal patient selection for future trials.\nModelling model-based and model-free decision-making in a transdiagnostic sample to investigate disorder-specific and transdiagnostic alterations\nAuthors: Knolle, F.; Sen, P.; Culbreth, A. J.; Koch, K.; Schmitz-Koep, B.; Guersel, D. A.; Wunderlich, K.; Avram, M.; Sorg, C.; Brandl, F.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299814\nAlterations in decision-making have been suggested to underlie different psychiatric illnesses, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. Studies report overlapping and divergent alterations in individuals diagnosed with these disorders, which have been linked to symptoms of the respective disorders. One symptom characterizing all these disorders is impaired decision-making. To facilitate early diagnosis and treatment among these disorders which may also show comorbidities among each other, it is crucial to disentangle alterations in decision-making that are unique to specific disorders, from those that occur across diagnostic boundaries. Recent developments in computational modelling have enabled a mechanistic deconstruction of decision-making processes, facilitating the identification of disorder specific and disorder general alterations. We, therefore, employed two computational modelling approaches on to a two-step Markov decision task in a transdiagnostic cohort combining individuals diagnosed with MDD (N=23), OCD (N=25), and schizophrenia (N=27) to identify disorder specific and disorder general decision-making alterations, and associations with symptoms. The results revealed overall reliance on model-free decision-making behavior across all participants. Additionally, schizophrenia patients showed the lowest learning rate in stage one and highest switching rate (lowest perseverance) compared to all other groups. All patient groups were more random in their response profiles than controls in stage two, with schizophrenia patients revealing highest levels of randomness, while OCD patients were additionally more random in stage one compared to controls and MDD patients. Importantly, the findings revealed a correlation between increased model-free behavior and elevated depressive symptoms, while more model-based choices were linked to lower levels of anhedonia across all patients. Consequently, this study shows noteworthy disorder general and disorder specific decision-making alterations in individuals diagnosed with MDD, OCD, and schizophrenia, suggesting that concurrent alterations and symptoms might potentially have common underlying behavioral mechanisms.\nUsing Natural Language Processing as a Scalable Mental Status Evaluation Technique\nAuthors: Wagner, M.; Jagayat, J.; Kumar, A.; Shirazi, A.; Alavi, N.; Omrani, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300047\nMental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services sig- nificantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natu- ral language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.\nMolecular and micro-architectural mapping of abnormal gray matter developmental trajectories in psychosis\nAuthors: Garcia-San-Martin, N.; Bethlehem, R. A.; Mihalik, A.; Seidlitz, J.; Sebenius, I.; Aleman Morillo, C.; Dorfschmidt, L.; Shafiei, G.; Ortiz Garcia de la Foz, V.; Merrit, K.; David, A.; Morgan, S. E.; Ruiz Veguilla, M.; Ayesa Arriola, R.; Vazquez Bourgon, J.; Alexander Bloch, A.; Misic, B.; Bullmore, E. T.; Suckling, J.; Crespo Facorro, B.; Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium, ; Romero-Garcia, R.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299652\nThe psychosis spectrum encompasses a heterogeneous range of clinical conditions associated with abnormal brain development. The molecular and micro-architectural attributes that account for structural deviations from typical neurodevelopment are still unknown. Here, we aggregate magnetic resonance imaging data from 38,696 healthy controls and 1,256 psychosis-related cases, including first-degree relatives, psychotic experiences, first-episodes, and chronic conditions. Using normative modeling, we generated centile scores for cortical gray matter phenotypes, identifying deviations in regional volumes below the expected trajectory for all conditions. Additionally, we mapped 46 neurobiological features from healthy individuals (including neurotransmitters, cell types, layer thickness, microstructure, cortical expansion, and metabolism) to these centiles using a multivariate approach. Results revealed that neurobiological features were highly co-localized with centile deviations, where metabolism and neurotransmitter concentrations showed the most consistent spatial overlap with abnormal developmental trajectories. These findings shed light on the vulnerability factors that may underlie atypical brain maturation during different stages of psychosis.\nFunctional Disability, Health Care Access, and Mental Health in Ukrainians Displaced by the 2022 Russian Invasion\nAuthors: Kang, T. S.; Head, M. G.; Brackstone, K.; Buchko, K.; Goodwin, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23300031\nArmed conflict has negative mental health impacts on internally displaced people and refugees, however, much less is known of its effects upon the mental health of displaced people and refugees with disabilities. We use Europe-wide data (N = 9679), collected via an internet health needs survey across April-July 2022, to examine the mental health impacts of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the mental health of displaced people with disabilities during the first months of the war. Regression models separately examined associations between functional impairment (vision, walking, existing mental health conditions), access to healthcare, welfare payments, anxiety, and sleep quality, controlling for a number of sociodemographic variables including preferred language spoken at home, as an indicator of Russian or Ukrainian cultural identity. The presence of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, mobility and vision impairment were each associated with higher levels of anxiety and poorer sleep quality. The ability to access health services and social security payments was also associated with better sleep and lower levels of anxiety. Humanitarian and local authorities must ensure Ukrainian refugees and IDPs are reviewed for their mental health needs, with particular attention to those with known disabilities.\nAssessing the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia\nAuthors: Woolway, G. E.; Legge, S. E.; Lynham, A.; Smart, S. E.; Hubbard, L.; Daniel, E. R.; Pardinas, A. F.; Escott-Price, V. F.; O'Donovan, M. C.; Owen, M. J.; Jones, I. R.; Walters, J. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299622\nBackgroundDiagnoses in psychiatric research can be derived from various sources. This study assesses the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia. MethodsThe study included 3,029 clinically ascertained participants with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders diagnosed by self-report and/or research interview and 1,453 UK Biobank participants with self-report and/or medical record diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder depressed-type (SA-D). We assessed positive predictive values (PPV) of self-reported clinical diagnoses against research interview and medical record diagnoses. We compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) and phenotypes across diagnostic groups, and compared the variance explained by schizophrenia PRS to samples in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). ResultsIn the clinically ascertained sample, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a research diagnosis of schizophrenia was 0.70, which increased to 0.81 when benchmarked against schizophrenia or SA-D. In UK Biobank, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a medical record diagnosis was 0.74. Compared to self-report participants, those with a research diagnosis were younger and more likely to have a high school qualification (clinically ascertained sample) and those with a medical record diagnosis were less likely to be employed or have a high school qualification (UK Biobank). Schizophrenia PRS did not differ between participants that had a diagnosis from self-report, research diagnosis or medical record diagnosis. Polygenic liability r2, for all diagnosis definitions, fell within the distribution of PGC schizophrenia cohorts. ConclusionsSelf-report measures of schizophrenia are justified in research to maximise sample size and representativeness, although within sample validation of diagnoses is recommended.\nBrain-charting autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder reveals distinct and overlapping neurobiology\nAuthors: Bedford, S. A.; Lai, M.-C.; Lombardo, M. V.; Chakrabarti, B.; Ruigrok, A.; Suckling, J.; Anagnostou, E.; Lerch, J. P.; Taylor, M.; Nicolson, R.; Stelios, G.; Crosbie, J.; Schachar, R.; Kelley, E.; Jones, J.; Arnold, P. D.; Courchesne, E.; Pierce, K.; Eyler, L. T.; Campbell, K.; Carter Barnes, C.; Seidlitz, J.; Alexander-Bloch, A. F.; Bullmore, E. T.; Baron-Cohen, S.; Bethlehem, R. A.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299587\nBackgroundAutism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions with complex underlying neurobiology. Despite overlapping presentation and sex-biased prevalence, autism and ADHD are rarely studied together, and sex differences are often overlooked. Normative modelling provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in neurodivergent brain development. MethodsHere we use normative modelling and a large, multi-site neuroimaging dataset to characterise cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of typical brain development based on a sample of over 75,000 individuals. We also examined sex and age differences, relationship with autistic traits, and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD (autism+ADHD). ResultsWe observed robust neuroanatomical signatures of both autism and ADHD. Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localised to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global effects of cortical thickness increases but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The autism+ADHD group displayed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness, and certain decreases in surface area. We also found evidence that sex modulates the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only. ConclusionsThese results indicate distinct cortical differences in autism and ADHD that are differentially impacted by age, sex, and potentially unique patterns related to their co-occurrence.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCOVID-19 survivors may suffer from a wide range of chronic cognitive symptoms for months or years as part of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC). To date, there is no definitive objective cognitive marker for PCC. We hypothesised that a key common deficit in people with PCC might be generalised cognitive slowing.

MethodsTo examine cognitive slowing, PCC patients completed two short web-based cognitive tasks, Simple Reaction Time (SRT) and Number Vigilance Test (NVT). 270 patients diagnosed with PCC at two different clinics in UK and Germany were compared to two control groups: individuals who contracted COVID-19 before but did not experience PCC after recovery (No-PCC group) and uninfected individuals (No-COVID group).

FindingsWe identified pronounced cognitive slowing in PCC patients, which distinguished them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. Cognitive slowing was evident even on a 30-second task measuring simple reaction time (SRT), with PCC patients responding to stimuli [~]3 standard deviations slower than healthy controls. This finding was replicated across two clinic samples in Germany and the UK. Comorbidities such as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and post-traumatic stress disorder did not account for the extent of cognitive slowing in PCC patients. Furthermore, cognitive slowing on the SRT was highly correlated with the poor performance of PCC patients on the NVT measure of sustained attention.

InterpretationTogether, these results robustly demonstrate pronounced cognitive slowing in people with PCC, which distinguishes them from age-matched healthy individuals who previously had symptomatic COVID-19 but did not manifest PCC. This might be an important factor contributing to some of the cognitive impairments reported in PCC patients.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched Google Scholar and PubMed for original research or review articles about the cognitive impairment after COVID-19, published up to 3 December 2023. We used terms relating to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, influenza), post-acute symptoms (long COVID, post-COVID conditions, Post-Acute COVID Syndrome) and cognitive impairment (brain fog, cognitive deficit). Previous studies have shown that some people who recovered from the acute symptoms of COVID-19 might nevertheless experience deficits across an array of cognitive functions, including sustained attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory. However, most reports lacked consensus on the precise definition of post-COVID conditions and a common cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions remains unknown.

Added value of this studyIn this investigation, we identified moderate to severe cognitive slowing in most patients with PCC, but not in most people who previously suffered COVID without developing PCC. This was replicated across two post-COVID clinics in Germany and the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first robust demonstration of cognitive slowing as a cognitive signature of post-COVID conditions.

Implications of all the available evidenceUsing a 30-second web-based, self-administered psychomotor task, cognitive slowing in PCC can be reliably and easily measured as part of diagnostic work-up, and has potential to be a biomarker to track the progress of rehabilitation of PCC. To encourage researchers and clinicians to employ this task, we have ensured that it is available online with online feedback and all of our code is publicly accessible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) comprises subtypes with distinct symptom profiles. For example, patients with melancholic and atypical MDD differ in the direction of appetite and body weight changes as well as mood reactivity. Despite reported links to altered energy metabolism, the role of circulating neuropeptides from the gut in modulating such symptoms remains largely elusive. Methods: We collected data from 103 participants, including 51 patients with MDD and 52 healthy control participants (HCP). After an overnight fast, we measured blood levels of (acyl and des-acyl) ghrelin and participants reported their current metabolic and mood states using visual analog scales (VAS). Furthermore, they completed symptom-related questionnaires (i.e., STAI-T). Results: Patients with atypical versus melancholic MDD reported less negative affect (p = .025). Higher levels of acyl ghrelin (corrected for BMI) were associated with improved mood (p = .012), specifically in patients with MDD. These associations of ghrelin were not mood-item specific and exceeded correlations with trait markers of negative affectivity. In contrast to associations with mood state, higher levels of ghrelin were not associated with increased hunger per se or changes in appetite in patients with MDD. Limitations: The study is limited by the cross-sectional design without an intervention. Conclusions: Our results reveal potentially mood-enhancing effects of ghrelin in fasting individuals that exceed associations with metabolic state ratings. These associations with circulating neuropeptides might help explain anti-depressive effects of fasting interventions and could complement conventional treatments in patients with melancholic MDD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo quantify the association between the state of mental health in childhood and sleep duration at age 46-48 in the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70).

DesignBCS70 is a prospective birth cohort study of a population-representative sample.

SettingData collection was conducted in participants homes across Great Britain.

ParticipantsAll individuals born in one week in April 1970 and resident in the UK are eligible to take part, including those born outside the UK who subsequently immigrated. The study has more than 17,000 participants, of whom 8,581 responded at the last available sweep at age 46-48.

Main outcome measuresAverage nightly sleep duration at age 46-48, as assessed by five separate methods: self-report, inference from a sleep diary and three algorithms used to process accelerometry data collected using a thigh-worn activPAL 3 device.

ResultsAll seven measures of childhood mental ill-health were positively associated with abnormal self-reported sleep duration. Five were associated with abnormal diary-derived estimates and four were associated with abnormal estimates from an accelerometry-based algorithm. Strengths of associations vary. Adjusting for adult mental health symptoms partially attenuated the associations with self-reported sleep duration but not with the more objective estimates.

ConclusionsPoor mental health in childhood is associated with abnormal nightly sleep duration at age 46-48. Post-hoc analyses suggest that this association might not be entirely mediated by poor mental health in adulthood. Future research should attempt to replicate these results in diverse samples and assess whether stronger interventions in early-life mental health might have substantial and long-lasting positive impacts on sleep.

SummaryWhat is already known on this topic O_LIThe state of a persons mental health in their early life is associated with a range of adult health outcomes.
C_LIO_LIThere exists a bidirectional and multifaceted relationship between the state of a persons mental health and their sleep.
C_LIO_LIThe longitudinal association between early-life mental health and sleep in adulthood was not well understood.
C_LI

What this study adds O_LIOur study demonstrates that early-life mental health is associated with an abnormal average nightly sleep duration at age 46 in this sample.
C_LIO_LIAssociations between early-life mental health and abnormal average nightly sleep at age 46 were not fully mediated by adult mental health.

        <p class="abstract">Importance: Understanding the mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) improvement is a key challenge to determine effective personalized treatments. Objective: To perform a secondary analysis quantifying neural-to-symptom relationships in MDD as a function of antidepressant treatment. Design: Double blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: Multicenter. Participants: Patients with early onset recurrent depression from the public Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. Interventions: Either sertraline or placebo during 8 weeks (stage 1), and according to response a second line of treatment for 8 additional weeks (stage 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: To identify a data-driven pattern of symptom variations during these two stages, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the variations of individual items of four clinical scales measuring depression, anxiety, suicidal ideas and manic-like symptoms, resulting in a univariate measure of clinical improvement. We then investigated how initial clinical and neural factors predicted this measure during stage 1. To do so, we extracted resting-state global brain connectivity (GBC) at baseline at the individual level using a whole-brain functional network parcellation. In turn, we computed a linear model for each brain parcel with individual data-driven clinical improvement scores during stage 1 for each group. Results: 192 patients (127 women), age 37.7 years old (standard deviation: 13.5), were included. The first PC (PC1) capturing 20% of clinical variation was similar across treatment groups at stage 1 and stage 2, suggesting a reproducible pattern of symptom improvement. PC1 patients&#39; scores significantly differed according to treatment during stage 1, whereas no difference of response was evidenced between groups with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). Baseline GBC correlated to stage 1 PC1 scores in the sertraline, but not in the placebo group. Conclusions and Relevance: Using data-driven reduction of symptoms scales, we identified a common profile of symptom improvement across placebo and sertraline. However, the neural patterns of baseline that mapped onto symptom improvement distinguished between treatment and placebo. Our results underscore that mapping from data-driven symptom improvement onto neural circuits is vital to detect treatment-responsive neural profiles that may aid in optimal patient selection for future trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alterations in decision-making have been suggested to underlie different psychiatric illnesses, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. Studies report overlapping and divergent alterations in individuals diagnosed with these disorders, which have been linked to symptoms of the respective disorders. One symptom characterizing all these disorders is impaired decision-making. To facilitate early diagnosis and treatment among these disorders which may also show comorbidities among each other, it is crucial to disentangle alterations in decision-making that are unique to specific disorders, from those that occur across diagnostic boundaries. Recent developments in computational modelling have enabled a mechanistic deconstruction of decision-making processes, facilitating the identification of disorder specific and disorder general alterations. We, therefore, employed two computational modelling approaches on to a two-step Markov decision task in a transdiagnostic cohort combining individuals diagnosed with MDD (N=23), OCD (N=25), and schizophrenia (N=27) to identify disorder specific and disorder general decision-making alterations, and associations with symptoms. The results revealed overall reliance on model-free decision-making behavior across all participants. Additionally, schizophrenia patients showed the lowest learning rate in stage one and highest switching rate (lowest perseverance) compared to all other groups. All patient groups were more random in their response profiles than controls in stage two, with schizophrenia patients revealing highest levels of randomness, while OCD patients were additionally more random in stage one compared to controls and MDD patients. Importantly, the findings revealed a correlation between increased model-free behavior and elevated depressive symptoms, while more model-based choices were linked to lower levels of anhedonia across all patients. Consequently, this study shows noteworthy disorder general and disorder specific decision-making alterations in individuals diagnosed with MDD, OCD, and schizophrenia, suggesting that concurrent alterations and symptoms might potentially have common underlying behavioral mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mental health is in a state of crisis with demand for mental health services sig- nificantly surpassing available care. As such, building scalable and objective measurement tools for mental health evaluation is of primary concern. Given the usage of spoken language in diagnostics and treatment, it stands out as potential methodology. Here a model is built for mental health status evaluation using natu- ral language processing. Specifically, a RoBERTa-based model is fine-tuned on text from psychotherapy sessions to predict mental health status with prediction accuracy on par with clinical evaluations at 74%.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The psychosis spectrum encompasses a heterogeneous range of clinical conditions associated with abnormal brain development. The molecular and micro-architectural attributes that account for structural deviations from typical neurodevelopment are still unknown. Here, we aggregate magnetic resonance imaging data from 38,696 healthy controls and 1,256 psychosis-related cases, including first-degree relatives, psychotic experiences, first-episodes, and chronic conditions. Using normative modeling, we generated centile scores for cortical gray matter phenotypes, identifying deviations in regional volumes below the expected trajectory for all conditions. Additionally, we mapped 46 neurobiological features from healthy individuals (including neurotransmitters, cell types, layer thickness, microstructure, cortical expansion, and metabolism) to these centiles using a multivariate approach. Results revealed that neurobiological features were highly co-localized with centile deviations, where metabolism and neurotransmitter concentrations showed the most consistent spatial overlap with abnormal developmental trajectories. These findings shed light on the vulnerability factors that may underlie atypical brain maturation during different stages of psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Armed conflict has negative mental health impacts on internally displaced people and refugees, however, much less is known of its effects upon the mental health of displaced people and refugees with disabilities. We use Europe-wide data (N = 9679), collected via an internet health needs survey across April-July 2022, to examine the mental health impacts of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on the mental health of displaced people with disabilities during the first months of the war. Regression models separately examined associations between functional impairment (vision, walking, existing mental health conditions), access to healthcare, welfare payments, anxiety, and sleep quality, controlling for a number of sociodemographic variables including preferred language spoken at home, as an indicator of Russian or Ukrainian cultural identity. The presence of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, mobility and vision impairment were each associated with higher levels of anxiety and poorer sleep quality. The ability to access health services and social security payments was also associated with better sleep and lower levels of anxiety. Humanitarian and local authorities must ensure Ukrainian refugees and IDPs are reviewed for their mental health needs, with particular attention to those with known disabilities.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDiagnoses in psychiatric research can be derived from various sources. This study assesses the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.

MethodsThe study included 3,029 clinically ascertained participants with schizophrenia or psychotic disorders diagnosed by self-report and/or research interview and 1,453 UK Biobank participants with self-report and/or medical record diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder depressed-type (SA-D). We assessed positive predictive values (PPV) of self-reported clinical diagnoses against research interview and medical record diagnoses. We compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) and phenotypes across diagnostic groups, and compared the variance explained by schizophrenia PRS to samples in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC).

ResultsIn the clinically ascertained sample, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a research diagnosis of schizophrenia was 0.70, which increased to 0.81 when benchmarked against schizophrenia or SA-D. In UK Biobank, the PPV of self-reported schizophrenia to a medical record diagnosis was 0.74. Compared to self-report participants, those with a research diagnosis were younger and more likely to have a high school qualification (clinically ascertained sample) and those with a medical record diagnosis were less likely to be employed or have a high school qualification (UK Biobank). Schizophrenia PRS did not differ between participants that had a diagnosis from self-report, research diagnosis or medical record diagnosis. Polygenic liability r2, for all diagnosis definitions, fell within the distribution of PGC schizophrenia cohorts.

ConclusionsSelf-report measures of schizophrenia are justified in research to maximise sample size and representativeness, although within sample validation of diagnoses is recommended.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions with complex underlying neurobiology. Despite overlapping presentation and sex-biased prevalence, autism and ADHD are rarely studied together, and sex differences are often overlooked. Normative modelling provides a unified framework for studying age-specific and sex-specific divergences in neurodivergent brain development.

MethodsHere we use normative modelling and a large, multi-site neuroimaging dataset to characterise cortical anatomy associated with autism and ADHD, benchmarked against models of typical brain development based on a sample of over 75,000 individuals. We also examined sex and age differences, relationship with autistic traits, and explored the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD (autism&#43;ADHD).

ResultsWe observed robust neuroanatomical signatures of both autism and ADHD. Overall, autistic individuals showed greater cortical thickness and volume localised to the superior temporal cortex, whereas individuals with ADHD showed more global effects of cortical thickness increases but lower cortical volume and surface area across much of the cortex. The autism&#43;ADHD group displayed a unique pattern of widespread increases in cortical thickness, and certain decreases in surface area. We also found evidence that sex modulates the neuroanatomy of autism but not ADHD, and an age-by-diagnosis interaction for ADHD only.

ConclusionsThese results indicate distinct cortical differences in autism and ADHD that are differentially impacted by age, sex, and potentially unique patterns related to their co-occurrence.</p>
