While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined. MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk. FindingsRelative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 13{middle dot}77 (95% CI 8{middle dot}52-20{middle dot}91) when adjusted for age at birth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1{middle dot}88 [95% CI 0{middle dot}74-3{middle dot}82]). In full siblings, the relative recurrence risk for severe postpartum psychosis requiring inpatient diagnosis was even higher than the risk for inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (18{middle dot}13 [95% CI 11{middle dot}12-27{middle dot}57]). InterpretationIncreased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings is likely due to a combination of genetic factors and shared environment. The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.\nIntegrating Genome-wide information and Wearable Device Data to Explore the Link of Anxiety and Antidepressants with Heart Rate Variability\nAuthors: Friligkou, E.; Koller, D.; Pathak, G. A.; Miller, E. J.; Lampert, R.; Stein, M.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293170\nBackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03). ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.\nClassifying autism in a clinical population based on motion synchrony: a proof-of-concept study using real-life diagnostic interviews\nAuthors: Koehler, J. C.; Dong, M. S.; Song, D.-Y.; Bong, G.; Koutsouleris, N.; Yoo, H.; Falter-Wagner, C. M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293186\nPredictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.\nCharacterization of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia among women with homelessness\nAuthors: Menon, J.; Kantipudi, S. J.; Mani, A.; Radhakrishnan, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.23293378\nBackgroundStudies of schizophrenia and homelessness are often confounded by comorbid substance use. Women with schizophrenia and homelessness in India have very low rates of substance use and provide a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of illness from that of substance use. We examined the clinical characteristics of women with schizophrenia and homelessness and compared it to an age-matched group of women with schizophrenia living with their family. Methods36 women with schizophrenia and homelessness, and 32 women with schizophrenia who were illness living with family were evaluated for psychopathology using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/ Scale for assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) scales, cognitive difficulties using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)/Rowland Universal Dementia Scale (RUDAS), and Frontal Assessment Battery(FAB), disability using World Health Organization - Disability assessment Scale (WHO-DAS) and psychosocial factors using a semi-structured proforma. The groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square for continuous and categorical variables respectively. ResultsWomen with schizophrenia and homelessness were found to have significantly higher scores on measures of psychopathology, significantly lower cognitive functioning, and much higher disability, and were also on higher doses of antipsychotics. The mean scores on measures of psychopathology, cognition and disability for women with schizophrenia and homelessness differed by 2-3 standard deviations with the mean for women living with family (i.e. z scores) suggesting that they represented an extreme phenotype. Rates of past employment were higher among women with schizophrenia and homelessness. Hence these differences were not accounted for by premorbid functioning. ConclusionsThe study raises the possibility of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia with severe and persistent psychopathology non-responsive to dopamine blocking drugs, cognitive impairment, and disability, which needs further exploration.\nRacial/Ethnic Differences in COVID-19-Traumatic Symptoms, Sleep, Coping Outcomes in a Group of New-Yorkers\nAuthors: Blanc, J.; Seixas, A.; Small, S.; Auguste, E.; Briggs, A.; Antoine, Y. S.; Bubu, O. M.; Jean-Louis, G.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293452\nBackgroundLittle research has examined within/between group predictors and mediators of race/ethnic differences or disparities in mental and sleep health outcomes arising from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. ObjectivesThis study sought to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 experiences on trauma-related symptoms and sleep quality among a multiracial/ethnic sample in New York. MethodThis is a cross-sectional study conducted online among multiethnic adults (n=541) who experienced the pandemic in New York from September to November 2020. Comparisons of characteristics and mean scores by race/ethnicity status were conducted using one-way ANOVA and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Multilinear regression was used for associations between social determinants of health and/or SES, trauma-related symptoms, coping, and sleep. ResultsCompared to Whites [Mean (SD)= (24.1(7.6)] and other group [Mean (SD)=24.9(8.2), Blacks [Mean (SD)=(26.3(6.4)] and Hispanics [Mean(SD)=(27.2(8.2)] reported higher level of peritraumatic distress [df= 3; F=4273; p=0.005). The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms was 21.4%(n=113): [Whites=31(16.3%); Blacks=28(25.7%); Hispanics=24(25%); and other groups=30(22.4%); x2 =4.93; p=0.177]. This rate doubled [48.3%(257)] when it comes to the overall clinically significant depression level. Compared to all subcategories, [Blacks=52(47.7%); Hispanics =62(64.6%); other group=66(49.3%)], depression symptoms were lower among Whites [77(39.9%; x2 =15.71; p=0.001]. We found a prevalence of insufficient sleep \u003c6 hours of 41%(198): [Whites=69(39.4%); Blacks=43(41.7%); Hispanics=46(52.3%); other groups=40(34.2%); x2=12.21; p=0.057]. Several unique demographic predictors of PTSD emerged for distinct racial/ethnic groups. Among Blacks, sex [{beta} = -0.22; p \u003c .01] and employment [{beta} = -0.159; p \u003c .05] emerged as significant predictors for PTSD, but for no other racial/ethnic group. Interestingly, among Hispanics [{beta} = -0.144; p = .064] and Blacks [{beta} = -0.174; p = .0.076], coping strategies did not mitigate PTSD or depressive symptoms. ConclusionAs New York and the rest of the world are trying to bounce back from the COVID-19 consequences, mental health outcomes are devastating, particularly among historically marginalized communities. This study provides insight into the emergency for policymakers to invest in racial justice programs and provide free access to culturally responsive mental health care for the most vulnerable groups.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPostpartum psychosis, a mood disorder triggered by childbirth, is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. While it is evident that genetic factors play a crucial role in disorder risk, the exact extent of their importance is yet to be determined.

MethodsThis cohort study consisted of 1,633,535 birthing parents from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,489 (0{middle dot}15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first ever childbirth. We estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk.

The elevated risk in cousin pairs, lower than in full siblings, highlights genetic impact because shared environmental effects are assumed to be minimal among cousins. However, caution is needed in interpreting the risk among cousins due to wide confidence intervals. Overall, our study supports the role of genetics and shared environment in the risk of postpartum psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN.

ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03).

ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStudies of schizophrenia and homelessness are often confounded by comorbid substance use. Women with schizophrenia and homelessness in India have very low rates of substance use and provide a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of illness from that of substance use. We examined the clinical characteristics of women with schizophrenia and homelessness and compared it to an age-matched group of women with schizophrenia living with their family.

Methods36 women with schizophrenia and homelessness, and 32 women with schizophrenia who were illness living with family were evaluated for psychopathology using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/ Scale for assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) scales, cognitive difficulties using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)/Rowland Universal Dementia Scale (RUDAS), and Frontal Assessment Battery(FAB), disability using World Health Organization - Disability assessment Scale (WHO-DAS) and psychosocial factors using a semi-structured proforma. The groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square for continuous and categorical variables respectively.

ResultsWomen with schizophrenia and homelessness were found to have significantly higher scores on measures of psychopathology, significantly lower cognitive functioning, and much higher disability, and were also on higher doses of antipsychotics. The mean scores on measures of psychopathology, cognition and disability for women with schizophrenia and homelessness differed by 2-3 standard deviations with the mean for women living with family (i.e. z scores) suggesting that they represented an extreme phenotype. Rates of past employment were higher among women with schizophrenia and homelessness. Hence these differences were not accounted for by premorbid functioning.

ConclusionsThe study raises the possibility of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia with severe and persistent psychopathology non-responsive to dopamine blocking drugs, cognitive impairment, and disability, which needs further exploration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLittle research has examined within/between group predictors and mediators of race/ethnic differences or disparities in mental and sleep health outcomes arising from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectivesThis study sought to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 experiences on trauma-related symptoms and sleep quality among a multiracial/ethnic sample in New York.

MethodThis is a cross-sectional study conducted online among multiethnic adults (n=541) who experienced the pandemic in New York from September to November 2020. Comparisons of characteristics and mean scores by race/ethnicity status were conducted using one-way ANOVA and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Multilinear regression was used for associations between social determinants of health and/or SES, trauma-related symptoms, coping, and sleep.

ResultsCompared to Whites [Mean (SD)= (24.1(7.6)] and other group [Mean (SD)=24.9(8.2), Blacks [Mean (SD)=(26.3(6.4)] and Hispanics [Mean(SD)=(27.2(8.2)] reported higher level of peritraumatic distress [df= 3; F=4273; p=0.005). The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms was 21.4%(n=113): [Whites=31(16.3%); Blacks=28(25.7%); Hispanics=24(25%); and other groups=30(22.4%); x2 =4.93; p=0.177]. This rate doubled [48.3%(257)] when it comes to the overall clinically significant depression level. Compared to all subcategories, [Blacks=52(47.7%); Hispanics =62(64.6%); other group=66(49.3%)], depression symptoms were lower among Whites [77(39.9%; x2 =15.71; p=0.001]. We found a prevalence of insufficient sleep &lt;6 hours of 41%(198): [Whites=69(39.4%); Blacks=43(41.7%); Hispanics=46(52.3%); other groups=40(34.2%); x2=12.21; p=0.057]. Several unique demographic predictors of PTSD emerged for distinct racial/ethnic groups. Among Blacks, sex [{beta} = -0.22; p &lt; .01] and employment [{beta} = -0.159; p &lt; .05] emerged as significant predictors for PTSD, but for no other racial/ethnic group. Interestingly, among Hispanics [{beta} = -0.144; p = .064] and Blacks [{beta} = -0.174; p = .0.076], coping strategies did not mitigate PTSD or depressive symptoms.

ConclusionAs New York and the rest of the world are trying to bounce back from the COVID-19 consequences, mental health outcomes are devastating, particularly among historically marginalized communities. This study provides insight into the emergency for policymakers to invest in racial justice programs and provide free access to culturally responsive mental health care for the most vulnerable groups.</p>
