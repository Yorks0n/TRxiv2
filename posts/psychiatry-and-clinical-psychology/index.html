There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health. Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing. Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally. Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). - This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban. - There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model. - This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research. - This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.\nCo-design and evaluation of a youth-informed organisational tool to enhance trauma-informed practices in the UK public sector: a study protocol\nAuthors: Hugh-Jones, S.; Butcher, I.; Bhui, K.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299620\nIntroductionA trauma-informed approach (TIA) means working with awareness that peoples histories of trauma may shape the way the engage with a services, organisations or institutions. Young people with childhood adversities may be at risk of re-traumatisation by organisational practices in schools, universities, and by employers and health agencies when they seek support. There are limited evidence-based resources to help people working in diverse public sector to work with adolescents in trauma-informed ways and the needs of adolescents have not been central in their development. This study contributes to public sector capacity to work in trauma-informed ways with adolescents by co-designing and evaluating the implementation of a youth-informed organisational resource. Methods and analysisThis is an Accelerated Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) study followed by a pre-post evaluation. Public sector organisations or services, and adolescents connected with them, will collaboratively reflect on lived experience data assembled through creative arts practice, alongside data from epidemiological national datasets. These will present knowledge about the impact of adverse childhood experiences on adolescents mental health (Stage 1). Collaboratively, priorities (touch points) for organisational responses will be identified (stage 2), and a low-burden resource will be co-designed (stage 3), and offered for implementation in diverse settings (stage 4) and evaluated (stage 5). This will provide insights into what adolescents and public sector organisations in the UK want from a TIA resource, the experience of organisations in implementing this and recommendations for resource development and implementation. EthicsThe UK National Health Service Health Research Authority approved this study (23/WM/0105). Knowledge products will include website detailing the created resource and a youth-created film documenting the study process, the elements of the co-designed resource, and experiences of implementation. Dissemination will target academic, healthcare, education, social care, third-sector, local government settings via knowledge exchange events, accessible briefings and publication. Strengths and Limitations (five)O_LIThis multi-site study nested study in a larger national study draws on youth lived experience and survey data to inform the co-design of a resource to support diverse public sector settings to work in trauma-informed ways. C_LIO_LIWe plan to recruit diverse young people to work in partnership with the organisations through which they are recruited, so that youth voice informs the co-design process in all its aspects. Our study also aims to understand how to deliver co-production studies with young people in ways that are trauma-informed. C_LIO_LIUse of frameworks for experience-based co-design and implementation theory is a strength. C_LIO_LIImplementation plans and evaluation protocols will be co-designed with settings, improving the chances of acceptable and meaningful resource use and evaluation. C_LIO_LIA limitation is that the time for implementation is relatively short, and not formalised, relying on participants adopting the interventions in their work places; and evaluation stage is a simple real world pre-post assessment, not a trial.

Previous studies investigating the BBB in SSD focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, that cannot adequately assess BBB integrity. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) represents a sensitive method for investigating subtle barrier breakdown in vivo. So far, only one pilot study has investigated BBB breakdown in SSD with DCE-MRI, in a relatively small cohort. We hypothesized higher leakage in SSD compared to HC, indicative of a clinical sub-phenotype of SSD. MethodsForty-one people with SSD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the final analyses of the cross-sectional study. DCE-MRI, clinical characterization, cognitive assessments, blood and CSF analyses were conducted. The volume transfer constant Ktrans was calculated with pharmacokinetic modelling (Patlak method), to estimate the rate of contrast agent transfer between blood and the brains extravascular space. Ktrans maps were compared between the groups to detect group differences in BBB leakage. Within the SSD cohort, the association between leakage and clinical characteristics was investigated with linear regression analyses. ResultsGroup comparisons of Ktrans maps showed higher leakage in SSD compared to HC on a whole brain level. The effect was more pronounced in first episode compared to multiple episode psychosis. No association was detected between leakage and measures of cognition, psychopathology, peripheral inflammation and albumin CSF/serum ratio. DiscussionThis is the largest study to date investigating the BBB in SSD with DCE-MRI in a multimodal approach, allowing direct exploration of the BBB, compared to a HC group. The integrity of the BBB is crucial for maintaining the brains microenvironment, and its disruption could be associated with potential immune system abnormalities. The results of this study provide the first in vivo evidence of higher BBB leakage on a whole brain level compared to HC. The disruption of the BBB in SSD, as detected through DCE-MRI, may provide insights into the diseases mechanisms and potential for targeted treatments. Further research in this area may clarify specific biological disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.\nNeurometabolic dysfunction in psychosis observed with 7 T MRS\nAuthors: Schallmo, M.-P.; Demro, C.; Killebrew, K. W.; Olman, C. A.; Sponheim, S. R.; Marjanska, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.24300788\nAltered brain chemistry is thought to contribute to impairments in cognitive and perceptual functioning in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP). As heritable genetic factors shape the development of psychosis, these alterations in brain chemistry may extend to biological relatives of PwPP. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method for quantifying the concentration of various neurochemicals in the human brain. A number of MRS studies in different brain regions have been performed in PwPP, and to a lesser extent in relatives, but results have been largely mixed. There are a number of methodological issues that may have influenced previous findings. We show here that when such issues are addressed, MRS reveals a pattern of neurometabolic dysfunction in PwPP. We acquired MRS data at 7 tesla with an ultra-short echo time (TE = 8 ms) sequence in both occipital and prefrontal cortices from 43 healthy controls, 42 first-degree biological relatives, and 64 PwPP. We saw reduced levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the occipital lobe in PwPP and their relatives (versus controls), and lower N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in prefrontal cortex in PwPP versus controls. Surprisingly, we also saw markedly increased levels of glucose in both occipital and prefrontal cortices in PwPP. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that higher glucose levels were linked to higher psychiatric symptom levels and impairments in visual task performance. Together, our findings point to a disruption in neural metabolism across multiple brain areas in PwPP that is associated with impaired cognitive and perceptual functioning.\nA mobile app providing individually-tailored psychoeducation about sleep for older adults with chronic health conditions and low health literacy\nAuthors: Ownby, R. L.; Thomas-Purcell, K.; Purcell, D.; Caballero, J.; Tewary, S.; Davenport, R.; Simonson, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.24300726\nObjectiveThis paper reports the effect of a mobile app that provides tailored information about sleep to individuals aged 40 and older who have chronic health conditions and low health literacy. MethodsThe sleep module was a part of a multitopic app focused on chronic disease self-management. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sleep psychoeducation at reading levels equivalent to 3rd, 6th or 8th grade. The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which was completed at baseline, after the intervention, and again three months later. Outcomes were assessed using repeated measures mixed effects models. ResultsMost participants were Black, Indigenous, or Other Persons of Color (BIPOC; 87%); they had average reading level at the 7th grade. Health literacy, socioeconomic status, number of health conditions, and the interventions effect were related to the PSQI. The PSQI score significantly decreased over the course of the three study visits for all groups, consistent with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.40). No effect of treatment group was observed. ConclusionResults suggest that a brief tailored information intervention may be beneficial for individuals aged 40 and older who have low health literacy and chronic health conditions. Further development of the intervention may enhance its clinical effectiveness.

Research to date has focused on utilising qualitative and quantitative measures to understand possible mechanisms, and interventions for those who may have experienced ACEs. ObjectivesThis study aims to co-design a novel digital game, in collaboration with youth and adult stakeholders, to engage 12-25-year olds in learning about the impact of ACEs and how to protect and promote mental health following ACE exposure. Additionally, this project aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention. MethodsThis study will adopt Experience Based Co- Design methods with adolescents aged between 12 and 24 living in England, and will involve adult stakeholders working in the public sector. We will then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the co-designed game on young people, and test its cost-effectiveness. ConclusionThis project will enable an insight into the processes of co-designing a youth-informed public mental health game-based intervention and feasibility and acceptability of a serious game approach for adolescents aged between 12-24 years of age who may have experienced ACEs. Strengths and limitations of this study- Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has primarily focused on quantitative and qualitative data to explore possible resources for young people. This study describes a novel digital game study for young people who may have experienced adversities. - The data on adverse childhood experiences has primarily on focused on urban and rural areas; this study seeks to recruit young people from rural, urban and coastal regions across England - This study is restricted to England, and whilst it is hoped the findings will be applicable to the U.K and more globally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of working with young people only in England - This study is one of a few studies that has sought to involve young people through the co design of a resource for young people who may have experienced adversities from initial conception of the idea to implementation of the game.\nFunctional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens predicts clinical course in treated and non-responder adult ADHD\nAuthors: Zaher, A.; Leonards, J.; Reif, A.; Grimm, O.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300820\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that often persists into adulthood, contributing to a challenging trajectory characterised by increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Contrary to previous assumptions, the clinical course of ADHD in adulthood is characterised by dynamic changes influenced by stimulant treatment. To improve the precision of treatment, the identification of a predictive neuroimaging biomarker would be of great clinical importance. In this study, we explore the potential of seed-based functional connectivity (FC) as a predictive tool for assessing the clinical course of ADHD symptoms. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 54 adult ADHD patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 3 Tesla scanner. All patients received stimulant treatment during an initial run-in period. After an average of three years, only subjective responders continued treatment (n=34), while subjective non-responders discontinued medication (n=20). We reassessed patients after three years of treatment to 1) evaluate the prediction of individual outcome by baseline fMRI and 2) to investigate differences in prediction by baseline fMRI depending on long-term treatment vs. discontinuation. Our investigation focused on determining whether a relationship could be established between resting-state FC of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the trajectory of symptom development, as well as identifying possible differences in FC between individuals who had been on long-term stimulant treatment and those who had not used stimulants at the time of follow-up. In general, reduced FC between the NAc and the default mode network (DMN) was associated with initially higher symptom burden, whereas patterns of improvement correlated with reduced FC between the NAc and the salience network (SN). Comparatively, higher FC between the NAc and the SN was associated with better symptom outcomes in patients receiving long-term stimulant medication, whereas lower FC between the NAc and the SN was correlated with a more favourable prognosis in non-responders. Our prospective fMRI study suggests that functional connectivity between the dopaminergic reward circuitry and the SN, especially the insula, is predictive of better ADHD symptom outcomes. This work highlights the potential of dopaminergic functional connectivity as a prognostic factor in ADHD. While future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted, our study highlights the role of the NAc in the prognosis of ADHD.\nA multimodal neural signature of face processing in autism within the fusiform gyrus\nAuthors: Floris, D. L.; Llera, A.; Zanihi, M.; Jones, E. J. H.; Mason, L.; Haartsen, R.; Holz, N. E.; Mei, T. E.; Pretzsch, C. M.; Forde, N.; Hebling Vieira, B.; Elleaume, C.; Baumeister, S.; Dell Acqua, F.; Durston, S.; Banaschewski, T.; Ecker, C.; Holt, R.; Baron-Cohen, S.; Bourgeron, T.; Charman, T.; Loth, E.; Murphy, D. G. M.; Buitelaar, J. K.; Beckmann, C. F.; the EU-AIMS LEAP group, ; Langer, N.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.23300134\nBackgroundDifferences in face processing are commonly reported in case/control studies of autism. Their neural correlates have been explored extensively across single neuroimaging modalities within key regions of the face processing network, such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood how different variation(s) in brain anatomy and function combine to impact face processing and social functioning. Extracting the shared information across different modalities is essential to better delineate the complex relationship between brain structure and function, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying autism. MethodsHere, we leveraged data from the large multimodal EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) to study the cross-modal signature of face processing within the FFG across structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), task-fMRI (based on the Hariri emotional faces task) and electroencephalography (EEG; recorded when observing facial stimuli) in a sample of 99 autistic and 105 non-autistic individuals (NAI) aged 6-30 years. We combined two methodological innovations: (i) normative modelling was employed on each imaging modality separately to derive individual-level deviations from a predicted developmental trajectory and (ii) unimodal deviations were fused through Linked Independent Component (IC) Analysis to simultaneously decompose the imaging data into underlying modes that characterise multi-modal signatures across the cohort. Next, we tested whether ICs significantly differed between autistic and NAI and whether multimodal ICs would outperform unimodal ICs in discriminating autistic individuals from NAI using a support vector machine under 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we tested the association between multimodal ICs and cognitive, clinical measures of social or non-social functioning in autism using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). ResultsIn total, 50 independent components were derived. Among these one multimodal IC differed significantly between autistic and NAI (t=3.5, pFDR=0.03). This IC was mostly driven by bilateral rs-fMRI, bilateral structure, right task-fMRI, and left EEG loadings and implicated both face-selective and retinotopic regions of the FFG. Furthermore, multimodal ICs performed significantly better at differentiating autistic from NAI than unimodal ICs (p\u003c0.001). Finally, there was a significant multivariate association between multimodal ICs and a set of cognitive and clinical features associated with social functioning (r=0.65, pFDR=0.008); but not with non-social features. DiscussionThe FFG appears to be a central region differentially implicated in autistic and NAI across a range of inter-related imaging modalities and category-selective regions in both the left and right hemispheres. Elucidating more integrated, individual-level neural associations of core social functioning in autism will pave the way for further work on identifying more fine-grained stratification, mechanistic and prognostic biomarkers, and the development of more personalised support.\nMindfulness Coaching with Digital Lifestyle Monitoring Enhances Selective Attention in Medical Scientists\nAuthors: Jaiswal, S.; Nan, J.; Purpura, S. R.; Manchanda, J.; Garcia-pak, I.; Ramanathan, D.; Chuss, D.; Rana, D. T.; Beck, E.; Insel, P.; Chi, N.; Roth, D.; Patel, H.; Mishra, J.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300716\nMedical scientists have dual commitments to clinical care and research efforts. Such commitments can create hectic and stressful work schedules, which may impact on well-being and cognition. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mindfulness coaching plus wearable-based lifestyle monitoring can benefit such individuals. We conducted a waitlist-controlled intervention study (n=43) with M.D./Ph.D. preclinical or graduate students and post M.D./Ph.D. trainees/faculty. Assessments of quantitative outcomes included subjective measures of burnout, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, as well as objective cognitive assessments. The results showed no impacts on subjective measures. However, amongst objective cognitive measures, selective attention performance was significantly improved following the intervention (bias corrected effect size, Hedges g = 1.13, p=0.005). Extent of improvement in selective attention correlated with suppression of visual alpha oscillations - a neural marker for distractibility - measured using electroencephalography (EEG) (r=-0.32, p\u003c0.05). Qualitative feedback showed that after receiving the intervention, participants in both groups equally rated the overall experience as \"very good\" (3.70 {+/-}0.98 out 5). They also appreciated that the intervention emphasized healthy lifestyle behaviors, and contributed to mindfulness, compassion, and a sense of community. A majority (57%) of the participants reported that they expect to change their well-being related behaviors because of the intervention. Overall, this study suggests the utility of mindfulness coaching to improve selective attention skills in medical scientists and that more needs to be done to enhance subjective well-being in such individuals.\nA wearable, steerable, transcranial Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound system\nAuthors: Bawiec, C.

B.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300243\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSTranscranial Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) offers unique opportunities for precisely neuromodulating small and/or deep targets within the human brain, which may be useful for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. This paper presents a novel ultrasound system that delivers focused ultrasound through the forehead to anterior brain targets and evaluates its safety and usability in a volunteer study. MethodsThe ultrasound system and workflow are described, including neuronavigation, LIFU planning, and ultrasound delivery components. Its capabilities are analyzed through simulations and experiments to establish its safe steering range. A cohort of 20 healthy volunteers received a LIFU protocol aimed at the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), using imaging and questionnaires to screen for adverse effects. ResultsSimulations and hydrophone readings agreed with less than 5% error, and the safe steering range was found to encompass a 1.8cm x 2.5cm x 2cm volume. There were no adverse effects evident on qualitative assessments, nor any signs of damage in susceptibility-weighted imaging scans. All participants tolerated the treatment well, and the users found the interface effective as the system was capable of accurately targeting the amPFC in all participants. A post hoc analysis showed that \"virtual fitting\" could aid in steering the beams around subjects sinuses. ConclusionsThe presented system was successfully used to safely deliver LIFU through the forehead to the amPFC in all volunteers, and was well-tolerated. With the capabilities validated here and positive results of the study, this technology appears well-suited to explore LIFUs efficacy in clinical neuromodulation contexts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionAdverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health in adolescence. There are critical gaps in understanding how and why ACEs are experienced by particular groups of young people and what factors contribute to risk and resilience. This research aims to: a) understand the lived experiences by which ACEs in diverse young people unfold to affect their mental health and b) utilise and understand how novel creative and participatory arts approaches can contribute new knowledge about ACEs to inform future interventions for adolescent mental health.

Methods and analysisAn interdisciplinary collaboration, this utilises a blended mixed-methods approach as a triangulation between qualitative research methods, arts-based practice research and a participatory-community-research model. Framework-analysis is utilised as is appropriate to the complexities of data collection in interdisciplinary studies, working across teams, combining analysis of themes across a group (ACE-affected adolescents) with consideration of individual participants through interviews and creative media. This study will recruit 100 young people aged between 10-24 in England in; Cornwall, Kent, Leeds, London and Oxfordshire. This study is part of a larger project by the same authors, investigating adolescent mental health. In this discovery phase, creative practices are being used in conjunction with qualitative methods of data analysis to enable us to elicit, examine lived experience and youth voice as core features of enquiry. This facilitates understanding of the role of creative practices in helping young people share the events in their lives that they feel have been significant in shaping their views of themselves, of others and of their current mental health and wellbeing.

Ethics and disseminationThis study is sponsored by the University of Oxford. Ethical approval obtained from institution (R71941/RE001) and NHS Health Research Authority committees. (23/WM/0105) The outputs from this study will be shared, locally, nationally and globally.

Strengths and Limitations (five)- This study aims to understand the lived experiences of adolescents aged between 10-24 regarding adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
- This study is recruiting adolescents from a range of communities and geographic localities in England, including, rural and urban.
- There is a plethora of research examining the association between ACEs and mental health outcomes, but a paucity of research has employed a blended mixed method approach utilising qualitive research methods, arts-based practice and a participatory community research model.
- This study will purposively endeavour to ensure each adolescents voice is heard and the study will engage with those individuals who may otherwise not be able to participate in research.
- This study is focused on recruiting in England and thus the findings it is hoped will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in the devolved nations but the authors recognise that adolescents in the devolved nations may have experienced different ACEs to those adolescents in this study.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionA trauma-informed approach (TIA) means working with awareness that peoples histories of trauma may shape the way the engage with a services, organisations or institutions. Young people with childhood adversities may be at risk of re-traumatisation by organisational practices in schools, universities, and by employers and health agencies when they seek support. There are limited evidence-based resources to help people working in diverse public sector to work with adolescents in trauma-informed ways and the needs of adolescents have not been central in their development. This study contributes to public sector capacity to work in trauma-informed ways with adolescents by co-designing and evaluating the implementation of a youth-informed organisational resource.

Methods and analysisThis is an Accelerated Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) study followed by a pre-post evaluation. Public sector organisations or services, and adolescents connected with them, will collaboratively reflect on lived experience data assembled through creative arts practice, alongside data from epidemiological national datasets. These will present knowledge about the impact of adverse childhood experiences on adolescents mental health (Stage 1). Collaboratively, priorities (touch points) for organisational responses will be identified (stage 2), and a low-burden resource will be co-designed (stage 3), and offered for implementation in diverse settings (stage 4) and evaluated (stage 5). This will provide insights into what adolescents and public sector organisations in the UK want from a TIA resource, the experience of organisations in implementing this and recommendations for resource development and implementation.

EthicsThe UK National Health Service Health Research Authority approved this study (23/WM/0105). Knowledge products will include website detailing the created resource and a youth-created film documenting the study process, the elements of the co-designed resource, and experiences of implementation. Dissemination will target academic, healthcare, education, social care, third-sector, local government settings via knowledge exchange events, accessible briefings and publication.

Strengths and Limitations (five)O_LIThis multi-site study nested study in a larger national study draws on youth lived experience and survey data to inform the co-design of a resource to support diverse public sector settings to work in trauma-informed ways.
C_LIO_LIWe plan to recruit diverse young people to work in partnership with the organisations through which they are recruited, so that youth voice informs the co-design process in all its aspects. Our study also aims to understand how to deliver co-production studies with young people in ways that are trauma-informed.
C_LIO_LIUse of frameworks for experience-based co-design and implementation theory is a strength.
C_LIO_LIImplementation plans and evaluation protocols will be co-designed with settings, improving the chances of acceptable and meaningful resource use and evaluation.
C_LIO_LIA limitation is that the time for implementation is relatively short, and not formalised, relying on participants adopting the interventions in their work places; and evaluation stage is a simple real world pre-post assessment, not a trial.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is growing evidence for inflammatory mechanisms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) that have been associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Previous studies investigating the BBB in SSD focused on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers, that cannot adequately assess BBB integrity. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) represents a sensitive method for investigating subtle barrier breakdown in vivo. So far, only one pilot study has investigated BBB breakdown in SSD with DCE-MRI, in a relatively small cohort. We hypothesized higher leakage in SSD compared to HC, indicative of a clinical sub-phenotype of SSD.

MethodsForty-one people with SSD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included in the final analyses of the cross-sectional study. DCE-MRI, clinical characterization, cognitive assessments, blood and CSF analyses were conducted. The volume transfer constant Ktrans was calculated with pharmacokinetic modelling (Patlak method), to estimate the rate of contrast agent transfer between blood and the brains extravascular space. Ktrans maps were compared between the groups to detect group differences in BBB leakage. Within the SSD cohort, the association between leakage and clinical characteristics was investigated with linear regression analyses.

ResultsGroup comparisons of Ktrans maps showed higher leakage in SSD compared to HC on a whole brain level. The effect was more pronounced in first episode compared to multiple episode psychosis. No association was detected between leakage and measures of cognition, psychopathology, peripheral inflammation and albumin CSF/serum ratio.

DiscussionThis is the largest study to date investigating the BBB in SSD with DCE-MRI in a multimodal approach, allowing direct exploration of the BBB, compared to a HC group. The integrity of the BBB is crucial for maintaining the brains microenvironment, and its disruption could be associated with potential immune system abnormalities. The results of this study provide the first in vivo evidence of higher BBB leakage on a whole brain level compared to HC. The disruption of the BBB in SSD, as detected through DCE-MRI, may provide insights into the diseases mechanisms and potential for targeted treatments. Further research in this area may clarify specific biological disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Altered brain chemistry is thought to contribute to impairments in cognitive and perceptual functioning in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP). As heritable genetic factors shape the development of psychosis, these alterations in brain chemistry may extend to biological relatives of PwPP. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive method for quantifying the concentration of various neurochemicals in the human brain. A number of MRS studies in different brain regions have been performed in PwPP, and to a lesser extent in relatives, but results have been largely mixed. There are a number of methodological issues that may have influenced previous findings. We show here that when such issues are addressed, MRS reveals a pattern of neurometabolic dysfunction in PwPP. We acquired MRS data at 7 tesla with an ultra-short echo time (TE = 8 ms) sequence in both occipital and prefrontal cortices from 43 healthy controls, 42 first-degree biological relatives, and 64 PwPP. We saw reduced levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the occipital lobe in PwPP and their relatives (versus controls), and lower N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in prefrontal cortex in PwPP versus controls. Surprisingly, we also saw markedly increased levels of glucose in both occipital and prefrontal cortices in PwPP. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that higher glucose levels were linked to higher psychiatric symptom levels and impairments in visual task performance. Together, our findings point to a disruption in neural metabolism across multiple brain areas in PwPP that is associated with impaired cognitive and perceptual functioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThis paper reports the effect of a mobile app that provides tailored information about sleep to individuals aged 40 and older who have chronic health conditions and low health literacy.

MethodsThe sleep module was a part of a multitopic app focused on chronic disease self-management. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sleep psychoeducation at reading levels equivalent to 3rd, 6th or 8th grade. The primary outcome measure was the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which was completed at baseline, after the intervention, and again three months later. Outcomes were assessed using repeated measures mixed effects models.

ResultsMost participants were Black, Indigenous, or Other Persons of Color (BIPOC; 87%); they had average reading level at the 7th grade. Health literacy, socioeconomic status, number of health conditions, and the interventions effect were related to the PSQI. The PSQI score significantly decreased over the course of the three study visits for all groups, consistent with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.40). No effect of treatment group was observed.

ConclusionResults suggest that a brief tailored information intervention may be beneficial for individuals aged 40 and older who have low health literacy and chronic health conditions. Further development of the intervention may enhance its clinical effectiveness.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has focused on utilising qualitative and quantitative measures to understand possible mechanisms, and interventions for those who may have experienced ACEs.

ObjectivesThis study aims to co-design a novel digital game, in collaboration with youth and adult stakeholders, to engage 12-25-year olds in learning about the impact of ACEs and how to protect and promote mental health following ACE exposure. Additionally, this project aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention.

MethodsThis study will adopt Experience Based Co- Design methods with adolescents aged between 12 and 24 living in England, and will involve adult stakeholders working in the public sector. We will then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the co-designed game on young people, and test its cost-effectiveness.

ConclusionThis project will enable an insight into the processes of co-designing a youth-informed public mental health game-based intervention and feasibility and acceptability of a serious game approach for adolescents aged between 12-24 years of age who may have experienced ACEs.

Strengths and limitations of this study- Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer mental health outcomes later in life. Research to date has primarily focused on quantitative and qualitative data to explore possible resources for young people. This study describes a novel digital game study for young people who may have experienced adversities.
- The data on adverse childhood experiences has primarily on focused on urban and rural areas; this study seeks to recruit young people from rural, urban and coastal regions across England
- This study is restricted to England, and whilst it is hoped the findings will be applicable to the U.K and more globally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of working with young people only in England
- This study is one of a few studies that has sought to involve young people through the co design of a resource for young people who may have experienced adversities from initial conception of the idea to implementation of the game.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that often persists into adulthood, contributing to a challenging trajectory characterised by increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Contrary to previous assumptions, the clinical course of ADHD in adulthood is characterised by dynamic changes influenced by stimulant treatment. To improve the precision of treatment, the identification of a predictive neuroimaging biomarker would be of great clinical importance.

In this study, we explore the potential of seed-based functional connectivity (FC) as a predictive tool for assessing the clinical course of ADHD symptoms. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of 54 adult ADHD patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 3 Tesla scanner. All patients received stimulant treatment during an initial run-in period. After an average of three years, only subjective responders continued treatment (n=34), while subjective non-responders discontinued medication (n=20). We reassessed patients after three years of treatment to 1) evaluate the prediction of individual outcome by baseline fMRI and 2) to investigate differences in prediction by baseline fMRI depending on long-term treatment vs. discontinuation.

Our investigation focused on determining whether a relationship could be established between resting-state FC of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the trajectory of symptom development, as well as identifying possible differences in FC between individuals who had been on long-term stimulant treatment and those who had not used stimulants at the time of follow-up.

In general, reduced FC between the NAc and the default mode network (DMN) was associated with initially higher symptom burden, whereas patterns of improvement correlated with reduced FC between the NAc and the salience network (SN).

Comparatively, higher FC between the NAc and the SN was associated with better symptom outcomes in patients receiving long-term stimulant medication, whereas lower FC between the NAc and the SN was correlated with a more favourable prognosis in non-responders.

Our prospective fMRI study suggests that functional connectivity between the dopaminergic reward circuitry and the SN, especially the insula, is predictive of better ADHD symptom outcomes. This work highlights the potential of dopaminergic functional connectivity as a prognostic factor in ADHD. While future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted, our study highlights the role of the NAc in the prognosis of ADHD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDifferences in face processing are commonly reported in case/control studies of autism. Their neural correlates have been explored extensively across single neuroimaging modalities within key regions of the face processing network, such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood how different variation(s) in brain anatomy and function combine to impact face processing and social functioning. Extracting the shared information across different modalities is essential to better delineate the complex relationship between brain structure and function, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying autism.

MethodsHere, we leveraged data from the large multimodal EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) to study the cross-modal signature of face processing within the FFG across structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), task-fMRI (based on the Hariri emotional faces task) and electroencephalography (EEG; recorded when observing facial stimuli) in a sample of 99 autistic and 105 non-autistic individuals (NAI) aged 6-30 years. We combined two methodological innovations: (i) normative modelling was employed on each imaging modality separately to derive individual-level deviations from a predicted developmental trajectory and (ii) unimodal deviations were fused through Linked Independent Component (IC) Analysis to simultaneously decompose the imaging data into underlying modes that characterise multi-modal signatures across the cohort. Next, we tested whether ICs significantly differed between autistic and NAI and whether multimodal ICs would outperform unimodal ICs in discriminating autistic individuals from NAI using a support vector machine under 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we tested the association between multimodal ICs and cognitive, clinical measures of social or non-social functioning in autism using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).

ResultsIn total, 50 independent components were derived. Among these one multimodal IC differed significantly between autistic and NAI (t=3.5, pFDR=0.03). This IC was mostly driven by bilateral rs-fMRI, bilateral structure, right task-fMRI, and left EEG loadings and implicated both face-selective and retinotopic regions of the FFG. Furthermore, multimodal ICs performed significantly better at differentiating autistic from NAI than unimodal ICs (p&lt;0.001). Finally, there was a significant multivariate association between multimodal ICs and a set of cognitive and clinical features associated with social functioning (r=0.65, pFDR=0.008); but not with non-social features.

DiscussionThe FFG appears to be a central region differentially implicated in autistic and NAI across a range of inter-related imaging modalities and category-selective regions in both the left and right hemispheres. Elucidating more integrated, individual-level neural associations of core social functioning in autism will pave the way for further work on identifying more fine-grained stratification, mechanistic and prognostic biomarkers, and the development of more personalised support.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medical scientists have dual commitments to clinical care and research efforts. Such commitments can create hectic and stressful work schedules, which may impact on well-being and cognition. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mindfulness coaching plus wearable-based lifestyle monitoring can benefit such individuals. We conducted a waitlist-controlled intervention study (n=43) with M.D./Ph.D. preclinical or graduate students and post M.D./Ph.D. trainees/faculty. Assessments of quantitative outcomes included subjective measures of burnout, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, as well as objective cognitive assessments. The results showed no impacts on subjective measures. However, amongst objective cognitive measures, selective attention performance was significantly improved following the intervention (bias corrected effect size, Hedges g = 1.13, p=0.005). Extent of improvement in selective attention correlated with suppression of visual alpha oscillations - a neural marker for distractibility - measured using electroencephalography (EEG) (r=-0.32, p&lt;0.05). Qualitative feedback showed that after receiving the intervention, participants in both groups equally rated the overall experience as &#34;very good&#34; (3.70 {&#43;/-}0.98 out 5). They also appreciated that the intervention emphasized healthy lifestyle behaviors, and contributed to mindfulness, compassion, and a sense of community. A majority (57%) of the participants reported that they expect to change their well-being related behaviors because of the intervention. Overall, this study suggests the utility of mindfulness coaching to improve selective attention skills in medical scientists and that more needs to be done to enhance subjective well-being in such individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSObjectivesC_ST_ABSTranscranial Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) offers unique opportunities for precisely neuromodulating small and/or deep targets within the human brain, which may be useful for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders. This paper presents a novel ultrasound system that delivers focused ultrasound through the forehead to anterior brain targets and evaluates its safety and usability in a volunteer study.

MethodsThe ultrasound system and workflow are described, including neuronavigation, LIFU planning, and ultrasound delivery components. Its capabilities are analyzed through simulations and experiments to establish its safe steering range. A cohort of 20 healthy volunteers received a LIFU protocol aimed at the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), using imaging and questionnaires to screen for adverse effects.

ResultsSimulations and hydrophone readings agreed with less than 5% error, and the safe steering range was found to encompass a 1.8cm x 2.5cm x 2cm volume. There were no adverse effects evident on qualitative assessments, nor any signs of damage in susceptibility-weighted imaging scans. All participants tolerated the treatment well, and the users found the interface effective as the system was capable of accurately targeting the amPFC in all participants. A post hoc analysis showed that &#34;virtual fitting&#34; could aid in steering the beams around subjects sinuses.

ConclusionsThe presented system was successfully used to safely deliver LIFU through the forehead to the amPFC in all volunteers, and was well-tolerated. With the capabilities validated here and positive results of the study, this technology appears well-suited to explore LIFUs efficacy in clinical neuromodulation contexts.</p>
