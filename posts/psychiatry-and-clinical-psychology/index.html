However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nThe genetic architecture of human cerebellar morphology supports a key role for the cerebellum in recent human evolution and psychopathology\nAuthors: Moberget, T.; van der Meer, D.; Bahrami, S.; Roelfs, D.; Frei, O.; Kaufmann, T.; Fernandez Rodriguez-Cabello, S.; Kim, M.; Wolfers, T.; Diedrichsen, J.; Smeland, O. B.; Shadrin, A.; Dale, A.; Andreassen, O. A.; Westlye, L. T.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.10.23285704\nThe functional domain of the cerebellum has expanded beyond motor control to also include cognitive and affective functions. In line with this notion, cerebellar volume has increased over recent primate evolution, and cerebellar alterations have been linked to heritable mental disorders. To map the genetic architecture of human cerebellar morphology, we here studied a large imaging genetics sample from the UK Biobank (n discovery = 27,302; n replication: 11,264) with state-of-the art neuroimaging and biostatistics tools. Multivariate GWAS (MOSTest) on empirically derived regional cerebellar MRI features yielded 351 significant genetic loci (228 novel, 94% replicated). Candidate SNPs showed significant positive enrichment for relatively recent genetic mutations over the last 300k years (i.e., coinciding with the emergence of Homo sapiens), while gene level analyses revealed enrichment for genes associated with human-specific evolution over the last [~]6-8 million years. Finally, we observed genetic overlap with major mental disorders, reinforcing the notion of cerebellar involvement in psychopathology. TeaserGenome-wide analysis of cerebellar morphology reveals links to recent human evolution and psychopathology\nAge-associated alterations in thalamocortical structural connectivity in psychosis-spectrum youths\nAuthors: Lewis, L.; Corcoran, M.; Cho, K. I. K.; Kwak, Y.; Hayes, R.; Jalbrzikowski, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.23292446\nObjectivePsychotic symptoms typically emerge in adolescence when connections between the thalamus and cortex are still maturing. The extent to which thalamocortical connectivity differences observed in psychosis occur as a function of age-associated alterations is not fully understood. MethodsWe analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging data from 1254 participants 8-23 years old (typically developing youth: N=626, psychosis-spectrum youth: N=329, other psychopathology: N=299) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Using deterministic fiber tractography, we modeled eight tracts between the thalamus and cortical regions of interest. We extracted diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures. We used generalized additive models to determine group and age-associated differences in thalamocortical connectivity. ResultsCompared to typically developing youth and youth with other psychopathologies, psychosis-spectrum youth exhibited thalamocortical reductions in DSI global fractional anisotropy (p-values range=3.0x10-6-0.05) and DTI fractional anisotropy (p-values range=4.2x10-4-0.03). Compared to typically developing youth, psychosis-spectrum youth exhibited shallower thalamus-prefrontal age-associated increases in DSI global fractional anisotropy and DTI fractional anisotropy during middle childhood, and steeper thalamus-prefrontal age-associated increases in those measures during adolescence. Both typically developing youth and youth with other psychopathologies exhibited decreases in mean and radial diffusivity in thalamus-frontal tracts during adolescence; psychosis-spectrum youth failed to show these age-related decreases. ConclusionOur findings suggest group differences and altered age-related patterns of thalamocortical white matter connectivity in psychosis-spectrum youth. Consistent alterations present as early as middle childhood and altered age-associated patterns during adolescence and young adulthood may contribute to the disruptions in thalamocortical connectivity observed in adults with psychosis.\nBrain-heart interactions in novice meditation practitioners during breath focus and an arithmetic task\nAuthors: Soriano, J. R.; Rodriguez-Larios, J.; Varon, C.; Castellanos, N.; Alaerts, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.23292291\nObjectivesThe study of neural and visceral oscillatory activities reveals that both subsystems and their interactions influence human cognition. In particular, cardiac and neural changes during self-regulation processes can be studied through a comparison of stress-inducing procedures and meditation practices. MethodsIn this study, we investigate the characteristic profiles of neural-cardiac interactions during a stress-inducing arithmetic task and a breath focus meditation period in a sample of 21 young participants (10 women, age range 20-29) with no prior experience in meditation practices. Using recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), we assessed instantaneous cross-frequency relationships between the alpha neural band and heart rate in both conditions. ResultsOur results indicate significant heart rate and alpha frequency decelerations during breath focus compared to the stress-inducing task. Regarding alpha: heart rate cross-frequency relationships, the stress-inducing arithmetic task exhibited ratios of smaller magnitude than the breath focus task, including a higher incidence of the specific 8:1 cross-frequency relationship, compared to the breath-focus task, proposed to enable cross-frequency coupling among neural and cardiac rhythms during mild cognitive stress. The change in cross-frequency relationships were mostly driven by changes in heart rate frequency between the two tasks, as indicated through surrogate data analyses. ConclusionsOur results provide novel evidence that stress responses and changes during meditation practices can be better characterized by integrating physiological markers and, more crucially, their interactions. Together, this physiologically comprehensive approach can aid in guiding interventions such as physiology modulation protocols (biofeedback and neurofeedback) for emotion and stress-regulation.\nDissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on depression symptom dimensions in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Costello, H.; Schrag, A.; Howard, R.; Roiser, J.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.23292073\nBackgroundDepression in Parkinsons disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known. AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses. MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated \"motivation\" and \"depression\" dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures. ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The functional domain of the cerebellum has expanded beyond motor control to also include cognitive and affective functions. In line with this notion, cerebellar volume has increased over recent primate evolution, and cerebellar alterations have been linked to heritable mental disorders. To map the genetic architecture of human cerebellar morphology, we here studied a large imaging genetics sample from the UK Biobank (n discovery = 27,302; n replication: 11,264) with state-of-the art neuroimaging and biostatistics tools. Multivariate GWAS (MOSTest) on empirically derived regional cerebellar MRI features yielded 351 significant genetic loci (228 novel, 94% replicated). Candidate SNPs showed significant positive enrichment for relatively recent genetic mutations over the last 300k years (i.e., coinciding with the emergence of Homo sapiens), while gene level analyses revealed enrichment for genes associated with human-specific evolution over the last [~]6-8 million years. Finally, we observed genetic overlap with major mental disorders, reinforcing the notion of cerebellar involvement in psychopathology.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivePsychotic symptoms typically emerge in adolescence when connections between the thalamus and cortex are still maturing. The extent to which thalamocortical connectivity differences observed in psychosis occur as a function of age-associated alterations is not fully understood.

MethodsWe analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging data from 1254 participants 8-23 years old (typically developing youth: N=626, psychosis-spectrum youth: N=329, other psychopathology: N=299) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Using deterministic fiber tractography, we modeled eight tracts between the thalamus and cortical regions of interest. We extracted diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures. We used generalized additive models to determine group and age-associated differences in thalamocortical connectivity.

ResultsCompared to typically developing youth and youth with other psychopathologies, psychosis-spectrum youth exhibited thalamocortical reductions in DSI global fractional anisotropy (p-values range=3.0x10-6-0.05) and DTI fractional anisotropy (p-values range=4.2x10-4-0.03). Compared to typically developing youth, psychosis-spectrum youth exhibited shallower thalamus-prefrontal age-associated increases in DSI global fractional anisotropy and DTI fractional anisotropy during middle childhood, and steeper thalamus-prefrontal age-associated increases in those measures during adolescence. Both typically developing youth and youth with other psychopathologies exhibited decreases in mean and radial diffusivity in thalamus-frontal tracts during adolescence; psychosis-spectrum youth failed to show these age-related decreases.

ConclusionOur findings suggest group differences and altered age-related patterns of thalamocortical white matter connectivity in psychosis-spectrum youth. Consistent alterations present as early as middle childhood and altered age-associated patterns during adolescence and young adulthood may contribute to the disruptions in thalamocortical connectivity observed in adults with psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesThe study of neural and visceral oscillatory activities reveals that both subsystems and their interactions influence human cognition. In particular, cardiac and neural changes during self-regulation processes can be studied through a comparison of stress-inducing procedures and meditation practices.

MethodsIn this study, we investigate the characteristic profiles of neural-cardiac interactions during a stress-inducing arithmetic task and a breath focus meditation period in a sample of 21 young participants (10 women, age range 20-29) with no prior experience in meditation practices. Using recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), we assessed instantaneous cross-frequency relationships between the alpha neural band and heart rate in both conditions.

ResultsOur results indicate significant heart rate and alpha frequency decelerations during breath focus compared to the stress-inducing task. Regarding alpha: heart rate cross-frequency relationships, the stress-inducing arithmetic task exhibited ratios of smaller magnitude than the breath focus task, including a higher incidence of the specific 8:1 cross-frequency relationship, compared to the breath-focus task, proposed to enable cross-frequency coupling among neural and cardiac rhythms during mild cognitive stress. The change in cross-frequency relationships were mostly driven by changes in heart rate frequency between the two tasks, as indicated through surrogate data analyses.

ConclusionsOur results provide novel evidence that stress responses and changes during meditation practices can be better characterized by integrating physiological markers and, more crucially, their interactions. Together, this physiologically comprehensive approach can aid in guiding interventions such as physiology modulation protocols (biofeedback and neurofeedback) for emotion and stress-regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDepression in Parkinsons disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known.

AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses.

MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated &#34;motivation&#34; and &#34;depression&#34; dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging.

ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures.

ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.</p>
