In the current study, we evaluated the complexity and functional connectivity (FC) of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) in pre-adolescents with ADHD for pathology-relevant networks. We leveraged data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The final study sample included 63 children with ADHD and 92 healthy control children matched on age, sex, and pubertal development status. For selected regions in relevant networks, ANCOVA compared multiscale entropy (MSE) and FC between the groups. Finally, differences in the association between MSE and FC were evaluated. We found significantly reduced MSE along with increased FC within the FPN of pre-adolescents with ADHD compared to matched healthy controls. Significant partial correlations between MSE and FC emerged in fewer regions in the participants with ADHD than in the controls. The observation of reduced entropy is consistent with existing literature using rsfMRI and other neuroimaging modalities. The current findings of complexity and FC in ADHD support hypotheses of altered function of inhibitory control networks in ADHD.\nModeling brain sex in the limbic system as phenotype for female-prevalent mental disorders\nAuthors: Matte Bon, G.; Kraft, D.; Comasco, E.; Derntl, B.; Kaufmann, T.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23294165\nBackground: Profound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics. Methods: We here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample. Results: Limbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model. Conclusions: Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.\nMDMA Assisted Psychotherapy Decreases PTSD Symptoms, Dissociation, Functional Disability, and Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Green, W. M.; Raut, S. B.; James, F. L. J.; Benedek, D. M.; Ursano, R. J.; Johnson, L. R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23293955\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.\nEffect of Daytime Nap on Attention, Working Memory, and Recognition Memory\nAuthors: Zare, S.; Dortaj, F.; Setareh, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294066\nDaytime napping has gained attention for its potential to enhance cognitive functions. While the positive impact of nocturnal sleep on cognitive functions is widely acknowledged, limited research has focused on the effects of daytime naps. In this study, we investigated the influence of a 30-minute afternoon nap on cognitive functions in healthy adults. Ten participants (4 females) were involved in both nap and non-nap (control) conditions. Participants were randomly selected from the sleep department of Zare Hospital. During the nap condition, participants engaged in a 30-minute nap at approximately 14:00. Cognitive assessments were performed 30 minutes after the nap to reduce the effects of sleep inertia. Three days after nap condition, cognitive evaluations were conducted again at approximately 15:00, in the non-nap condition. Working memory, evaluated using the Backward Digit Span Task using a paired sample t-test, exhibited significant improvement during napping (p = 0.0164, d = 0.459), highlighting its practical significance. Attention, assessed with the Stroop test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significant differences between nap and non-nap conditions, emphasizing nappings role in sustaining attention and alertness. Recognition memory, gauged through the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, revealed superior performance in the nap condition, particularly in False Alarm scores. Despite limitations such as sample size and nap monitoring, our study contributes valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of daytime napping. By refining our understanding of nappings effects, tailored interventions can be developed, promoting cognitive health and performance enhancement across various contexts.

While treatable, substantial diagnostic overlap exists among the externalizing disorders, complicating intervention planning. Thus, early adolescence is a period of considerable interest in understanding which factors predict the onset of externalizing disorders and disambiguating those that may differentially predict the development of ADD versus (vs) ODD and CD. Materials and Methods: Here, we analyzed 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors collected from children age 9-10 yrs and their parents in the ABCD cohort spanning demographics; developmental and medical history; physiologic function; academic performance; social, physical and cultural environment; activities of everyday life, substance use and cortical and subcortical brain structure, volumetrics, connectivity and function to predict the future onset of ADHD, ODD and CD at 2-year follow-up. We used deep learning optimized with an innovative AI algorithm that jointly optimizes model training and performs automated feature selection to construct prospective, individual-level predictions of illness onset in this high-dimension data. Additional experiments furnished predictive models of all prevailing cases at 11-12 yrs and examined relative predictive performance when candidate predictors were restricted to only neural metrics derived from MRI. Results: Multimodal models achieved strong, consistent performance with ~86-97% accuracy, 0.919-0.996 AUROC and ~82-97% precision and recall in testing in held-out, unseen data. In neural-only models, predictive performance dropped substantially but nonetheless accuracy and AUROC of ~80% were achieved. Parent aggressive and externalizing traits uniquely differentiated the onset of ODD while structural MRI metrics in the limbic system specifically predicted the onset of CD. Psychosocial measures of sleep disorders, parent mental health and behavioral traits and school performance proved valuable across all disorders but cognitive and non-neural physiologic metrics were never selected. In neural-only models, structural and functional MRI metrics in subcortical regions and cortical-subcortical connectivity were emphasized over task fMRI or diffusion measures. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between accuracy and final predictor importance. Conclusions: Deep learning optimized with AI can generate highly accurate individual-level predictions of the onset of early adolescent externalizing disorders using multimodal features. Analysis of 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors highlighted psychosocial predictors related to sleep disorders, school performance and parent mental health and behavioral traits over other feature types. While externalizing disorders are frequently co-morbid in adolescents, certain predictors appeared specific to the onset of ODD or CD vs ADHD with structural MRI metrics in the limbic system offering particular promise in identifying children at risk for the onset of CD, a highly disabling disorder. The strong observed correlation between predictive accuracy and final predictor importance suggests that principled, data-driven searches for impactful predictors may facilitate the construction of robust, individual-level models in high-dimension data. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning study to predict the onset of all three major adolescent externalizing disorders with the same design and participant cohort to enable direct comparisons, analyze \u003e200 multimodal features and include as many types of neuroimaging metrics. Future work to test our observations in external validation data will help further test the generalizability of these findings.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Profound sex differences exist in the prevalence and clinical manifestation of several mental disorders, suggesting that sex-specific brain phenotypes may play key roles. Previous research used machine learning models to classify sex from imaging data of the whole brain and studied the association of class probabilities with mental health, potentially overlooking regional specific characteristics. Methods: We here investigated if a regionally constrained model of brain volumetric imaging data may provide estimates that are more sensitive to mental health than whole brain-based estimates. Given its known role in emotional processing and mood disorders, we focused on the limbic system. Using two different cohorts of healthy subjects, the Human Connectome Project and the Queensland Twin IMaging, we investigated sex differences and heritability of brain volumes of limbic structures compared to non-limbic structures. We applied regionally constrained machine learning models for brain sex classification based solely on limbic or non-limbic features and compared the results with a whole brain model. To investigate the biological underpinnings of such models, we assessed the heritability of the obtained estimates, and we investigated the association with major depression diagnosis in an independent clinical sample. Results: Limbic structures show greater sex differences and are more heritable compared to non-limbic structures. Consequently, machine learning models performed well at classifying sex based solely on limbic structures and achieved performance as high as those on non-limbic or whole brain data, despite the much smaller amount of features in the limbic system. The resulting class probabilities were heritable, suggesting potentially meaningful underlying biological information. Applied to an independent population with major depressive disorder, we found that depression is significantly associated with male-female class probabilities, with largest effects obtained using the limbic model. Conclusions: Overall, our results highlight the potential utility of regionally constrained models of brain sex to better understand the link between sex differences in the brain and mental disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Daytime napping has gained attention for its potential to enhance cognitive functions. While the positive impact of nocturnal sleep on cognitive functions is widely acknowledged, limited research has focused on the effects of daytime naps. In this study, we investigated the influence of a 30-minute afternoon nap on cognitive functions in healthy adults.

Ten participants (4 females) were involved in both nap and non-nap (control) conditions. Participants were randomly selected from the sleep department of Zare Hospital. During the nap condition, participants engaged in a 30-minute nap at approximately 14:00. Cognitive assessments were performed 30 minutes after the nap to reduce the effects of sleep inertia. Three days after nap condition, cognitive evaluations were conducted again at approximately 15:00, in the non-nap condition.

Working memory, evaluated using the Backward Digit Span Task using a paired sample t-test, exhibited significant improvement during napping (p = 0.0164, d = 0.459), highlighting its practical significance. Attention, assessed with the Stroop test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significant differences between nap and non-nap conditions, emphasizing nappings role in sustaining attention and alertness. Recognition memory, gauged through the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, revealed superior performance in the nap condition, particularly in False Alarm scores.

Despite limitations such as sample size and nap monitoring, our study contributes valuable insights into the cognitive benefits of daytime napping. By refining our understanding of nappings effects, tailored interventions can be developed, promoting cognitive health and performance enhancement across various contexts.

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: The externalizing disorders of ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) exhibit a strong uptick in incidence in late childhood to become some of the most common mental health conditions in adolescence and strong predictors of adult psychopathology. While treatable, substantial diagnostic overlap exists among the externalizing disorders, complicating intervention planning. Thus, early adolescence is a period of considerable interest in understanding which factors predict the onset of externalizing disorders and disambiguating those that may differentially predict the development of ADD versus (vs) ODD and CD. Materials and Methods: Here, we analyzed 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors collected from children age 9-10 yrs and their parents in the ABCD cohort spanning demographics; developmental and medical history; physiologic function; academic performance; social, physical and cultural environment; activities of everyday life, substance use and cortical and subcortical brain structure, volumetrics, connectivity and function to predict the future onset of ADHD, ODD and CD at 2-year follow-up. We used deep learning optimized with an innovative AI algorithm that jointly optimizes model training and performs automated feature selection to construct prospective, individual-level predictions of illness onset in this high-dimension data. Additional experiments furnished predictive models of all prevailing cases at 11-12 yrs and examined relative predictive performance when candidate predictors were restricted to only neural metrics derived from MRI. Results: Multimodal models achieved strong, consistent performance with ~86-97% accuracy, 0.919-0.996 AUROC and ~82-97% precision and recall in testing in held-out, unseen data. In neural-only models, predictive performance dropped substantially but nonetheless accuracy and AUROC of ~80% were achieved. Parent aggressive and externalizing traits uniquely differentiated the onset of ODD while structural MRI metrics in the limbic system specifically predicted the onset of CD. Psychosocial measures of sleep disorders, parent mental health and behavioral traits and school performance proved valuable across all disorders but cognitive and non-neural physiologic metrics were never selected. In neural-only models, structural and functional MRI metrics in subcortical regions and cortical-subcortical connectivity were emphasized over task fMRI or diffusion measures. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between accuracy and final predictor importance. Conclusions: Deep learning optimized with AI can generate highly accurate individual-level predictions of the onset of early adolescent externalizing disorders using multimodal features. Analysis of 5,777 multimodal candidate predictors highlighted psychosocial predictors related to sleep disorders, school performance and parent mental health and behavioral traits over other feature types. While externalizing disorders are frequently co-morbid in adolescents, certain predictors appeared specific to the onset of ODD or CD vs ADHD with structural MRI metrics in the limbic system offering particular promise in identifying children at risk for the onset of CD, a highly disabling disorder. The strong observed correlation between predictive accuracy and final predictor importance suggests that principled, data-driven searches for impactful predictors may facilitate the construction of robust, individual-level models in high-dimension data. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning study to predict the onset of all three major adolescent externalizing disorders with the same design and participant cohort to enable direct comparisons, analyze &gt;200 multimodal features and include as many types of neuroimaging metrics. Future work to test our observations in external validation data will help further test the generalizability of these findings.</p>
