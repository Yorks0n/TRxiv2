B.; James, F. L. J.; Benedek, D. M.; Ursano, R. J.; Johnson, L. R.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.23293955\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) causes broad impairments affecting quality of life. However, despite current treatment many people with PTSD do not fully recover. MDMA assisted psychotherapy has emerged as a new therapy for PTSD and its comorbidities. We aimed to analyse the current evidence for MDMA assisted psychotherapy in PTSD and associated quality of life, and physiological effects, by conducting a systematic review and metanalysis of randomised controlled trials. ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and Cochrane Library database were searched from inception to July 2022. We included both published and unpublished randomized control trials comparing MDMA assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) with control. Meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures was performed using Review-Manager software. Effect sizes were calculated using Standardised Mean Difference for CAPS scores and Mean Difference for secondary measures. MDMA-AP significantly improves dissociation, depression, and functional impairment, compared to controls, but not sleep quality. This data supports the use of MDMA-AP for PTSD with an improvement found in PTSD core symptoms and quality of life measures. While these findings are limited by small samples sizes in currently available clinical trials, this study provides empirical evidence to support development of MDMA-AP in PTSD.\nCo-existence of negative and positive associations between cognition and intergenerational psychiatric symptoms reveal necessity of socioeconomic and clinical enrichment\nAuthors: Pines, A.; Tozzi, L.; Bertrand, C.; Keller, A. S.; Zhang, X.; Whitfield-Gabrieli, S.; Hastie, T.; Larsen, B.; Leikauf, J.; Williams, L. M.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.23294743\nBackgroundMental illnesses are a leading cause of disability globally. Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children. MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level. ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children. DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.\nRecapturing the Initial Clinical Benefit of TMS in a Major Depressive Episode: a Retrospective Analysis in a Veteran Cohort\nAuthors: Laufer, J.; Olmsted, A.; Sampair, I.; Madore, M.; Yoon, J.; Hack, L. M.; Keller, C. J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295376\nBackground: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now widely accepted as an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated acute TMS courses can recapture the antidepressant effects of the initial acute course is still an open question, especially in the Veteran population. We present here a retrospective analysis of a specialty clinic within the Veteran Affairs Hospital System to help address this question. Aims: Following an acute treatment course of TMS, we sought to determine the treatment response of a subsequent TMS course. We hypothesized that those who responded to an initial acute TMS course would respond in a similar manner to a subsequent treatment course. Methods: 116 cases referred for evaluation for TMS between September 2017 to April 2021 were reviewed. 63 Veterans completed at least one acute course of TMS and 12 completed at least two courses and met inclusion criteria for this review. Symptoms were evaluated via self-reported scales at baseline and weekly throughout treatment. Clinical response to subsequent treatment (\u003e50% symptom reduction as measured by the PHQ-9) was compared to initial treatment response. Results: Of the initial treatment responders (n = 6), all six responded to a second acute course, with an 85.3% symptom reduction. Of the initial treatment non-responders (n = 6), three responded to a second acute course. Exploratory regression analysis predicted change in depression symptoms (PHQ-9) during a second TMS course using initial treatment response, time into treatment, and baseline symptom severity. Together, these factors explained 72% of the variance. No adverse events were reported in those who completed a second course, and the Veterans tolerated the treatment well. Conclusions: Our findings support the growing understanding that a second acute TMS treatment course for treatment-resistant depression is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in initial responders and some non-responders. Despite multiple confounders in a naturalistic setting, robust initial treatment response was sustained in a second acute course. Low power limits generalizability, and larger powered, prospective studies are needed.\nDiscovery of 95 PTSD loci provides insight into genetic architecture and neurobiology of trauma and stress-related disorders\nAuthors: Nievergelt, C. M.; Maihofer, A. X.; The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for PTSD, ; Stein, M. B.; Ressler, K. J.; Koenen, K. C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294915\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 novel). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (e.g., GRIA1, GRM8, CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance, and transcription factors (e.g., FOXP2, EFNA5, DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (e.g., PCLO, NCAM1, PDE4B), and endocrine or immune regulators (e.g., ESR1, TRAF3, TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear, and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.\nPsychometric properties of the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) in Colombians with university education\nAuthors: Sanabria-Mazo, J. P.; Gomez-Acosta, A.; Annicchiarico-Lobo, J.; Luciano, J. V.; Sanz, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.23295052\nThe Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) is an ultra-brief self-report measure to assess perceived psychological stress. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the PSS-4 in Colombia. A total of 1911 adult participants with university education completed the PSS-4. Characteristics of the items and the subscales were explored. Dimensionality was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), incorporating an examination of invariance (configural, metric, scalar, and strict) across socio-demographic characteristics. Construct validity (convergent and discriminant), reliability indices, know-groups, and predictive validity were also computed. The CFA showed adequate fit indices for the two-factor model (hopelessness and coping), being invariant across gender, income level, age, and work status. Internal consistency was adequate for the PSS-4 ( = .73,{omega} = .72,{lambda} 2 = .74). Significant positive correlations of the PSS-4 were identified with depression (r = .59) and anxiety (r = .55), as well as significant negative with post-traumatic growth (r = -.37) and resilience (r = -.47). The PSS-4 showed adequate capacity to predict potential depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as protective factors such as resilience and posttraumatic growth. Higher scores on the PSS-4 were observed among young people, as well as among people with lower incomes and those unemployed. These findings suggest that the PSS-4 can be a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological stress in Colombians with university education.\nEffect of lifetime exposure to depression on brain structure and function in the UK Biobank\nAuthors: Wang, X.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Kasper, J.; Eickhoff, S.; Patil, K. R.; Dukart, J.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.23294887\nBackgroundDepression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort. MethodsWe included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume. ResultsAcross all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations. ConclusionLifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMental illnesses are a leading cause of disability globally. Across 17 psychiatric disorders, functional disability is often in part caused by cognitive impairments. However, cognitive heterogeneity in mental health is poorly understood, particularly in children.

MethodsWe used generalized additive models (GAMs) to reconcile discrepant reports of cognitive impairment across classes of psychiatric symptoms in 4,782 children and their parents. Specifically, we derive relationships between cognition and psychopathology across different ranges and classes of symptom burdens. We additionally evaluate generalizability across sex-assigned-at-birth (SAAB) and federal poverty status. Finally, we incorporate a measure of scholastic performance as a real-world measure of functional ability. Associations were tested at the 99% confidence level.

ResultsWe demonstrate that the previously-reported, weak, negative, and linear relationship between general cognition and general psychopathology consists of several stronger but opposed relationships. Externalizing symptoms are negatively associated with cognition, but internalizing symptoms are positively associated with cognition at low symptom burdens. This phenomenon holds across parental and child symptoms. Finally, we provide evidence that, compared to laboratory measures of cognition, school grades are more accurate and generalizable indicators of psychopathological burden in children.

DiscussionThe most common approach to quantifying the relationship between cognition and psychopathology systematically underestimates the strength and complexity of this relationship. Grades may represent a more accurate and generalizable marker of mental illness. Developmental studies incorporating clinical enrichment, parental mental health, and socioeconomically diverse samples may provide deeper and more generalizable insight into neurocognitive impairment and psychopathology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is now widely accepted as an effective non-pharmacologic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated acute TMS courses can recapture the antidepressant effects of the initial acute course is still an open question, especially in the Veteran population. We present here a retrospective analysis of a specialty clinic within the Veteran Affairs Hospital System to help address this question. Aims: Following an acute treatment course of TMS, we sought to determine the treatment response of a subsequent TMS course. We hypothesized that those who responded to an initial acute TMS course would respond in a similar manner to a subsequent treatment course. Methods: 116 cases referred for evaluation for TMS between September 2017 to April 2021 were reviewed. 63 Veterans completed at least one acute course of TMS and 12 completed at least two courses and met inclusion criteria for this review. Symptoms were evaluated via self-reported scales at baseline and weekly throughout treatment. Clinical response to subsequent treatment (&gt;50% symptom reduction as measured by the PHQ-9) was compared to initial treatment response. Results: Of the initial treatment responders (n = 6), all six responded to a second acute course, with an 85.3% symptom reduction. Of the initial treatment non-responders (n = 6), three responded to a second acute course. Exploratory regression analysis predicted change in depression symptoms (PHQ-9) during a second TMS course using initial treatment response, time into treatment, and baseline symptom severity. Together, these factors explained 72% of the variance. No adverse events were reported in those who completed a second course, and the Veterans tolerated the treatment well. Conclusions: Our findings support the growing understanding that a second acute TMS treatment course for treatment-resistant depression is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in initial responders and some non-responders. Despite multiple confounders in a naturalistic setting, robust initial treatment response was sustained in a second acute course. Low power limits generalizability, and larger powered, prospective studies are needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 novel). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (e.g., GRIA1, GRM8, CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance, and transcription factors (e.g., FOXP2, EFNA5, DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (e.g., PCLO, NCAM1, PDE4B), and endocrine or immune regulators (e.g., ESR1, TRAF3, TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear, and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) is an ultra-brief self-report measure to assess perceived psychological stress. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the PSS-4 in Colombia. A total of 1911 adult participants with university education completed the PSS-4. Characteristics of the items and the subscales were explored. Dimensionality was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), incorporating an examination of invariance (configural, metric, scalar, and strict) across socio-demographic characteristics. Construct validity (convergent and discriminant), reliability indices, know-groups, and predictive validity were also computed. The CFA showed adequate fit indices for the two-factor model (hopelessness and coping), being invariant across gender, income level, age, and work status. Internal consistency was adequate for the PSS-4 ( = .73,{omega} = .72,{lambda} 2 = .74). Significant positive correlations of the PSS-4 were identified with depression (r = .59) and anxiety (r = .55), as well as significant negative with post-traumatic growth (r = -.37) and resilience (r = -.47). The PSS-4 showed adequate capacity to predict potential depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as protective factors such as resilience and posttraumatic growth. Higher scores on the PSS-4 were observed among young people, as well as among people with lower incomes and those unemployed. These findings suggest that the PSS-4 can be a reliable and valid tool for assessing psychological stress in Colombians with university education.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDepression is a common mental health condition in the general population. Whereas various neuroimaging studies have reported altered activity and structural impairments in depression, several recent meta-analyses only found small or inconsistent effects of depression. Different operational inclusion criteria and processing methodologies may contribute to these discrepancies. We addressed these issues by systematically testing for the effects of different criteria of lifetime exposure to depression on functional and structural neuroimaging measures in the UK biobank cohort.

MethodsWe included 36,359 participants (20,794 lifetime depression and 15,565 healthy individuals) from the UK biobank. Six increasingly conservative groups of lifetime depression were defined based on the six available depression criteria from meeting only one to more restrictive meeting all six criteria. We tested the effect of these definitions on voxel-wise measures of local functional activity, global connectivity and gray matter volume.

ResultsAcross all depression definitions, individuals with lifetime depression displayed regionally consistent decreases in local functional activity alterations in sensorimotor cortex but not in global connectivity and gray matter volume alterations. More restrictive definitions and antidepressant usage resulted in most pronounced alterations.

ConclusionLifetime exposure to depression is associated with robust functional changes with more restrictive criteria revealing more pronounced alterations. Different inclusion criteria of depression may strongly contribute to the substantial variation of imaging findings reported in the literature.</p>
