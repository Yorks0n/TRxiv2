This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing. ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission. DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

E.; Hayes, R.; Corcoran, M.; Sheth, K. N.; Arnold, T. C.; Stein, J.; Glahn, D. C.; Jalbrzikowski, M.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.24300892\nBackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people. MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches. ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume. Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness. ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.\nLarge-Scale Mendelian Randomization Study Reveals Circulating Blood-based Proteomic Biomarkers for Psychopathology and Cognitive Task Performance\nAuthors: Bhattacharyya, U.; John, J.; Lam, M.; Fisher, J.; Sun, B.; Baird, D.; Chen, C.-Y.; Lencz, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301455\nBackground: Research on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance. Methods: We utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes. Results: MR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance. Conclusions: Identification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.\nA large-scale online survey of patients and the general public: Preferring safe and noninvasive neuromodulation for mental health\nAuthors: Atkinson-Clement, C.; Junor, A.; Kaiser, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.24301043\nWhile neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation. HighlightsO_LIFocused ultrasound is the preferred intervention for brain and mental health conditions C_LIO_LIThe preference of techniques was consistent between healthy participants and patients suffering from brain or mental health conditions. C_LIO_LIGetting more information about different neuromodulation techniques reduced confusion and increased feelings of being excited, optimistic, and comfortable with these techniques C_LIO_LIThe ranking of preference is linked with the perceived safety but not with perceived efficiency of techniques indicating safety as more important criterion C_LI\nPre-event psychiatric states predict trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAuthors: Nakai, F.; Kubo, T.; Oka, T.; Kobayashi, N.; Tanichi, M.; Murakami, M.; Hamamura, T.; Honjo, M.; Miyake, Y.; Ide, K.; Cortese, A.; Nagamine, M.; Chiba, T.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.23300571\nRecent time-dependent analyses of stress-related disorders have identified heterogeneity of trajectories and their modifying factors. While psychiatric patients are vulnerable to stress events, it is unclear how psychiatric conditions in the general population modulate subsequent stress responses. Using our longitudinal online survey from before the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic follow-ups (n = 3815 Japanese adults), here we identified four trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a latent growth mixture model; resilient, chronic, mild chronic, and early response. The depression/anxiety were identified as specific risk factors for the early-response trajectory. In contrast, general psychiatric burden and social withdrawal were identified as common risk/protective factors. Further, we estimated \"baseline\" PTSS to determine the predictability of the PTSS prognosis from pre-pandemic states. The chronic group showed significantly higher baseline PTSS scores than the mild-chronic and early-response groups, both of which were significantly higher than the resilient group. We concluded that prior psychiatric conditions significantly affect the PTSS trajectory. These results suggest that prior psychiatric conditions may be considered for the prevention and treatment of maladaptive stress responses.\nThe interplay between insomnia and Alzheimer Disease across three main brain networks\nAuthors: Elberse, J. D.; Saberi, A.; Ahmadi, R.; Changizi, M.; Bi, H.; Hoffstaedter, F.; Mander, B. A.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.24301427\nBackground: Insomnia is prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Methods: We selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC) , and functional connectivity (FC). We tested the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index across groups. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression for each network. Finally, we correlated brain abnormalities with cognitive scores. Results: Insomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. In the CN and MCI groups, insomnia symptoms were characterized by patterns of within-network hyperconnectivity, while in the AD group, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was observed. FC alterations within and between DMN and CEN hubs were associated with reduced MMSE scores in each of the groups. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN for AD individuals. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affect the intrinsic functional organization of the three networks along the AD trajectory. Patients with AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.\nEffects of Diazepam on Hippocampal Blood Flow in People at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis\nAuthors: Livingston, N. R.; Kiemes, A.; Devenyi, G. A.; Knight, S.; Lukow, P. B.; Jelen, L.; Reilly, T.; Dima, A.; Nettis, M. A.; Casetta, C.; Agyekum, T.; Zelaya, F.; Spencer, T.; De Micheli, A.; Fusar-Poli, P.; Grace, A. A.; Williams, S. C. R.; McGuire, P.; Egerton, A.; Chakravarty, M. M.; Modinos, G.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.23299658\nBackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals. MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield. ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 24.1[{+/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{+/-}SD] age: 26.5[{+/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR\u003c0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR\u003c0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR\u003c0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225). ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.\nProteomic Insights into Biology of Bipolar Disorder: Implications for Health Complexity and Mortality\nAuthors: Ziani, P. R.; de Bastiani, M. A.; Alves, P. P.; da Rosa, P. H.; Schons, T.; Mezzomo, G.; Scotton, E.; Kapczinski, F.; Rosa, A. R.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301415\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating condition associated with a high prevalence of medical comorbidities and premature mortality. This is the first study to explore, through high-throughput-omics combined with bioinformatics, molecular signatures, pathways, and main medical diseases related to different stages of BD. Blood samples from BD patients (n=10) classified into high (BD+) or poor functioning (BD-), based on functional and cognitive status, and healthy controls (n=5) were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Bioinformatics was performed to detect biological processes, pathways, and diseases related to BD. Eight proteins exclusively characterized the molecular profile of patients with BD+ compared to HC, while 26 altered proteins were observed in the BD-group. These altered proteins were mainly enriched in biological processes related to lipid metabolism, complement system and coagulation cascade, and cardiovascular diseases; all these changes were more prominent in the BD-group. These findings may represent systemic alterations that occur with the progression of the illness and a possible link between BD and medical comorbidities. Such comprehensive understanding provides valuable insights for targeted interventions, addressing mental and physical health aspects in subjects with BD.\nContingency-based flexibility mechanisms through a reinforcement learning model in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\nAuthors: Rodriguez-Herrera, R.; Leon, J. J.; Fernandez-Martin, P.; Sanchez-Kuhn, A.; Soto-Ontoso, M.; Pascasio, L. A.; Martinez-Sanchez, P.; Flores, P.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301365\nAbtractThe probabilistic reversal learning paradigm is one of the most used to assess cognitive flexibility during a contingency-based learning process. Lack of cognitive flexibility is related to the symptomatology that characterizes disorders such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) could be a specific predictor of performance in contingency-based cognitive flexibility. However, the mechanisms underlying learning and flexibility in an environment of uncertainty with OCD or ADHD adults have not been widely explored. Computational modelling may be helpful to separate components of the behavioural processes and identify the source of the disorders. In the present study, we aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying contingency-based cognitive flexibility in a sample of the impulsive-compulsive spectrum and healthy controls, and explore the rsFC between the frontoparietal networks (FPN) regions as a possible neuromarker. 148 Spanish-speaking participants (43 patients with OCD, 53 with ADHD, and 52 healthy controls) completed a probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT). Previously, we obtained a record of FNP rsFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, we applied the reinforcement learning model in combination with Bayesian GLM. We found that groups showed an optimal performance in the acquisition phase of the PRLT and higher performance of HC compared to the diagnostic groups in the reversal block, although performance is still optimal in all groups. Likewise, we found that the parameters studied (reinforcement learning rate, punishment learning rate and inverse temperature) predict task performance differently by phase and group. Regarding FNP rsFC, we found that rsFC between left posterior parietal cortex (lpPC) and right posterior parietal cortex (rpPC) seems to credibly predict performance in the acquisition block in the healthy controls. These findings suggest that reducing the uncertainty between action-outcome may help to improve the adaptation of ADHD and OCD patients to changing environments. Thus, understanding sensitivity to punishment or reinforcement and its influence on the decision-making may be important for designing case-specific interventions. According to our data, rsFC between lpPC and rpPC could be important for optimal learning of our task.\nMapping resources available for early identification and recovery-oriented intervention for people with psychosis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\nAuthors: Tsehay, M.; Kelkile, T. S.; Fekadu, W.; Cohen, A.; Misganaw, E.; Hanlon, C.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301385\nBackgroundThere is a pressing need to reduce the long duration of untreated illness and improve care and outcomes for people with psychosis in Ethiopia. This study aimed to map community resources that have the potential to be leveraged to achieve earlier and more recovery-oriented interventions for people with psychosis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. MethodA strength-based resource mapping exercise was undertaken in two sub-cities, covering an estimated population of half a million people. We identified the types of resources to be mapped, based on their importance for multi-sectoral care in mental health: healthcare facilities, religious organisations, traditional and faith healers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and social/community organisations. The lead investigator traversed the study sites to gather information on community resources, recorded the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the resources, and consulted with key informants. The information obtained was complemented by a participatory Theory of Change workshop attended by 30 stakeholders. ResultsWe identified 124 health facilities, of which only 16 health centres and nine hospitals currently provide mental health services. We identified three registered traditional healers, 38 religious organisations, 104 non-governmental organisations, and other charitable/community-based organisations. In addition, three health facilities, six holy water religious healing sites, and four traditional healers were identified as out-of-site resources that were popular and frequently visited by people living in the sub-cities. The two sub-cities also had six feeding centres each providing meals for 1000 people in need. There were extensive networks of social organisations and community-based associations. Existing care pathways are complex but commonly include traditional and religious healing sites as places of first contact. ConclusionsWe identified important available resources that provide a wealth of opportunities for improving the early identification and outcomes of people with psychosis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionN,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a naturally occurring psychedelic tryptamine contained in the indigenous ayahuasca brew has shown antidepressant effects. This Phase 2a clinical trial investigates for the first time the efficacy of isolated DMT in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

MethodsSix TRD patients participated in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation study, receiving a lower (15 mg) and then a higher (60 mg) dose of vaporized DMT in a single-day session. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) up to one-month post-dosing.

ResultsSignificant reductions in MADRS and PHQ-9 scores were noted from Day 1 to M1. The mean MADRS score variation from baseline to D7 was -22 points and -17 points at M1. PHQ-9 scores also showed significant decreases, mirroring the MADRS results. By D7, 83.33% of patients responded to treatment, with 66.67% achieving remission. At M1, 66.67% maintained response, and 50% maintained remission.

DiscussionThe rapid onset and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized DMT align with the paradigm of rapid-acting antidepressants to be used in the scope of interventional psychiatry. The non-invasive route and short-acting nature of DMT offer practical advantages, potentially enhancing accessibility to psychedelic treatments.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPortable low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems represent a promising alternative to traditional high-field-strength systems with the potential to make MR technology available at scale in low-resource settings. However, lower image quality and resolution may limit the research and clinical potential of these devices. We tested two super-resolution methods to enhance image quality in a low-field MR system and compared their correspondence with images acquired from a high-field system in a sample of young people.

MethodsT1- and T2-weighted structural MR images were obtained from a low-field (64mT) Hyperfine and high-field (3T) Siemens system in N = 70 individuals (mean age=20.39 years, range 9-26 years). We tested two super-resolution approaches to improve image correspondence between images acquired at high- and low-field: 1) processing via a convolutional neural network ( SynthSR), and 2) multi-orientation image averaging. We extracted brain region volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area estimates. We used Pearson correlations to test the correspondence between these measures, and Steiger Z tests to compare the difference in correspondence between standard imaging and super-resolution approaches.

ResultsSingle pairs of T1- and T2-weighted images acquired at low field showed high correspondence to high-field-strength images for estimates of total intracranial volume, surface area cortical volume, subcortical volume, and total brain volume (r range=0.60-0.88). Correspondence was lower for cerebral white matter volume (r=0.32, p=.007, q=.009) and non-significant for mean cortical thickness (r=-0.05, p=.664, q =.664). Processing images with SynthSR yielded significant improvements in correspondence for total brain volume, white matter volume, total surface area, subcortical volume, cortical volume, and total intracranial volume (r range=0.85-0.97), with the exception of global mean cortical thickness (r=0.14). An alternative multi-orientation image averaging approach improved correspondence for cerebral white matter and total brain volume.

Processing with SynthSR also significantly improved correspondence across widespread regions for estimates of cortical volume, surface area and subcortical volume, as well as within isolated prefrontal and temporal regions for estimates of cortical thickness.

ConclusionsApplying super-resolution approaches to low-field imaging improves regional brain volume and surface area accuracy in young people. Finer-scale brain measurements, such as cortical thickness, remain challenging with the limited resolution of low-field systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Research on peripheral (e.g., blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness has typically been low-throughput in terms of both the number of subjects and the range of assays performed. Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance. Methods: We utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes. Results: MR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance. Conclusions: Identification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. The findings also indicate substantial evidence for the pleiotropic effects of many proteins across different phenotypes, shedding light on the shared etiology among psychiatric conditions and cognitive ability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While neurotechnology provides opportunities for novel mental health interventions, preferences of patients and the general public, and the reasons for their choices are still unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale online survey with 785 participants, half of them suffering from psychiatric and/or neurological conditions. We asked about techniques ranging from invasive (pharmaceutical drugs and brain implants) to noninvasive approaches (ultrasound, magnetic, or electric stimulation). First, participants had a low level of prior knowledge but were interested and excited about these opportunities. Second, both patients and the general population preferred focused ultrasound stimulation (first choice) while drugs and implants were ranked 3rd and 5th out of five, respectively. Finally, that preference was mainly driven by whether they perceived a technology as safe, rather than as effective. Overall, this survey identifies safety as main criterion for interventions and shows a preference for novel noninvasive approaches such as focused ultrasound neuromodulation.

HighlightsO_LIFocused ultrasound is the preferred intervention for brain and mental health conditions
C_LIO_LIThe preference of techniques was consistent between healthy participants and patients suffering from brain or mental health conditions.
C_LIO_LIGetting more information about different neuromodulation techniques reduced confusion and increased feelings of being excited, optimistic, and comfortable with these techniques
C_LIO_LIThe ranking of preference is linked with the perceived safety but not with perceived efficiency of techniques indicating safety as more important criterion

        <p class="abstract">Recent time-dependent analyses of stress-related disorders have identified heterogeneity of trajectories and their modifying factors. While psychiatric patients are vulnerable to stress events, it is unclear how psychiatric conditions in the general population modulate subsequent stress responses. Using our longitudinal online survey from before the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic follow-ups (n = 3815 Japanese adults), here we identified four trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a latent growth mixture model; resilient, chronic, mild chronic, and early response. The depression/anxiety were identified as specific risk factors for the early-response trajectory. In contrast, general psychiatric burden and social withdrawal were identified as common risk/protective factors. Further, we estimated &#34;baseline&#34; PTSS to determine the predictability of the PTSS prognosis from pre-pandemic states. The chronic group showed significantly higher baseline PTSS scores than the mild-chronic and early-response groups, both of which were significantly higher than the resilient group. We concluded that prior psychiatric conditions significantly affect the PTSS trajectory. These results suggest that prior psychiatric conditions may be considered for the prevention and treatment of maladaptive stress responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Insomnia is prevalent along the trajectory of Alzheimer disease (AD), but the neurobiological underpinning of their interaction is poorly understood. Here, we assessed structural and functional brain measures within and between the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Methods: We selected 320 subjects from the ADNI database and divided by their diagnosis: cognitively normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD, with and without self-reported insomnia symptoms. We measured the gray matter volume (GMV), structural covariance (SC), degrees centrality (DC) , and functional connectivity (FC). We tested the effect and interaction of insomnia symptoms and diagnosis on each index across groups. Subsequently, we performed a within-group linear regression for each network. Finally, we correlated brain abnormalities with cognitive scores. Results: Insomnia symptoms were associated with FC alterations across all groups. The AD group also demonstrated an interaction between insomnia and diagnosis. In the CN and MCI groups, insomnia symptoms were characterized by patterns of within-network hyperconnectivity, while in the AD group, within- and between-network hypoconnectivity was observed. FC alterations within and between DMN and CEN hubs were associated with reduced MMSE scores in each of the groups. SC and GMV alterations were non-significant in the presence of insomnia symptoms, and DC indices only showed network-level alterations in the CEN for AD individuals. Conclusions: Insomnia symptoms affect the intrinsic functional organization of the three networks along the AD trajectory. Patients with AD present with a unique pattern of insomnia-related functional alterations, highlighting the profound interaction between both conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundElevated hippocampal perfusion has been observed in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathophysiology of psychosis, and that prophylactic treatment with diazepam during adolescence can prevent the development of psychosis-relevant phenotypes. Here we examined whether diazepam normalises hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals.

MethodsUsing a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 CHR-P individuals were assessed with MRI on two occasions, once following a single oral dose of diazepam (5 mg) and once following placebo. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling and sampled in native space using participant-specific hippocampus/subfield masks (CA1, subiculum, CA4/dentate gyrus). Twenty-one healthy controls (HC) were scanned using the same acquisition sequence, but without administration of diazepam or placebo. Mixed-design ANCOVAs and linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on rCBF in the hippocampus as a whole and by subfield.

ResultsUnder the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 24.1[{&#43;/-}4.8] years, 15F) showed significantly elevated rCBF compared to HC (mean[{&#43;/-}SD] age: 26.5[{&#43;/-}5.1] years, 11F) in the hippocampus (F(1,36)=8.2, pFDR=0.004) and across its subfields (all pFDR&lt;0.001). Following diazepam, rCBF in the hippocampus (and subfields, all pFDR&lt;0.001) was significantly reduced (t(69)=-5.1, pFDR&lt;0.001) and normalised to HC levels (F(1,41)=0.3, pFDR=0.225).

ConclusionsDiazepam can normalise hippocampal hyperperfusion in CHR-P individuals, consistent with evidence implicating medial temporal GABAergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating condition associated with a high prevalence of medical comorbidities and premature mortality. This is the first study to explore, through high-throughput-omics combined with bioinformatics, molecular signatures, pathways, and main medical diseases related to different stages of BD. Blood samples from BD patients (n=10) classified into high (BD&#43;) or poor functioning (BD-), based on functional and cognitive status, and healthy controls (n=5) were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Bioinformatics was performed to detect biological processes, pathways, and diseases related to BD. Eight proteins exclusively characterized the molecular profile of patients with BD&#43; compared to HC, while 26 altered proteins were observed in the BD-group. These altered proteins were mainly enriched in biological processes related to lipid metabolism, complement system and coagulation cascade, and cardiovascular diseases; all these changes were more prominent in the BD-group. These findings may represent systemic alterations that occur with the progression of the illness and a possible link between BD and medical comorbidities. Such comprehensive understanding provides valuable insights for targeted interventions, addressing mental and physical health aspects in subjects with BD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AbtractThe probabilistic reversal learning paradigm is one of the most used to assess cognitive flexibility during a contingency-based learning process. Lack of cognitive flexibility is related to the symptomatology that characterizes disorders such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) could be a specific predictor of performance in contingency-based cognitive flexibility. However, the mechanisms underlying learning and flexibility in an environment of uncertainty with OCD or ADHD adults have not been widely explored. Computational modelling may be helpful to separate components of the behavioural processes and identify the source of the disorders. In the present study, we aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying contingency-based cognitive flexibility in a sample of the impulsive-compulsive spectrum and healthy controls, and explore the rsFC between the frontoparietal networks (FPN) regions as a possible neuromarker. 148 Spanish-speaking participants (43 patients with OCD, 53 with ADHD, and 52 healthy controls) completed a probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT). Previously, we obtained a record of FNP rsFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, we applied the reinforcement learning model in combination with Bayesian GLM. We found that groups showed an optimal performance in the acquisition phase of the PRLT and higher performance of HC compared to the diagnostic groups in the reversal block, although performance is still optimal in all groups. Likewise, we found that the parameters studied (reinforcement learning rate, punishment learning rate and inverse temperature) predict task performance differently by phase and group. Regarding FNP rsFC, we found that rsFC between left posterior parietal cortex (lpPC) and right posterior parietal cortex (rpPC) seems to credibly predict performance in the acquisition block in the healthy controls. These findings suggest that reducing the uncertainty between action-outcome may help to improve the adaptation of ADHD and OCD patients to changing environments. Thus, understanding sensitivity to punishment or reinforcement and its influence on the decision-making may be important for designing case-specific interventions. According to our data, rsFC between lpPC and rpPC could be important for optimal learning of our task.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThere is a pressing need to reduce the long duration of untreated illness and improve care and outcomes for people with psychosis in Ethiopia. This study aimed to map community resources that have the potential to be leveraged to achieve earlier and more recovery-oriented interventions for people with psychosis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

MethodA strength-based resource mapping exercise was undertaken in two sub-cities, covering an estimated population of half a million people. We identified the types of resources to be mapped, based on their importance for multi-sectoral care in mental health: healthcare facilities, religious organisations, traditional and faith healers, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and social/community organisations. The lead investigator traversed the study sites to gather information on community resources, recorded the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the resources, and consulted with key informants. The information obtained was complemented by a participatory Theory of Change workshop attended by 30 stakeholders.

ResultsWe identified 124 health facilities, of which only 16 health centres and nine hospitals currently provide mental health services. We identified three registered traditional healers, 38 religious organisations, 104 non-governmental organisations, and other charitable/community-based organisations. In addition, three health facilities, six holy water religious healing sites, and four traditional healers were identified as out-of-site resources that were popular and frequently visited by people living in the sub-cities. The two sub-cities also had six feeding centres each providing meals for 1000 people in need. There were extensive networks of social organisations and community-based associations. Existing care pathways are complex but commonly include traditional and religious healing sites as places of first contact.

ConclusionsWe identified important available resources that provide a wealth of opportunities for improving the early identification and outcomes of people with psychosis.</p>
