V.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.23298729\nExcitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance has long been considered one of the primary neurobiological theories explaining autism. However, the theory has been bolstered heavily by research on high-penetrance genetic mechanisms which are only found in a small proportion of the autism population. Thus, how well does E:I imbalance explain idiopathic autism? Here we find that idiopathic autistic males can be split into two distinct E:I-defined neurosubtypes. These E:I neurosubtypes can be identified in EEG data via an E:I-sensitive metric known as the Hurst exponent (H). Half of autistic individuals fall into the first E:I neurosubtype and can be described as having elevated E:I ratio relative to typically-developing (TD) comparison group. The remaining other half of autistic males fall into a second E:I neurosubtype with the opposite pattern of reduced E:I ratio relative to TD. Finally, E:I neurosubtypes show differential relationships between H and behavioral and demographic variables consisting of age, intelligence, and autism symptomatology. This work suggests that different types of E:I imbalance can manifest in idiopathic autistic males. Such differential E:I biomarkers may be indicative of distinctive etiological or compensatory mechanisms and differential underlying micro- and macroscale neural organization with differential phenotypic impact.\nPsychological outcomes of 12-15-year-olds with gender dysphoria receiving pubertal suppression in the UK: assessing reliable and clinically significant change\nAuthors: McPherson, S.; Freedman, D. E. P.\nScore: 128.9, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.30.23290763\nThe evidence base for psychological benefits of GnRHA for adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD) was deemed \"low quality\" by the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Limitations identified include inattention to clinical importance of findings. This secondary analysis of UK clinical study data uses Reliable and Clinically Significant Change approaches to address this gap. The original uncontrolled study collected data within a specialist GD service. Participants were 44 12-15-year-olds with GD. Puberty was suppressed using \"triptorelin\"; participants were followed-up for 36 months. Secondary analysis used data from parent-report Child Behaviour Checklists and Youth Self-Report forms. Reliable change results: 15-34 percent of participants reliably deteriorated depending on the subscale, time point and parent versus child report. Clinically significant change results: 27-58 percent were in the borderline (subclinical) or clinical range at baseline (depending on subscale and parent or child report). Rates of clinically significant change ranged from 0-35%, decreasing over time towards zero on both self-report and parent-report. The approach offers an established complementary method to analyse individual level change and to examine who might benefit or otherwise from treatment in a field where research designs have been challenged by lack of control groups and low sample sizes.\nComputational phenotyping of aberrant belief updating in individuals with schizotypal traits and schizophrenia\nAuthors: Mikus, N.; Lamm, C.; Mathys, C. D.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23299069\nPsychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = -0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.\nSociodemographic and clinical risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in functional/dissociative seizures and epilepsy: a large cohort study\nAuthors: Faiman, I.; Hodsoll, J.; Jasani, I.; Young, A. H.; Shotbolt, P.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298811\nObjective. To identify risk factors for first episodes of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) or epilepsy. Methods. Retrospective cohort study from the UK s largest tertiary mental health care provider, with linked national admission data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Participants were 2383 people with a primary or secondary diagnosis of FDS or epilepsy attending between 01/01/2007 and 18/06/2021. Outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and a first hospital admission for suicide attempt (ICD-10 X60-X84). Demographic and clinical risk factors were assessed using multivariable bias-reduced binomial-response generalised linear models. Results. In both groups, ethnic minorities had significantly reduced odds of hospitalisations following a suicide attempt (OR: 0.45 - 0.49). Disorder-specific risk factors were gender, age, and comorbidity profile. In FDS, both genders had similar risk of suicidality; younger age was a risk factor for both outcomes (OR: 0.16 - 1.91) and a diagnosis of Depression or Personality Disorders was associated with higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation (OR: 1.91 and 3.01 respectively). In epilepsy, females had higher odds of being hospitalised following suicide attempt (OR: 1.64). Age had a quadratic association with both outcomes (OR: 0.88 - 1.06). A Substance Abuse Disorder was associated to higher suicidal ideation (OR: 2.67) whilst Developmental Disorders lowered the risk (OR: 0.16 - 0.24). Conclusions. This is the first study systematically reporting risk factors for suicidality in people with FDS. Results for the large epilepsy cohort complement previous studies and will be useful in future meta-analyses.\nConvergent functional effects of antidepressants in major depressive disorder: a neuroimaging meta-analysis\nAuthors: Saberi, A.; Ebneabbasi, A.; Rahimi, S.; Sarebannejad, S.; Sen, Z. D.; Graf, H.; Walter, M.; Sorg, C.; Camilleri, J. A.; Laird, A. R.; Fox, P. T.; Valk, S. L.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.23298991\nBackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems. MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps. ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters. ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.\nBinary classification of English Reddit posts self-reporting a social anxiety disorder diagnosis\nAuthors: Singh, S.; Bedi, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298362\nThis paper presents the system developed by Team ThaparUni for the Social Media Mining for Health Applications (SMM4H) 2023 Shared Task 4. The task involved binary classification of English Reddit posts, focusing on self-reporting social anxiety disorder (SAD) diagnoses. The final system employed a combination of three models: RoBERTa, ERNIE, and XLNet, and results obtained from all three models were integrated. The results, specifically in the context of mental health-related content analysis on social media platforms, show the possibility and viability of using multiple models in binary classification tasks.\nCognitive and inflammatory heterogeneity in severe mental illness: Translating findings from blood to brain\nAuthors: Saether, L. S.; Szabo, A.; Akkouh, I. A.; Haatveit, B.; Mohn, C.; Vaskinn, A.; Aukrust, P.; Ormerod, M. B. E. G.; Steen, N. E.; Melle, I.; Djurovic, S.; Andreassen, O. A.; Ueland, T.; Ueland, T.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.23297924\nRecent findings link cognitive impairment and inflammatory-immune dysregulation in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BD) spectrum disorders. However, heterogeneity and translation between the periphery and central (blood-to-brain) mechanisms remains a challenge. Starting with a large SZ, BD and healthy control cohort (n=1235), we aimed to i) identify candidate peripheral markers (n=25) associated with cognitive domains (n=9) and elucidate heterogenous immune-cognitive patterns, ii) evaluate the regulation of candidate markers using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells (n=10), and iii) evaluate candidate marker messenger RNA expression in leukocytes using microarray in available data from a subsample of the main cohort (n=776), and in available RNA-sequencing deconvolution analysis of postmortem brain samples (n=474) from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC). We identified transdiagnostic subgroups based on covariance between cognitive domains (measures of speed and verbal learning) and peripheral markers reflecting inflammatory response (CRP, sTNFR1, YKL-40), innate immune activation (MIF) and extracellular matrix remodelling (YKL-40, CatS). Of the candidate markers there was considerable variance in secretion of YKL-40 in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells in SZ compared to HC. Further, we provide evidence of dysregulated RNA expression of genes encoding YKL-40 and related signalling pathways in a high inflammatory subgroup consisting predominantly of SZ in the postmortem brain samples. Our findings suggest a relationship between peripheral inflammatory-immune activity and cognitive impairment, and highlight YKL-40 as a potential marker of cognitive functioning in a subgroup of individuals with severe mental illness.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Excitation-inhibition (E:I) imbalance has long been considered one of the primary neurobiological theories explaining autism. However, the theory has been bolstered heavily by research on high-penetrance genetic mechanisms which are only found in a small proportion of the autism population. Thus, how well does E:I imbalance explain idiopathic autism? Here we find that idiopathic autistic males can be split into two distinct E:I-defined  neurosubtypes. These E:I neurosubtypes can be identified in EEG data via an E:I-sensitive metric known as the Hurst exponent (H). Half of autistic individuals fall into the first E:I neurosubtype and can be described as having elevated E:I ratio relative to typically-developing (TD) comparison group. The remaining other half of autistic males fall into a second E:I neurosubtype with the opposite pattern of reduced E:I ratio relative to TD. Finally, E:I neurosubtypes show differential relationships between H and behavioral and demographic variables consisting of age, intelligence, and autism symptomatology. This work suggests that different types of E:I imbalance can manifest in idiopathic autistic males. Such differential E:I biomarkers may be indicative of distinctive etiological or compensatory mechanisms and differential underlying micro- and macroscale neural organization with differential phenotypic impact.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evidence base for psychological benefits of GnRHA for adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD) was deemed &#34;low quality&#34; by the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Limitations identified include inattention to clinical importance of findings. This secondary analysis of UK clinical study data uses Reliable and Clinically Significant Change approaches to address this gap. The original uncontrolled study collected data within a specialist GD service. Participants were 44 12-15-year-olds with GD. Puberty was suppressed using &#34;triptorelin&#34;; participants were followed-up for 36 months. Secondary analysis used data from parent-report Child Behaviour Checklists and Youth Self-Report forms. Reliable change results: 15-34 percent of participants reliably deteriorated depending on the subscale, time point and parent versus child report. Clinically significant change results: 27-58 percent were in the borderline (subclinical) or clinical range at baseline (depending on subscale and parent or child report). Rates of clinically significant change ranged from 0-35%, decreasing over time towards zero on both self-report and parent-report. The approach offers an established complementary method to analyse individual level change and to examine who might benefit or otherwise from treatment in a field where research designs have been challenged by lack of control groups and low sample sizes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychotic and psychotic-like experiences are thought to emerge from various patterns of disrupted belief updating. These include belief rigidity, overestimating the reliability of sensory information, and misjudging task volatility. Yet, these substrates have never been jointly addressed under one computational framework and it is not clear to what degree they reflect trait-like computational patterns. Here, we introduce a computational model that describes interindividual differences in how individuals update their beliefs about a volatile environment through noisy observations and use this model in a series of studies. In a test-retest study with healthy participants (N = 45, 4 sessions), we find that interclass correlations were moderate to high for session-level model parameters and excellent for averaged belief trajectories and learning rates estimated through hierarchical Bayesian inference. Across three studies (total N=590) we then demonstrate that two distinct computational patterns describe two different transdiagnostic categories. Higher uncertainty about the task volatility is related to schizotypal traits (N = 45, d = 0.687, P = 0.02, N = 437, d = 0.14, P = 0.032) and to positive symptoms in a sample of patients with schizophrenia (N = 108, d = 0.187, P = 0.039), when learning to gain rewards. In contrast, depressive-anxious traits were associated with more rigid beliefs about the underlying mean (N = 437, d = -0.125, P = 0.006) and outcome variance (N = 437, d = -0.111, P = 0.013), as were negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (d = -0.223, P = 0.026, d = -0.298, P = 0.003), when learning to avoid losses. These findings suggest that individuals high on schizotypal traits across the psychosis continuum are less likely to learn or utilize higher-order statistical regularities of the environment and showcase the potential of clinically relevant computational phenotypes for differentiating symptom groups in a transdiagnostic manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective. To identify risk factors for first episodes of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) or epilepsy. Methods. Retrospective cohort study from the UK s largest tertiary mental health care provider, with linked national admission data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Participants were 2383 people with a primary or secondary diagnosis of FDS or epilepsy attending between 01/01/2007 and 18/06/2021. Outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and a first hospital admission for suicide attempt (ICD-10 X60-X84). Demographic and clinical risk factors were assessed using multivariable bias-reduced binomial-response generalised linear models. Results. In both groups, ethnic minorities had significantly reduced odds of hospitalisations following a suicide attempt (OR: 0.45 - 0.49). Disorder-specific risk factors were gender, age, and comorbidity profile. In FDS, both genders had similar risk of suicidality; younger age was a risk factor for both outcomes (OR: 0.16 - 1.91) and a diagnosis of Depression or Personality Disorders was associated with higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation (OR: 1.91 and 3.01 respectively). In epilepsy, females had higher odds of being hospitalised following suicide attempt (OR: 1.64). Age had a quadratic association with both outcomes (OR: 0.88 - 1.06). A Substance Abuse Disorder was associated to higher suicidal ideation (OR: 2.67) whilst Developmental Disorders lowered the risk (OR: 0.16 - 0.24). Conclusions. This is the first study systematically reporting risk factors for suicidality in people with FDS. Results for the large epilepsy cohort complement previous studies and will be useful in future meta-analyses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundNeuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the macroscale impacts of antidepressants on brain functions in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the findings of individual studies are inconsistent. Here, we aimed to provide a quantitative synthesis of the literature to identify convergence of the reported findings at both regional and network levels and to examine their associations with neurotransmitter systems.

MethodsThrough a comprehensive search in PubMed and Scopus databases, we reviewed 5,258 abstracts and identified 37 eligible functional neuroimaging studies on antidepressant effects in major depressive disorder. Activation likelihood estimation was used to investigate regional convergence of the reported foci of consistent antidepressant effects, followed by functional decoding and connectivity mapping of the convergent clusters. Additionally, utilizing group-averaged data from the Human Connectome Project, we assessed convergent resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the reported foci. Next, we compared the convergent circuit with the circuits targeted by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy. Last, we studied the association of regional and network-level convergence maps with the selected neurotransmitter receptors/transporters maps.

ResultsWe found regional convergence of the reported treatment-associated increases of functional measures in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was associated with working memory and attention behavioral domains. No regional convergence was found across foci of alterations in functional imaging associated with antidepressants. Moreover, we found network-level convergence of functional alterations in a circuit that was prominent in the frontoparietal and salience networks. This circuit was co-aligned with a circuit targeted by anti-subgenual TMS therapy. We observed no significant correlations between our meta-analytic findings with the maps of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters.

ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as frontoparietal network and the salience network in the therapeutic effects of anti-depressants, possibly associated with their role in improving executive functions and emotional processing.</p>

The task involved binary classification of English Reddit posts, focusing on self-reporting social anxiety disorder (SAD) diagnoses. The final system employed a combination of three models: RoBERTa, ERNIE, and XLNet, and results obtained from all three models were integrated. The results, specifically in the context of mental health-related content analysis on social media platforms, show the possibility and viability of using multiple models in binary classification tasks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent findings link cognitive impairment and inflammatory-immune dysregulation in schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BD) spectrum disorders. However, heterogeneity and translation between the periphery and central (blood-to-brain) mechanisms remains a challenge. Starting with a large SZ, BD and healthy control cohort (n=1235), we aimed to i) identify candidate peripheral markers (n=25) associated with cognitive domains (n=9) and elucidate heterogenous immune-cognitive patterns, ii) evaluate the regulation of candidate markers using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells (n=10), and iii) evaluate candidate marker messenger RNA expression in leukocytes using microarray in available data from a subsample of the main cohort (n=776), and in available RNA-sequencing deconvolution analysis of postmortem brain samples (n=474) from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC). We identified transdiagnostic subgroups based on covariance between cognitive domains (measures of speed and verbal learning) and peripheral markers reflecting inflammatory response (CRP, sTNFR1, YKL-40), innate immune activation (MIF) and extracellular matrix remodelling (YKL-40, CatS). Of the candidate markers there was considerable variance in secretion of YKL-40 in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neural progenitor cells in SZ compared to HC. Further, we provide evidence of dysregulated RNA expression of genes encoding YKL-40 and related signalling pathways in a high inflammatory subgroup consisting predominantly of SZ in the postmortem brain samples. Our findings suggest a relationship between peripheral inflammatory-immune activity and cognitive impairment, and highlight YKL-40 as a potential marker of cognitive functioning in a subgroup of individuals with severe mental illness.</p>
