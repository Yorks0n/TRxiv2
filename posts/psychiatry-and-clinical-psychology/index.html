Females are less likely to be diagnosed or prescribed ADHD medication. This study uses national healthcare records, to investigate sex differences in diagnosis and clinical care in young people with ADHD, particularly regarding recognition and treatment of other mental health conditions. MethodThe cohort included individuals diagnosed with ADHD, born between 1989 and 2013 and living in Wales between 2000 and 2019. Routine primary and secondary healthcare record data were used to derive diagnoses of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions, as well as ADHD and antidepressant medications. Demographic variables included ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and contact with social services. ResultsThere were 16,458 individuals diagnosed with ADHD (20.3% females, ages 3-30 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1. Higher ratios (4.8:1) were seen in individuals diagnosed younger (\u003c12 years), with the lowest ratio (1.9:1) in those diagnosed as adults (\u003e18). Males were younger at first recorded ADHD diagnosis (mean=10.9 vs 12.6 years), more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, and younger at diagnosis of co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions. In contrast, females were more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition and to be prescribed antidepressant medications, prior to ADHD diagnosis. These sex differences were largely stable across demographic groups. ConclusionThis study adds to the evidence base that females with ADHD are experiencing later recognition and treatment of ADHD. The results indicate that this may be partly because of diagnostic over-shadowing from other mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, or initial misdiagnosis. Further research and dissemination of findings to the public are needed to improve awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in females.\nThe effectiveness, implementation, and experiences of peer support approaches for mental health: a systematic umbrella review\nAuthors: Cooper, R.; Saunders, K.; Greenburgh, A.; Shah, P.; Appleton, R.; Machin, K.; Jeynes, T.; Barnett, P.; Allan, S. M.; Griffiths, J.; Stuart, R.; Mitchell, L.; Chipp, B.; Jeffreys, S.; Lloyd-Evans, B.; Simpson, A.; Johnson, S.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297394\nBackgroundPeer support for mental health is recommended across international policy guidance and provision and has recently been expanded in countries including the UK. We conducted a systematic umbrella review, summarising the evidence from published reviews of the: 1) effectiveness, 2) implementation, and 3) experiences of paid peer support approaches for mental health. MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Campbell Collaboration, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from January 2012-November 2022) for published reviews of paid peer support interventions for mental health. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR2. Results were synthesised narratively, with implementation reported in accordance with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). ResultsWe included 35 reviews: systematic reviews with (n=13) or without (n=13) meta-analysis, systematic reviews with qualitative synthesis (n=3), and scoping reviews (n=6). The reviews included 426 primary studies and between 95-40,927 participants. Most reviews were low or critically low (97%) quality, one review was high quality. Effectiveness was investigated in 23 reviews. While results were mixed, there was some evidence from meta-analyses that peer support may improve depression symptoms (particularly in perinatal depression), self-efficacy, and recovery. Factors promoting successful implementation, investigated in 9 reviews, included adequate training and supervision, a recovery-oriented workplace, strong leadership, and a supportive and trusting workplace culture with effective collaboration. Barriers to implementation included lack of time, resources and funding, and a lack of recognised PSW certification. Experiences of peer support were explored in 11 reviews, with 3 overarching themes: i) what the peer support role could contribute, including recovery and improved wellbeing for both service users and peer support workers (PSWs); ii) confusion over the PSW role, including role ambiguity and unclear boundaries; and iii) organisational challenges, including low pay for PSWs, negative non-peer staff attitudes, and lack of support and training. DiscussionPeer support may be effective at improving some clinical outcomes, self-efficacy, and recovery outcomes for some people. Evidence suggests that certain populations, such as perinatal populations, may especially benefit from peer support. Potential strategies to successfully implement PSWs in healthcare settings include coproduction, with clearly defined PSW roles, a receptive hierarchical structure and staff, strong leadership, and appropriate PSW and staff training with clinical and/or peer supervision alongside safeguarding. Services could also benefit from clear, coproduced, setting specific implementation guidelines for PSW. PSW roles tend to be poorly defined and associations between content of PSW interventions and their impacts needs further investigation. Future research in this area should reflect the priorities of those directly involved in peer support, either as providers or service users.\nPrediction of response to transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment for depression using electroencephalography and statistical learning methods, including an out-of-sample validation\nAuthors: Bailey, N. W.; Fulcher, B. D.; Arns, M.; Fitzgerald, P. B.; Fitzgibbon, B. M.; van Dijk, H.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.23297492\nBackground: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy for treating depression, but not for all patients. Accurate treatment response prediction could lower treatment burden. Research suggests machine learning trained with electroencephalographic (EEG) data may predict response, but only a limited range of measures have been tested. Objectives: We used \u003e7000 time-series features to comprehensively test whether rTMS treatment response could be predicted in a discovery dataset and an independent dataset. Methods: Baseline EEG from 188 patients with depression treated with rTMS (125 responders) were decomposed into the top five principal components (PCs). The hctsa toolbox was used to extract 7304 time-series features from each participant and PC. A classification algorithm was trained to predict responders from the feature matrix separately for each PC. The classifier was applied to an independent dataset (N = 58) to test generalizability on an unseen sample. Results: Within the discovery dataset, the third PC (which showed a posterior-maximum and prominent alpha power) showed above-chance classification accuracy (68%, pFDR = 0.005, normalised positive predictive value = 114%). Other PCs did not outperform chance. The model generalized to the independent dataset with above-chance balanced accuracy (60%, p = 0.046, normalised positive predictive value = 114%). Analysis of feature-clusters suggested responders showed more high frequency power relative to total power, and a more negative skew in the distribution of their time-series values. Conclusion: The dynamical properties of PC3 predicted treatment response with moderate accuracy, which generalized to an independent dataset. Results suggest treatment stratification from pre-treatment EEG may be possible, potentially enabling better outcomes than \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment approaches.\nA Pilot Study of a Ketogenic Diet in Bipolar Disorder: Clinical, Metabolomic and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Outcomes\nAuthors: Campbell, I. H.; Needham, N.; Grossi, H.; Kamenska, I.; Luz, S.; Sheehan, S.; Thompson, G.; Thrippleton, M. J.; Gibbs, M. C.; Leitao, J.; Moses, T.; Burgess, K.; Meadowcroft, B.; Rigby, B.; Simpson, S.; McIntosh, E.; Brown, R.; Grigorjeva, M. M.; Creasy, F.; Norrie, J.; Mclellan, A.; Fisher, C.; Campbell, H.; Smith, D.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.23297391\nBackgroundBipolar disorder and epilepsy are treated with anti-seizure medications. Preliminary evidence indicates that a ketogenic diet (a metabolic treatment for epilepsy) may be effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder. AimsTo explore the impact of a ketogenic diet on clinical outcomes, and metabolomic and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers. MethodsEuthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (N=27) were recruited to a 6-8 week single-arm trial of a modified ketogenic diet and a range of metabolic and clinical outcome measures were assessed. ResultsThere was a positive correlation between daily ketone levels and ecological momentary assessments of mood (p \u003c 0.001) and energy (p \u003c 0.001) and an inverse correlation between ketone levels and impulsivity (p \u003c 0.001) and anxiety (p \u003c 0.001). Mean weight fell by 4.2kg (p \u003c 0.001), mean BMI fell by 5.3% (p \u003c 0.001) and mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7.4 mmHg (p \u003c 0.041). Brain Glx (a putative marker of treatment response to anti-seizure medication) decreased by 13.1% in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p \u003c 0.001) and by 9.2% in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC (p = 0.02). At the dietary cessation period, one third of participants, who reported reduced mood lability, opted to remain on a ketogenic diet. ConclusionThe majority of participants had improved cardiometabolic risk parameters and approximately one third experienced improvement in psychiatric symptoms. The study findings are consistent with our a priori hypothesis of ketone bodies acting as an alternative metabolic substrate under conditions of impaired insulin signalling in a subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder. Practitioner PointsA ketogenic diet may be effective in improving cardiometabolic risk factors and managing medication-induced weight gain. 95% of participants lost weight with a mean of 4.2kg (p \u003c 0.001) over 8 weeks. Ketone level was correlated to improved daily ecological momentary assessments of mood (p \u003c 0.001) and energy (p \u003c 0.001) and decreased impulsivity (p \u003c 0.001) and anxiety (p \u003c 0.001). Participants who opted out of the dietary cessation period to remain on the diet, and who had reduced Affective Lability Scores, were characterised by more pronounced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR + 27.19%) and higher fasting insulin (+ 19.26%) at baseline. Study Registration Number: ISRCTN61613198\nThe Neural Correlates of Autonomic Interoception in a Clinical Sample: Implications for Anxiety\nAuthors: Grimes, P. Z.; Kampoureli, C. N.; Rae, C. L.; Harrison, N. A.; Garfinkel, S. N.; Critchley, H. D.; Eccles, J. A.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.25.23290230\nInteroceptive mismatch is a perceptual discrepancy between ascending bodily signals and higher-order representation of anticipated physiological state. Inspired by predictive coding models, we present autonomic perceptual mismatch as a measure of this discrepancy for clinical application to brain-body interactions. Joint hypermobility is disproportionately found in individuals with anxiety disorders. Previous work has shown atypical autonomic reactivity represents a likely mediating mechanism consequent of altered connective tissue in the vasculature and nervous system. This fMRI study investigates the neural substrates of autonomic perceptual mismatch on affective processing in the hypermobility-anxiety interaction. We compared regional brain activity during emotional face processing in participants with and without hypermobility and generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis, then tested association with perceptual mismatch. In the brain, autonomic perceptual mismatch correlated with enhanced activation in emotion processing and autonomic control regions, notably anterior cingulate cortex. Anxious individuals exhibited increased mid-insula cortex activity in relation to perceptual mismatch. Activity was decreased within the inferior frontal gyrus, a region implicated in cognitive control. Dysautonomia mediated the link between hypermobility and anxiety. Together, these findings support a neural basis of an autonomic perceptual mismatch model in a clinical sample. This is supported by the engagement of neural systems for emotion-cognition and interoception. This work highlights convergent aspects of neurodiversity, mental health, connective tissue disorders and brain-body interactions relevant to precision healthcare.\nThe neuronal chromatin landscape in adult schizophrenia brains is linked to early fetal development\nAuthors: Girdhar, K.; Bendl, J.; Baumgartner, A.; Therrien, K.; Venkatesh, S.; Mathur, D.; Dong, P.; Rahman, S.; Kleopoulos, S. P.; Misir, R.; Reach, S. M.; Auluck, P.; Marenco, S.; Lewis, D. A.; Haroutunian, V.; Funk, C.; Voloudakis, G.; Hoffman, G. E.; Fullard, J.; Roussos, P.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.23296067\nNon-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.\nTranscriptomic pathology of neocortical microcircuit cell types across psychiatric disorders\nAuthors: Arbabi, K.; Newton, D. F.; Oh, H.; Davie, M. C.; Lewis, D. A.; Wainberg, M.; Tripathy, S. J.; Sibille, E.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.23297640\nBackground: Psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) are characterized by altered cognition and mood, brain functions that depend on information processing by cortical microcircuits. We hypothesized that psychiatric disorders would display cell type-specific transcriptional alterations in neuronal subpopulations that make up cortical microcircuits: excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP), somatostatin- (SST), and parvalbumin- (PVALB) expressing inhibitory interneurons. Methods: We performed cell type-specific molecular profiling of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood and cognitive control, using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq). We sequenced libraries from 130 whole cells pooled per neuronal subtype (VIP, SST, PVALB, superficial and deep PYR) in 76 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Tissue Donation Program, evenly split between MDD, BD and SCZ subjects and healthy controls. Results: We identified hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes and biological pathways across disorders and neuronal subtypes, with the vast majority in inhibitory neuron types, particularly PVALB. DE genes were distinct across cell types, but partially shared across disorders, with nearly all shared genes involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. Coordinated alterations in biological pathways were observed between select pairs of microcircuit cell types and partially shared across disorders. Finally, DE genes coincided with known risk variants from psychiatric genome-wide association studies, indicating cell type-specific convergence between genetic and transcriptomic risk for psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: We present the first cell type-specific dataset of cortical microcircuit gene expression across multiple psychiatric disorders. Each neuronal subtype displayed unique dysregulation signatures, some shared across cell types and disorders. Inhibitory interneurons showed more dysregulation than excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our study suggests transdiagnostic cortical microcircuit pathology in SCZ, BD, and MDD and sets the stage for larger-scale studies investigating how cell circuit-based changes contribute to shared psychiatric risk.\nTowards Understanding Autism Heterogeneity: Identifying Clinical Subgroups and Neuroanatomical Deviations\nAuthors: Meijer, J.; Hebling Vieira, B.; Elleaume, C.; Baranczuk-Turska, Z.; Langer, N.; Floris, D. L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.21.23297299\nAutism Spectrum Disorder ( autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial behavioural and neuroanatomical heterogeneity. This poses significant challenges to understanding its neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective interventions. Identifying phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups and shifting the focus from average group differences to individuals is a promising approach to addressing heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to parse clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity in autism by combining clustering of clinical features with normative modeling based on neuroanatomical measures (cortical thickness [CT] and subcortical volume) within the ABIDE datasets (N autism=861, N neurotypical=886, age-range 5-64). First, model-based clustering was applied to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to identify clinical subgroups of autism. Next, we examined whether clinical subgrouping resulted in increased neurobiological homogeneity within the subgroups compared to the entire autism group by comparing their spatial overlap of neuroanatomical deviations. We further investigated whether the identified subgroups improved the accuracy of autism classification based on the neuroanatomical deviations using supervised machine learning with cross-validation. Results yielded two clinical subgroups primarily differing in restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRB). Both subgroups showed increased homogeneity in localized deviations with the high-RRB subgroup showing increased volume deviations in cerebellum and the low-RRB subgroup showing decreased CT deviations predominantly in the postcentral gyrus and fusiform cortex. Nevertheless, substantial within-group heterogeneity remained highlighted by the failure of the classifier to distinguish between the subgroups. Identifying subgroups of autism has substantial clinical implications opening the potential for more tailored behavioural interventions and improving clinical outcomes. General Scientific SummaryAutism is characterized by pronounced behavioural and neurobiological heterogeneity. This study suggests that reducing this heterogeneity at the clinical level by employing subgrouping also results in more similar neuroanatomical profiles in the identified clinical subgroups. Although we could demonstrate that clinical subgrouping reduces neuroanatomical heterogeneity, simultaneously, there remained substantial heterogeneity potentially pointing towards multiple pathways resulting in high RRBs and neurobiological subgroups with similar clinical phenotypes.\nPhysical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services: a scoping review\nAuthors: Tew, G.; Peckham, E.; Ker, S.; Smith, J.; Hodgson, P.; Machaczek, K.; Faires, M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.23297222\nPeople with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPopulation-based studies have observed sex biases in the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Females are less likely to be diagnosed or prescribed ADHD medication. This study uses national healthcare records, to investigate sex differences in diagnosis and clinical care in young people with ADHD, particularly regarding recognition and treatment of other mental health conditions.

MethodThe cohort included individuals diagnosed with ADHD, born between 1989 and 2013 and living in Wales between 2000 and 2019. Routine primary and secondary healthcare record data were used to derive diagnoses of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions, as well as ADHD and antidepressant medications. Demographic variables included ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and contact with social services.

ResultsThere were 16,458 individuals diagnosed with ADHD (20.3% females, ages 3-30 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 3.9:1. Higher ratios (4.8:1) were seen in individuals diagnosed younger (&lt;12 years), with the lowest ratio (1.9:1) in those diagnosed as adults (&gt;18). Males were younger at first recorded ADHD diagnosis (mean=10.9 vs 12.6 years), more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, and younger at diagnosis of co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions. In contrast, females were more likely to receive a diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition and to be prescribed antidepressant medications, prior to ADHD diagnosis. These sex differences were largely stable across demographic groups.

ConclusionThis study adds to the evidence base that females with ADHD are experiencing later recognition and treatment of ADHD. The results indicate that this may be partly because of diagnostic over-shadowing from other mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, or initial misdiagnosis. Further research and dissemination of findings to the public are needed to improve awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPeer support for mental health is recommended across international policy guidance and provision and has recently been expanded in countries including the UK. We conducted a systematic umbrella review, summarising the evidence from published reviews of the: 1) effectiveness, 2) implementation, and 3) experiences of paid peer support approaches for mental health.

MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Campbell Collaboration, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from January 2012-November 2022) for published reviews of paid peer support interventions for mental health. Review quality was assessed using the AMSTAR2. Results were synthesised narratively, with implementation reported in accordance with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).

ResultsWe included 35 reviews: systematic reviews with (n=13) or without (n=13) meta-analysis, systematic reviews with qualitative synthesis (n=3), and scoping reviews (n=6). The reviews included 426 primary studies and between 95-40,927 participants. Most reviews were low or critically low (97%) quality, one review was high quality. Effectiveness was investigated in 23 reviews. While results were mixed, there was some evidence from meta-analyses that peer support may improve depression symptoms (particularly in perinatal depression), self-efficacy, and recovery. Factors promoting successful implementation, investigated in 9 reviews, included adequate training and supervision, a recovery-oriented workplace, strong leadership, and a supportive and trusting workplace culture with effective collaboration. Barriers to implementation included lack of time, resources and funding, and a lack of recognised PSW certification. Experiences of peer support were explored in 11 reviews, with 3 overarching themes: i) what the peer support role could contribute, including recovery and improved wellbeing for both service users and peer support workers (PSWs); ii) confusion over the PSW role, including role ambiguity and unclear boundaries; and iii) organisational challenges, including low pay for PSWs, negative non-peer staff attitudes, and lack of support and training.

DiscussionPeer support may be effective at improving some clinical outcomes, self-efficacy, and recovery outcomes for some people. Evidence suggests that certain populations, such as perinatal populations, may especially benefit from peer support. Potential strategies to successfully implement PSWs in healthcare settings include coproduction, with clearly defined PSW roles, a receptive hierarchical structure and staff, strong leadership, and appropriate PSW and staff training with clinical and/or peer supervision alongside safeguarding. Services could also benefit from clear, coproduced, setting specific implementation guidelines for PSW. PSW roles tend to be poorly defined and associations between content of PSW interventions and their impacts needs further investigation. Future research in this area should reflect the priorities of those directly involved in peer support, either as providers or service users.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy for treating depression, but not for all patients. Accurate treatment response prediction could lower treatment burden. Research suggests machine learning trained with electroencephalographic (EEG) data may predict response, but only a limited range of measures have been tested. Objectives: We used &gt;7000 time-series features to comprehensively test whether rTMS treatment response could be predicted in a discovery dataset and an independent dataset. Methods: Baseline EEG from 188 patients with depression treated with rTMS (125 responders) were decomposed into the top five principal components (PCs). The hctsa toolbox was used to extract 7304 time-series features from each participant and PC. A classification algorithm was trained to predict responders from the feature matrix separately for each PC. The classifier was applied to an independent dataset (N = 58) to test generalizability on an unseen sample. Results: Within the discovery dataset, the third PC (which showed a posterior-maximum and prominent alpha power) showed above-chance classification accuracy (68%, pFDR = 0.005, normalised positive predictive value = 114%). Other PCs did not outperform chance. The model generalized to the independent dataset with above-chance balanced accuracy (60%, p = 0.046, normalised positive predictive value = 114%). Analysis of feature-clusters suggested responders showed more high frequency power relative to total power, and a more negative skew in the distribution of their time-series values. Conclusion: The dynamical properties of PC3 predicted treatment response with moderate accuracy, which generalized to an independent dataset. Results suggest treatment stratification from pre-treatment EEG may be possible, potentially enabling better outcomes than &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34; treatment approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBipolar disorder and epilepsy are treated with anti-seizure medications. Preliminary evidence indicates that a ketogenic diet (a metabolic treatment for epilepsy) may be effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

AimsTo explore the impact of a ketogenic diet on clinical outcomes, and metabolomic and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy biomarkers.

MethodsEuthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (N=27) were recruited to a 6-8 week single-arm trial of a modified ketogenic diet and a range of metabolic and clinical outcome measures were assessed.

ResultsThere was a positive correlation between daily ketone levels and ecological momentary assessments of mood (p &lt; 0.001) and energy (p &lt; 0.001) and an inverse correlation between ketone levels and impulsivity (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001). Mean weight fell by 4.2kg (p &lt; 0.001), mean BMI fell by 5.3% (p &lt; 0.001) and mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7.4 mmHg (p &lt; 0.041). Brain Glx (a putative marker of treatment response to anti-seizure medication) decreased by 13.1% in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p &lt; 0.001) and by 9.2% in the anterior cingulate cortex ACC (p = 0.02). At the dietary cessation period, one third of participants, who reported reduced mood lability, opted to remain on a ketogenic diet.

ConclusionThe majority of participants had improved cardiometabolic risk parameters and approximately one third experienced improvement in psychiatric symptoms. The study findings are consistent with our a priori hypothesis of ketone bodies acting as an alternative metabolic substrate under conditions of impaired insulin signalling in a subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder.

Practitioner PointsA ketogenic diet may be effective in improving cardiometabolic risk factors and managing medication-induced weight gain. 95% of participants lost weight with a mean of 4.2kg (p &lt; 0.001) over 8 weeks.

Ketone level was correlated to improved daily ecological momentary assessments of mood (p &lt; 0.001) and energy (p &lt; 0.001) and decreased impulsivity (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p &lt; 0.001).

Participants who opted out of the dietary cessation period to remain on the diet, and who had reduced Affective Lability Scores, were characterised by more pronounced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR &#43; 27.19%) and higher fasting insulin (&#43; 19.26%) at baseline.

        <p class="abstract">Interoceptive mismatch is a perceptual discrepancy between ascending bodily signals and higher-order representation of anticipated physiological state. Inspired by predictive coding models, we present autonomic perceptual mismatch as a measure of this discrepancy for clinical application to brain-body interactions. Joint hypermobility is disproportionately found in individuals with anxiety disorders. Previous work has shown atypical autonomic reactivity represents a likely mediating mechanism consequent of altered connective tissue in the vasculature and nervous system.

This fMRI study investigates the neural substrates of autonomic perceptual mismatch on affective processing in the hypermobility-anxiety interaction. We compared regional brain activity during emotional face processing in participants with and without hypermobility and generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis, then tested association with perceptual mismatch.

In the brain, autonomic perceptual mismatch correlated with enhanced activation in emotion processing and autonomic control regions, notably anterior cingulate cortex. Anxious individuals exhibited increased mid-insula cortex activity in relation to perceptual mismatch. Activity was decreased within the inferior frontal gyrus, a region implicated in cognitive control. Dysautonomia mediated the link between hypermobility and anxiety.

Together, these findings support a neural basis of an autonomic perceptual mismatch model in a clinical sample. This is supported by the engagement of neural systems for emotion-cognition and interoception. This work highlights convergent aspects of neurodiversity, mental health, connective tissue disorders and brain-body interactions relevant to precision healthcare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) are characterized by altered cognition and mood, brain functions that depend on information processing by cortical microcircuits. We hypothesized that psychiatric disorders would display cell type-specific transcriptional alterations in neuronal subpopulations that make up cortical microcircuits: excitatory pyramidal (PYR) neurons and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP), somatostatin- (SST), and parvalbumin- (PVALB) expressing inhibitory interneurons. Methods: We performed cell type-specific molecular profiling of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in mood and cognitive control, using laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq). We sequenced libraries from 130 whole cells pooled per neuronal subtype (VIP, SST, PVALB, superficial and deep PYR) in 76 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh Brain Tissue Donation Program, evenly split between MDD, BD and SCZ subjects and healthy controls. Results: We identified hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes and biological pathways across disorders and neuronal subtypes, with the vast majority in inhibitory neuron types, particularly PVALB. DE genes were distinct across cell types, but partially shared across disorders, with nearly all shared genes involved in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuits. Coordinated alterations in biological pathways were observed between select pairs of microcircuit cell types and partially shared across disorders. Finally, DE genes coincided with known risk variants from psychiatric genome-wide association studies, indicating cell type-specific convergence between genetic and transcriptomic risk for psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: We present the first cell type-specific dataset of cortical microcircuit gene expression across multiple psychiatric disorders. Each neuronal subtype displayed unique dysregulation signatures, some shared across cell types and disorders. Inhibitory interneurons showed more dysregulation than excitatory pyramidal neurons. Our study suggests transdiagnostic cortical microcircuit pathology in SCZ, BD, and MDD and sets the stage for larger-scale studies investigating how cell circuit-based changes contribute to shared psychiatric risk.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Autism Spectrum Disorder ( autism) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial behavioural and neuroanatomical heterogeneity. This poses significant challenges to understanding its neurobiological mechanisms and developing effective interventions. Identifying phenotypically more homogeneous subgroups and shifting the focus from average group differences to individuals is a promising approach to addressing heterogeneity. In the present study, we aimed to parse clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity in autism by combining clustering of clinical features with normative modeling based on neuroanatomical measures (cortical thickness [CT] and subcortical volume) within the ABIDE datasets (N autism=861, N neurotypical=886, age-range 5-64). First, model-based clustering was applied to autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule to identify clinical subgroups of autism. Next, we examined whether clinical subgrouping resulted in increased neurobiological homogeneity within the subgroups compared to the entire autism group by comparing their spatial overlap of neuroanatomical deviations. We further investigated whether the identified subgroups improved the accuracy of autism classification based on the neuroanatomical deviations using supervised machine learning with cross-validation. Results yielded two clinical subgroups primarily differing in restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRB). Both subgroups showed increased homogeneity in localized deviations with the high-RRB subgroup showing increased volume deviations in cerebellum and the low-RRB subgroup showing decreased CT deviations predominantly in the postcentral gyrus and fusiform cortex. Nevertheless, substantial within-group heterogeneity remained highlighted by the failure of the classifier to distinguish between the subgroups. Identifying subgroups of autism has substantial clinical implications opening the potential for more tailored behavioural interventions and improving clinical outcomes.

General Scientific SummaryAutism is characterized by pronounced behavioural and neurobiological heterogeneity. This study suggests that reducing this heterogeneity at the clinical level by employing subgrouping also results in more similar neuroanatomical profiles in the identified clinical subgroups. Although we could demonstrate that clinical subgrouping reduces neuroanatomical heterogeneity, simultaneously, there remained substantial heterogeneity potentially pointing towards multiple pathways resulting in high RRBs and neurobiological subgroups with similar clinical phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">People with severe mental illness engage in considerably less physical activity than those without. They also experience premature mortality of around 10-25 years. A large proportion of these premature deaths are attributed to modifiable behaviours, including physical activity. The inpatient environment provides an opportunity to support people to become more physically active; however, there is limited evidence on which interventions are most successful and what contextual factors affect their delivery. A scoping review was conducted to help understand the extent and type of evidence in this area and identify research gaps. We included studies of physical activity in adult inpatient mental health services published in peer-reviewed journals. Reviews, meta-analyses, and papers focusing on eating disorder populations were excluded. We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published in English. We extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention and control conditions, key findings, and research recommendations. We used a descriptive analytical approach and results are presented in tables and figures. Of 25,437 unique records screened, 192 reports from 164 studies were included. Fifty-six studies reported on correlates of physical activity, and 125 studies reported on physical activity interventions. Most intervention studies used a single-group, pre-post design (44%) and included fewer than 100 participants (85%). Ninety percent of interventions delivered physical activity directly to participants, and 51% included group-based sessions. The duration, type, frequency and intensity of sessions varied. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome (61%), whereas physical activity was rarely an outcome (11%). Overall, there is a modest but growing body of research on physical activity in adult users of inpatient mental health services. More high-quality trials are needed to advance the field, and future research should target neglected intervention types, outcomes, populations and settings.</p>
