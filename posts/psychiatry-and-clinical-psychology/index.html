D.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293439\nBackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed when symptoms onset in childhood. Here we investigate whether individuals who are diagnosed as children differ from those who are diagnosed in adulthood with respect to shared and unique architecture at the genome-wide, functional, and gene expression level of analysis. MethodsWe utilize Genomic SEM to investigate the differences in genetic correlations of childhood and adulthood diagnosed ADHD with 98 behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, and health outcomes. We go on to apply Stratified Genomic SEM and transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) to identify functional annotations and patterns of gene expression associated with genetic risk sharing or divergence across the ADHD subgroups. ResultsRelative to the childhood subgroup, adulthood diagnosed ADHD exhibited a significantly larger negative rg with educational attainment, the noncognitive skills of educational attainment, and age at first sexual intercourse. We also observe a larger positive rg for adulthood diagnosed ADHD with major depression, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and a latent internalizing factor. At the functional and gene expression levels, Stratified Genomic SEM and T-SEM analyses revealed three annotations and 22 genes, respectively, that were significantly associated with genetic risk sharing across the subtypes. ConclusionThis project demonstrates that ADHD diagnosed later in life shows much stronger genetic overlap with internalizing disorders and related traits, indicating the potential clinical relevance of distinguishing these subgroups. Given shared clinical features across internalizing disorders and ADHD (e.g., difficulty concentrating) one interpretation is that the internalizing spectrum is often misdiagnosed as ADHD in adulthood.\nDysregulation of gut microbiota composition in individuals with personality disorders: A systemic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Rangraze, I.; khan, s.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292891\nBackgroundAnxiety disorders are the most frequent mental comorbidity in people with functional GI difficulties, and abdominal discomfort is one of the most known physical signs of sadness. Successful top-down treatments using antidepressants and psychosocial therapies in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) further define personality illnesses as more than merely CNS disorders, but disorders with highly extensive systemic interconnections. Therefore, we recently conducted a systematic review of the observational literature comparing the gut microbiota composition of persons with personality difficulties with healthy control. MethodsThis review was written according to the guidelines established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Not a single rule was broken, yet a more thorough search strategy did provide more relevant results. Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, etc. were searched thoroughly using the phrases \"gut microbiota, psychological disorders, personality disorders, composition, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, etc.\" ResultsResearchers did discover widespread differences in the gut microbiota of patients and controls under each category of personality disorder. They also found that there are distinct bacterial taxa that had differing abundances in patients with these three psychiatric illnesses compared to healthy controls. They found a great deal of variation in study designs and reporting, such as in the inclusion and exclusion of study populations, sampling feces for study of gut microbiota; taking into account or adjusting for important factors known to impact gut microbiota composition; storing feces; processing feces; analyzing feces. ConclusionOur systematic review did find that psychological disorders appeared to exhibit different overall compositional differences compared to controls. There was a general trend toward the finding of increased abundances of bacteria involved in glutamate and GABA metabolism, and lower abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria in psychological disorders\nIntegrating Genome-wide information and Wearable Device Data to Explore the Link of Anxiety and Antidepressants with Heart Rate Variability\nAuthors: Friligkou, E.; Koller, D.; Pathak, G. A.; Miller, E. J.; Lampert, R.; Stein, M.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293170\nBackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03). ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.\nClassifying autism in a clinical population based on motion synchrony: a proof-of-concept study using real-life diagnostic interviews\nAuthors: Koehler, J. C.; Dong, M. S.; Song, D.-Y.; Bong, G.; Koutsouleris, N.; Yoo, H.; Falter-Wagner, C. M.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293186\nPredictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.\nIn severe first episode major depressive disorder, psychosomatic, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia symptoms are driven by immune activation and increased immune-associated neurotoxicity.\nAuthors: Maes, M.; Almulla, A. F.; Zhou, B.; Abo Algon, A. A.; Sodsai, P.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.23293708\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by activated neuro-immune pathways, increased physiosomatic and chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia (FF) symptoms. The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors. AimsTo delineate the impact of ACE+NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles. MethodsACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls. ResultsPhysiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial Least Squares analysis shows that ACE+NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of IL-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor. ConclusionsThe physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization, Th-1, and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection.\nCharacterization of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia among women with homelessness\nAuthors: Menon, J.; Kantipudi, S. J.; Mani, A.; Radhakrishnan, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.23293378\nBackgroundStudies of schizophrenia and homelessness are often confounded by comorbid substance use. Women with schizophrenia and homelessness in India have very low rates of substance use and provide a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of illness from that of substance use. We examined the clinical characteristics of women with schizophrenia and homelessness and compared it to an age-matched group of women with schizophrenia living with their family. Methods36 women with schizophrenia and homelessness, and 32 women with schizophrenia who were illness living with family were evaluated for psychopathology using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/ Scale for assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) scales, cognitive difficulties using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)/Rowland Universal Dementia Scale (RUDAS), and Frontal Assessment Battery(FAB), disability using World Health Organization - Disability assessment Scale (WHO-DAS) and psychosocial factors using a semi-structured proforma. The groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square for continuous and categorical variables respectively. ResultsWomen with schizophrenia and homelessness were found to have significantly higher scores on measures of psychopathology, significantly lower cognitive functioning, and much higher disability, and were also on higher doses of antipsychotics. The mean scores on measures of psychopathology, cognition and disability for women with schizophrenia and homelessness differed by 2-3 standard deviations with the mean for women living with family (i.e. z scores) suggesting that they represented an extreme phenotype. Rates of past employment were higher among women with schizophrenia and homelessness. Hence these differences were not accounted for by premorbid functioning. ConclusionsThe study raises the possibility of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia with severe and persistent psychopathology non-responsive to dopamine blocking drugs, cognitive impairment, and disability, which needs further exploration.\nRacial/Ethnic Differences in COVID-19-Traumatic Symptoms, Sleep, Coping Outcomes in a Group of New-Yorkers\nAuthors: Blanc, J.; Seixas, A.; Small, S.; Auguste, E.; Briggs, A.; Antoine, Y. S.; Bubu, O. M.; Jean-Louis, G.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.23293452\nBackgroundLittle research has examined within/between group predictors and mediators of race/ethnic differences or disparities in mental and sleep health outcomes arising from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. ObjectivesThis study sought to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 experiences on trauma-related symptoms and sleep quality among a multiracial/ethnic sample in New York. MethodThis is a cross-sectional study conducted online among multiethnic adults (n=541) who experienced the pandemic in New York from September to November 2020. Comparisons of characteristics and mean scores by race/ethnicity status were conducted using one-way ANOVA and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Multilinear regression was used for associations between social determinants of health and/or SES, trauma-related symptoms, coping, and sleep. ResultsCompared to Whites [Mean (SD)= (24.1(7.6)] and other group [Mean (SD)=24.9(8.2), Blacks [Mean (SD)=(26.3(6.4)] and Hispanics [Mean(SD)=(27.2(8.2)] reported higher level of peritraumatic distress [df= 3; F=4273; p=0.005). The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms was 21.4%(n=113): [Whites=31(16.3%); Blacks=28(25.7%); Hispanics=24(25%); and other groups=30(22.4%); x2 =4.93; p=0.177]. This rate doubled [48.3%(257)] when it comes to the overall clinically significant depression level. Compared to all subcategories, [Blacks=52(47.7%); Hispanics =62(64.6%); other group=66(49.3%)], depression symptoms were lower among Whites [77(39.9%; x2 =15.71; p=0.001]. We found a prevalence of insufficient sleep \u003c6 hours of 41%(198): [Whites=69(39.4%); Blacks=43(41.7%); Hispanics=46(52.3%); other groups=40(34.2%); x2=12.21; p=0.057]. Several unique demographic predictors of PTSD emerged for distinct racial/ethnic groups. Among Blacks, sex [{beta} = -0.22; p \u003c .01] and employment [{beta} = -0.159; p \u003c .05] emerged as significant predictors for PTSD, but for no other racial/ethnic group. Interestingly, among Hispanics [{beta} = -0.144; p = .064] and Blacks [{beta} = -0.174; p = .0.076], coping strategies did not mitigate PTSD or depressive symptoms. ConclusionAs New York and the rest of the world are trying to bounce back from the COVID-19 consequences, mental health outcomes are devastating, particularly among historically marginalized communities. This study provides insight into the emergency for policymakers to invest in racial justice programs and provide free access to culturally responsive mental health care for the most vulnerable groups.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed when symptoms onset in childhood. Here we investigate whether individuals who are diagnosed as children differ from those who are diagnosed in adulthood with respect to shared and unique architecture at the genome-wide, functional, and gene expression level of analysis.

MethodsWe utilize Genomic SEM to investigate the differences in genetic correlations of childhood and adulthood diagnosed ADHD with 98 behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, and health outcomes. We go on to apply Stratified Genomic SEM and transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) to identify functional annotations and patterns of gene expression associated with genetic risk sharing or divergence across the ADHD subgroups.

ResultsRelative to the childhood subgroup, adulthood diagnosed ADHD exhibited a significantly larger negative rg with educational attainment, the noncognitive skills of educational attainment, and age at first sexual intercourse. We also observe a larger positive rg for adulthood diagnosed ADHD with major depression, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and a latent internalizing factor. At the functional and gene expression levels, Stratified Genomic SEM and T-SEM analyses revealed three annotations and 22 genes, respectively, that were significantly associated with genetic risk sharing across the subtypes.

ConclusionThis project demonstrates that ADHD diagnosed later in life shows much stronger genetic overlap with internalizing disorders and related traits, indicating the potential clinical relevance of distinguishing these subgroups. Given shared clinical features across internalizing disorders and ADHD (e.g., difficulty concentrating) one interpretation is that the internalizing spectrum is often misdiagnosed as ADHD in adulthood.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnxiety disorders are the most frequent mental comorbidity in people with functional GI difficulties, and abdominal discomfort is one of the most known physical signs of sadness. Successful top-down treatments using antidepressants and psychosocial therapies in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) further define personality illnesses as more than merely CNS disorders, but disorders with highly extensive systemic interconnections.

Therefore, we recently conducted a systematic review of the observational literature comparing the gut microbiota composition of persons with personality difficulties with healthy control.

MethodsThis review was written according to the guidelines established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Not a single rule was broken, yet a more thorough search strategy did provide more relevant results. Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, etc. were searched thoroughly using the phrases &#34;gut microbiota, psychological disorders, personality disorders, composition, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, etc.&#34;

ResultsResearchers did discover widespread differences in the gut microbiota of patients and controls under each category of personality disorder. They also found that there are distinct bacterial taxa that had differing abundances in patients with these three psychiatric illnesses compared to healthy controls. They found a great deal of variation in study designs and reporting, such as in the inclusion and exclusion of study populations, sampling feces for study of gut microbiota; taking into account or adjusting for important factors known to impact gut microbiota composition; storing feces; processing feces; analyzing feces.

ConclusionOur systematic review did find that psychological disorders appeared to exhibit different overall compositional differences compared to controls. There was a general trend toward the finding of increased abundances of bacteria involved in glutamate and GABA metabolism, and lower abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria in psychological disorders</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN.

ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03).

ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Predictive modeling strategies are increasingly studied as a means to overcome clinical bottlenecks in the diagnostic classification of autism spectrum disorder. However, while some findings are promising in the light of diagnostic marker research, many of these approaches lack the scalability for adequate and effective translation to everyday clinical practice. In this study, our aim was to explore the use of objective computer vision video analysis of real-world autism diagnostic interviews in a clinical sample of children and adolescents to predict diagnosis. Specifically, we trained a support vector machine learning model on interpersonal synchrony data recorded in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) interviews of patient-clinician dyads. Our model was able to classify dyads involving an autistic patient (n=56) with a balanced accuracy of 63.4% against dyads including a patient with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=38). Further analyses revealed no significant associations between our classification metrics with clinical ratings. We argue that, given the above-chance performance of our classifier in a highly heterogeneous sample both in age and diagnosis, with few adjustments this highly scalable approach presents a viable route for future diagnostic marker research in autism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by activated neuro-immune pathways, increased physiosomatic and chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia (FF) symptoms. The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors.

AimsTo delineate the impact of ACE&#43;NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles.

MethodsACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls.

ResultsPhysiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial Least Squares analysis shows that ACE&#43;NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of IL-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor.

ConclusionsThe physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization, Th-1, and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStudies of schizophrenia and homelessness are often confounded by comorbid substance use. Women with schizophrenia and homelessness in India have very low rates of substance use and provide a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of illness from that of substance use. We examined the clinical characteristics of women with schizophrenia and homelessness and compared it to an age-matched group of women with schizophrenia living with their family.

Methods36 women with schizophrenia and homelessness, and 32 women with schizophrenia who were illness living with family were evaluated for psychopathology using Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS)/ Scale for assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) scales, cognitive difficulties using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)/Rowland Universal Dementia Scale (RUDAS), and Frontal Assessment Battery(FAB), disability using World Health Organization - Disability assessment Scale (WHO-DAS) and psychosocial factors using a semi-structured proforma. The groups were compared using t-tests and chi-square for continuous and categorical variables respectively.

ResultsWomen with schizophrenia and homelessness were found to have significantly higher scores on measures of psychopathology, significantly lower cognitive functioning, and much higher disability, and were also on higher doses of antipsychotics. The mean scores on measures of psychopathology, cognition and disability for women with schizophrenia and homelessness differed by 2-3 standard deviations with the mean for women living with family (i.e. z scores) suggesting that they represented an extreme phenotype. Rates of past employment were higher among women with schizophrenia and homelessness. Hence these differences were not accounted for by premorbid functioning.

ConclusionsThe study raises the possibility of an extreme phenotype of schizophrenia with severe and persistent psychopathology non-responsive to dopamine blocking drugs, cognitive impairment, and disability, which needs further exploration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLittle research has examined within/between group predictors and mediators of race/ethnic differences or disparities in mental and sleep health outcomes arising from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectivesThis study sought to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 experiences on trauma-related symptoms and sleep quality among a multiracial/ethnic sample in New York.

MethodThis is a cross-sectional study conducted online among multiethnic adults (n=541) who experienced the pandemic in New York from September to November 2020. Comparisons of characteristics and mean scores by race/ethnicity status were conducted using one-way ANOVA and independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Multilinear regression was used for associations between social determinants of health and/or SES, trauma-related symptoms, coping, and sleep.

ResultsCompared to Whites [Mean (SD)= (24.1(7.6)] and other group [Mean (SD)=24.9(8.2), Blacks [Mean (SD)=(26.3(6.4)] and Hispanics [Mean(SD)=(27.2(8.2)] reported higher level of peritraumatic distress [df= 3; F=4273; p=0.005). The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms was 21.4%(n=113): [Whites=31(16.3%); Blacks=28(25.7%); Hispanics=24(25%); and other groups=30(22.4%); x2 =4.93; p=0.177]. This rate doubled [48.3%(257)] when it comes to the overall clinically significant depression level. Compared to all subcategories, [Blacks=52(47.7%); Hispanics =62(64.6%); other group=66(49.3%)], depression symptoms were lower among Whites [77(39.9%; x2 =15.71; p=0.001]. We found a prevalence of insufficient sleep &lt;6 hours of 41%(198): [Whites=69(39.4%); Blacks=43(41.7%); Hispanics=46(52.3%); other groups=40(34.2%); x2=12.21; p=0.057]. Several unique demographic predictors of PTSD emerged for distinct racial/ethnic groups. Among Blacks, sex [{beta} = -0.22; p &lt; .01] and employment [{beta} = -0.159; p &lt; .05] emerged as significant predictors for PTSD, but for no other racial/ethnic group. Interestingly, among Hispanics [{beta} = -0.144; p = .064] and Blacks [{beta} = -0.174; p = .0.076], coping strategies did not mitigate PTSD or depressive symptoms.

ConclusionAs New York and the rest of the world are trying to bounce back from the COVID-19 consequences, mental health outcomes are devastating, particularly among historically marginalized communities. This study provides insight into the emergency for policymakers to invest in racial justice programs and provide free access to culturally responsive mental health care for the most vulnerable groups.</p>
