D.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293439\nBackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed when symptoms onset in childhood. Here we investigate whether individuals who are diagnosed as children differ from those who are diagnosed in adulthood with respect to shared and unique architecture at the genome-wide, functional, and gene expression level of analysis. MethodsWe utilize Genomic SEM to investigate the differences in genetic correlations of childhood and adulthood diagnosed ADHD with 98 behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, and health outcomes. We go on to apply Stratified Genomic SEM and transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) to identify functional annotations and patterns of gene expression associated with genetic risk sharing or divergence across the ADHD subgroups. ResultsRelative to the childhood subgroup, adulthood diagnosed ADHD exhibited a significantly larger negative rg with educational attainment, the noncognitive skills of educational attainment, and age at first sexual intercourse. We also observe a larger positive rg for adulthood diagnosed ADHD with major depression, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and a latent internalizing factor. At the functional and gene expression levels, Stratified Genomic SEM and T-SEM analyses revealed three annotations and 22 genes, respectively, that were significantly associated with genetic risk sharing across the subtypes. ConclusionThis project demonstrates that ADHD diagnosed later in life shows much stronger genetic overlap with internalizing disorders and related traits, indicating the potential clinical relevance of distinguishing these subgroups. Given shared clinical features across internalizing disorders and ADHD (e.g., difficulty concentrating) one interpretation is that the internalizing spectrum is often misdiagnosed as ADHD in adulthood.\nA sex-stratified analysis of the genetic architecture of human brain anatomy\nAuthors: Shafee, R.; Moraczewski, D.; Liu, S.; Mallard, T.; Thomas, A. G.; Raznahan, A.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293881\nLarge biobanks have dramatically advanced our understanding of genetic influences on human brain anatomy. However, most studies have combined rather than compared males and females - despite theoretical grounds for potential sex differences. By systematically screening for sex differences in the common genetic architecture of \u003e 1000 neuroanatomical phenotypes in the UK Biobank, we establish a general concordance between males and females in heritability estimates, genetic correlations and variant-level effects. Notable exceptions include: higher mean h2 in females for regional volume and surface area phenotypes; between-sex genetic correlations that are significantly below 1 in the insula and parietal cortex; and, a male-specific effect common variant mapping to RBFOX1 - a gene linked to multiple male-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. This work suggests that common variant influences on human brain anatomy are largely consistent between males and females, with a few exceptions that will guide future research as biobanks continue to grow in size.\nDysregulation of gut microbiota composition in individuals with personality disorders: A systemic review and meta-analysis\nAuthors: Rangraze, I.; khan, s.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-07-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.23292891\nBackgroundAnxiety disorders are the most frequent mental comorbidity in people with functional GI difficulties, and abdominal discomfort is one of the most known physical signs of sadness. Successful top-down treatments using antidepressants and psychosocial therapies in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) further define personality illnesses as more than merely CNS disorders, but disorders with highly extensive systemic interconnections. Therefore, we recently conducted a systematic review of the observational literature comparing the gut microbiota composition of persons with personality difficulties with healthy control. MethodsThis review was written according to the guidelines established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Not a single rule was broken, yet a more thorough search strategy did provide more relevant results. Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, etc. were searched thoroughly using the phrases \"gut microbiota, psychological disorders, personality disorders, composition, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, etc.\" ResultsResearchers did discover widespread differences in the gut microbiota of patients and controls under each category of personality disorder. They also found that there are distinct bacterial taxa that had differing abundances in patients with these three psychiatric illnesses compared to healthy controls. They found a great deal of variation in study designs and reporting, such as in the inclusion and exclusion of study populations, sampling feces for study of gut microbiota; taking into account or adjusting for important factors known to impact gut microbiota composition; storing feces; processing feces; analyzing feces. ConclusionOur systematic review did find that psychological disorders appeared to exhibit different overall compositional differences compared to controls. There was a general trend toward the finding of increased abundances of bacteria involved in glutamate and GABA metabolism, and lower abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria in psychological disorders\nPrediction of depressive symptoms based on sleep quality, anxiety, and brain structure\nAuthors: Olfati, M.; Samea, F.; Faghihroohi, S.; Maleki Balajoo, S.; Genon, S.; Patil, K.; Eickhoff, S. B.; Tahmasian, M.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293887\nBackground: Depressive symptoms are rising in the general population and can lead to depression years later, but the contributing factors are less known. Although the link between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms has been reported, the predictive role of sleep on depressive symptoms severity (DSS) and the impact of anxiety and brain structure on their interrelationship at the individual subject level remain poorly understood. Methods: Here, we used 1813 participants from three population-based datasets. We applied ensemble machine learning models to assess the predictive role of sleep, anxiety, and brain structure on DSS in the primary dataset (n = 1101), then we tested the generalizability of our findings in two independent datasets. In addition, we performed a mediation analysis to identify the effect of anxiety and brain structure on the link between sleep and DSS. Results: We observed that sleep quality could predict DSS (r = 0.43, rMSE = 2.73, R2 = 0.18), and adding anxiety strengthened its prediction (r = 0.67, rMSE = 2.25, R2 = 0.45). However, brain structure (alone or along with sleep/anxiety) did not predict DSS. Importantly, out-of-cohort validations of our findings in other samples provided similar findings. Further, anxiety scores (not brain structure) could mediate the link between sleep quality and DSS. Conclusion: Taken together, poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms could predict DSS across three cohorts. We hope that our findings incentivize clinicians to consider the importance of screening and treating subjects with sleep and anxiety problems to reduce the burden of depressive symptoms.\nIn severe first episode major depressive disorder, psychosomatic, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia symptoms are driven by immune activation and increased immune-associated neurotoxicity.\nAuthors: Maes, M.; Almulla, A. F.; Zhou, B.; Abo Algon, A. A.; Sodsai, P.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.23293708\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by activated neuro-immune pathways, increased physiosomatic and chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia (FF) symptoms. The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors. AimsTo delineate the impact of ACE+NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles. MethodsACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls. ResultsPhysiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial Least Squares analysis shows that ACE+NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of IL-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor. ConclusionsThe physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization, Th-1, and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection.\nIntegrating Genome-wide information and Wearable Device Data to Explore the Link of Anxiety and Antidepressants with Heart Rate Variability\nAuthors: Friligkou, E.; Koller, D.; Pathak, G. A.; Miller, E. J.; Lampert, R.; Stein, M.; Polimanti, R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.23293170\nBackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN. ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03). ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is diagnosed when symptoms onset in childhood. Here we investigate whether individuals who are diagnosed as children differ from those who are diagnosed in adulthood with respect to shared and unique architecture at the genome-wide, functional, and gene expression level of analysis.

MethodsWe utilize Genomic SEM to investigate the differences in genetic correlations of childhood and adulthood diagnosed ADHD with 98 behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, and health outcomes. We go on to apply Stratified Genomic SEM and transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) to identify functional annotations and patterns of gene expression associated with genetic risk sharing or divergence across the ADHD subgroups.

ResultsRelative to the childhood subgroup, adulthood diagnosed ADHD exhibited a significantly larger negative rg with educational attainment, the noncognitive skills of educational attainment, and age at first sexual intercourse. We also observe a larger positive rg for adulthood diagnosed ADHD with major depression, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and a latent internalizing factor. At the functional and gene expression levels, Stratified Genomic SEM and T-SEM analyses revealed three annotations and 22 genes, respectively, that were significantly associated with genetic risk sharing across the subtypes.

ConclusionThis project demonstrates that ADHD diagnosed later in life shows much stronger genetic overlap with internalizing disorders and related traits, indicating the potential clinical relevance of distinguishing these subgroups. Given shared clinical features across internalizing disorders and ADHD (e.g., difficulty concentrating) one interpretation is that the internalizing spectrum is often misdiagnosed as ADHD in adulthood.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large biobanks have dramatically advanced our understanding of genetic influences on human brain anatomy. However, most studies have combined rather than compared males and females - despite theoretical grounds for potential sex differences. By systematically screening for sex differences in the common genetic architecture of &gt; 1000 neuroanatomical phenotypes in the UK Biobank, we establish a general concordance between males and females in heritability estimates, genetic correlations and variant-level effects. Notable exceptions include: higher mean h2 in females for regional volume and surface area phenotypes; between-sex genetic correlations that are significantly below 1 in the insula and parietal cortex; and, a male-specific effect common variant mapping to RBFOX1 - a gene linked to multiple male-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. This work suggests that common variant influences on human brain anatomy are largely consistent between males and females, with a few exceptions that will guide future research as biobanks continue to grow in size.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnxiety disorders are the most frequent mental comorbidity in people with functional GI difficulties, and abdominal discomfort is one of the most known physical signs of sadness. Successful top-down treatments using antidepressants and psychosocial therapies in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) further define personality illnesses as more than merely CNS disorders, but disorders with highly extensive systemic interconnections.

Therefore, we recently conducted a systematic review of the observational literature comparing the gut microbiota composition of persons with personality difficulties with healthy control.

MethodsThis review was written according to the guidelines established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Not a single rule was broken, yet a more thorough search strategy did provide more relevant results. Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, etc. were searched thoroughly using the phrases &#34;gut microbiota, psychological disorders, personality disorders, composition, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, etc.&#34;

ResultsResearchers did discover widespread differences in the gut microbiota of patients and controls under each category of personality disorder. They also found that there are distinct bacterial taxa that had differing abundances in patients with these three psychiatric illnesses compared to healthy controls. They found a great deal of variation in study designs and reporting, such as in the inclusion and exclusion of study populations, sampling feces for study of gut microbiota; taking into account or adjusting for important factors known to impact gut microbiota composition; storing feces; processing feces; analyzing feces.

ConclusionOur systematic review did find that psychological disorders appeared to exhibit different overall compositional differences compared to controls. There was a general trend toward the finding of increased abundances of bacteria involved in glutamate and GABA metabolism, and lower abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria in psychological disorders</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Depressive symptoms are rising in the general population and can lead to depression years later, but the contributing factors are less known. Although the link between sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms has been reported, the predictive role of sleep on depressive symptoms severity (DSS) and the impact of anxiety and brain structure on their interrelationship at the individual subject level remain poorly understood. Methods: Here, we used 1813 participants from three population-based datasets. We applied ensemble machine learning models to assess the predictive role of sleep, anxiety, and brain structure on DSS in the primary dataset (n = 1101), then we tested the generalizability of our findings in two independent datasets. In addition, we performed a mediation analysis to identify the effect of anxiety and brain structure on the link between sleep and DSS. Results: We observed that sleep quality could predict DSS (r = 0.43, rMSE = 2.73, R2 = 0.18), and adding anxiety strengthened its prediction (r = 0.67, rMSE = 2.25, R2 = 0.45). However, brain structure (alone or along with sleep/anxiety) did not predict DSS. Importantly, out-of-cohort validations of our findings in other samples provided similar findings. Further, anxiety scores (not brain structure) could mediate the link between sleep quality and DSS. Conclusion: Taken together, poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms could predict DSS across three cohorts. We hope that our findings incentivize clinicians to consider the importance of screening and treating subjects with sleep and anxiety problems to reduce the burden of depressive symptoms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by activated neuro-immune pathways, increased physiosomatic and chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia (FF) symptoms. The most severe MDD phenotype, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), is associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and negative life events (NLEs) which induce cytokines/chemokines/growth factors.

AimsTo delineate the impact of ACE&#43;NLEs on physiosomatic and FF symptoms in first episode (FE)-MDMD, and examine whether these effects are mediated by immune profiles.

MethodsACEs, NLEs, physiosomatic and FF symptoms, and 48 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors were measured in 64 FE-MDMD patients and 32 normal controls.

ResultsPhysiosomatic, FF and gastro-intestinal symptoms belong to the same factor as depression, anxiety, melancholia, and insomnia. The first factor extracted from these seven domains is labeled the physio-affective phenome of depression. A part (59.0%) of the variance in physiosomatic symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16 and IL-8 (positively), CCL3 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (inversely correlated). A part (46.5%) of the variance in physiosomatic (59.0%) symptoms is explained by the independent effects of interleukin (IL)-16, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (positively) and combined activities of negative immunoregulatory cytokines (inversely associated). Partial Least Squares analysis shows that ACE&#43;NLEs exert a substantial influence on the physio-affective phenome which are partly mediated by an immune network composed of IL-16, CCL27, TRAIL, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and stem cell growth factor.

ConclusionsThe physiosomatic and FF symptoms of FE-MDMD are partly caused by immune-associated neurotoxicity due to T helper (Th)-1 polarization, Th-1, and M1 macrophage activation and relative lowered compensatory immunoregulatory protection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAnxiety disorders are associated with decreased heart rate variability (HRV), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

MethodsWe selected individuals with whole-genome sequencing, Fitbit, and electronic health record data (N=920; 61,333 data points) from the All of Us Research Program. Anxiety PRS were derived with PRS-CS after meta-analyzing anxiety genome-wide association studies from three major cohorts-UK Biobank, FinnGen, and the Million Veterans Program (N Total =364,550). The standard deviation of average RR intervals (SDANN) was calculated using five-minute average RR intervals over full 24-hour heart rate measurements. Antidepressant exposure was defined as an active antidepressant prescription at the time of the HRV measurement in the EHR. The associations of daily SDANN measurements with the anxiety PRS, antidepressant classes, and antidepressant substances were tested. Participants with lifetime diagnoses of cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus, and major depression were excluded in sensitivity analyses. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess potential causal effect of anxiety on SDANN.

ResultsAnxiety PRS was independently associated with reduced SDANN (beta=-0.08; p=0.003). Of the eight antidepressant medications and four classes tested, venlafaxine (beta=-0.12, p=0.002) and bupropion (beta=-0.071, p=0.01), tricyclic antidepressants (beta=-0.177, p=0.0008), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.069; p=0.0008) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (beta=-0.16; p=2x10-6) were associated with decreased SDANN. One-sample MR indicated an inverse effect of anxiety on SDANN (beta=-2.22, p=0.03).

ConclusionsAnxiety and antidepressants are independently associated with decreased HRV, and anxiety appears to exert a causal effect on HRV. Our observational findings provide novel insights into the impact of anxiety on HRV.</p>
