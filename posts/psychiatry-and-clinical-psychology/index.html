  "articleBody": " Dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on depression symptom dimensions in Parkinson's disease\nAuthors: Costello, H.; Schrag, A.; Howard, R.; Roiser, J.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.23292073\nBackgroundDepression in Parkinsons disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known. AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses. MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated \"motivation\" and \"depression\" dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures. ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.\nLSD increases sleep duration the night after microdosing\nAuthors: Allen, N.; Jeremiah, A.; Murphy, R.; Sumner, R.; Forsyth, A.; Hoeh, N.; Menkes, D.; Evans, W.; Muthukumaraswamy, S.; Sundram, F.; Roop, P.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.23291970\nMicrodosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.\nRandomized Trial of Ketamine Masked by Surgical Anesthesia in Depressed Patients\nAuthors: Lii, T. R.; Smith, A. E.; Flohr, J. R.; Okada, R. L.; Nyongesa, C. A.; Cianfichi, L. J.; Hack, L. M.; Schatzberg, A. F.; Heifets, B. D.\nScore: 366.9, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.28.23289210\nBACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials. METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([\u0026ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received. RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration. CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

O.; Hakulinen, C.; Weye, N.; Formanek, T.; McGrath, J. J.; Pedersen, C. B.; Plana-Ripoll, O.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.23291796\nBackgroundIn previous studies, null results from sibling comparison designs have been used to infer that no causal association exists between childhood family income and subsequent risk of mental disorders. The aim of our study is to replicate the findings from previous studies and propose three alternative explanations based on i) variability in income and mental health between siblings, ii) life course models, and iii) detailed descriptive statistics. MethodsWe followed a nationwide Danish cohort born from 1986 to 1996 (n = 643,814, including 404,179 siblings) from age 15 until diagnosis of severe mental disorders or censoring. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated between childhood family income and subsequent mental disorders, accompanied by comprehensive descriptive statistics and triangulation analyses that help in interpreting the findings. ResultsWe observed an association between a $15,000 increase in family income and severe mental disorders (0.78; 0.76-0.81), but the sibling comparison design showed null results (1.02; 0.94-1.11). Siblings were typically born three years apart, with a difference in monthly average income at age 14 of $496 (interquartile range: $150-$641). A pseudo-sibling cohort also indicated null results (0.93; 0.85-1.01), although siblings were not family members. Family income measured yearly demonstrated comparable estimates across ages 1-14 (from 0.67 to 0.82). ConclusionOur investigation suggests that the null associations between childhood income and mental health estimated through sibling comparison designs may be explained by the fact that siblings are close together in age and residing within the same family income environment with only minor income fluctuations. Additionally, a sibling comparison design is useful to test a critical/sensitive period, but our analyses suggest that no age posits a critical risk age for this research question. This raises caution on the current practice of relying on sibling comparison designs to estimate the association between childhood income and mental health.\nThe Role of VSL#3 in the Treatment of Fatigue and Other Symptoms in Long Covid-19 Syndrome: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Pilot Study (DELong#3)\nAuthors: Caprioli, F.; Marinoni, B.; Rimondi, A.; Bottaro, F.; Ciafardini, C.; Amoroso, C.; Muia, M.; Caridi, B.; Noviello, D.; Bandera, A.; Gori, A.; Mantero, M.; Blasi, F.; Ferrucci, R.; Facciotti, F.; Vecchi, M.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.23291986\nLong COVID, also known as Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), is a chronic condition affecting individuals who have recovered from acute COVID-19. It is currently estimated that around 65 million people worldwide suffer from Long COVID. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, exertion intolerance, neurocognitive and sensory impairment, sleep disturbance, myalgia/arthralgia, and dysautonomia. Among them fatigue has emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life and daily functioning of Long COVID patients. Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Dysbiosis persists even after several months of recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on this evidence, we carried out a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of VSL#3(R), a consortium of probiotic bacterial strains, in reducing fatigue and improving various aspects of patients well-being in patients with Long COVID syndrome. HighlightsO_LIPatients suffering from Long-COVID manifest a variety of persistent symptoms impacting daily functioning; C_LIO_LIFatigue emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life; C_LIO_LIVSL#3(R) treatment significantly reduced the Chalder Fatigue Scale scores as compared to placebo C_LIO_LIChalder Fatigue Scale scores remained significantly reduced in the treatment group 4 weeks post intervention.

I.; Simpson-Kent, I.; van Harmelen, A.-L.; Vertes, P. E.; Bullmore, E. T.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.23291420\nChildhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.\nEstimating the impact of transmitted and non-transmitted psychiatric and neurodevelopmental polygenic scores on youth emotional problems.\nAuthors: Shakeshaft, A.; Martin, J.; Dennison, C. A.; Riglin, L.; Lewis, C. M.; O'Donovan, M. C.; Thapar, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291893\nAnxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.\nThe structural covariance of reading-related brain regions in adults and children with typical reading skills and developmental dyslexia\nAuthors: Haugg, A.; Frei, N.; Lutz, C.; Di Pietro, S. V.; Karipidis, I. I.; Brem, S.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.23292169\nStructural covariance (SC) is a promising approach for investigating brain organization within the domain of literacy and developmental disorders as it thought to reflect both functional and structural information. This study presents a first-of-its-kind exploration of SC in reading- related brain regions across different ages and reading abilities. Whole-brain SC analyses were conducted for six key regions of the reading network, including an anterior and posterior subdivision of the visual word form area (VWFA). We compared SC matrices of typically reading adults (N=134) and children (N=110), and between typically reading children and children with dyslexia (N=68). Our results showed significant associations between reading-related brain regions in typically reading adults. We observed significant SC between the posterior VWFA and the left occipital cortex, and between the anterior VWFA and the left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Typical-reading adults and children did not differ significantly in SC. However, typically reading children demonstrated significantly higher SC between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and other reading-related brain regions than children with dyslexia. Our findings provide support for a functional and structural division of the VWFA and underscore the crucial role of the IPL in fluent reading.\nTest-retest reliability of a 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visual assessment of body image disturbance in anorexia nervosa\nAuthors: Ralph-Nearman, C.; Arevian, A. C.; Karem, A.; Llano-Rios, T. F.; Sinik, M.; Moseman, S.; Feusner, J. D.; Khalsa, S. S.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.23291397\nBody image disturbance (BID) is a diagnostic feature of anorexia nervosa (AN), with few reliable, unbiased visual markers. We examined test-retest reliability of Somatomap, a 2-dimensional(2D) and 3-dimensional(3D) digital assessment of BID. Fifty-nine AN inpatients performed test-retest by a) outlining body concern areas on a 2D avatar; and b) using sliders to sculpt 23 independent body parts on a randomized 3D avatar to reflect their current body. Corresponding body parts were measured to calculate discrepancy scores (i.e., 3D perceived minus measured values). Regional 2D BID test-retest differences were evaluated using z-scores to generate statistical body maps. Test-retest 3D assessment reliability was evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for individual and aggregated body parts. Somatomap 2D demonstrated no statistical differences between test-retest, suggesting excellent test-retest reliability. All 23 body parts on Somatomap 3D demonstrated statistically significant fair-to-excellent test-retest reliability in AN. Regions that are commonly of concern in AN, and combined measures, showed the highest reliability. Somatomap 2D and 3D may provide a reliable perceptual marker of visual BID in AN.\nInstability in longitudinal sleep duration predicts cognitive impairment in aged participants of the Seattle Longitudinal Study\nAuthors: Keil, S. A.; Schindler, A.; Wang, M. X.; Piantino, J.; Silbert, L. C.; Elliott, J. E.; Lim, M.; Thomas, R. G.; Willis, S.; Iliff, J. J.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.23291098\nImportance. Sleep disturbances and clinical sleep disorders are associated with all-cause dementia and neurodegenerative conditions. It remains unclear how longitudinal changes in sleep impact the incidence of cognitive impairment. Objective. To evaluate how longitudinal sleep patterns contribute to age-related changes in cognitive function in healthy adults. Design, Setting, Participants. This study utilizes retrospective longitudinal analyses of a community-based study within Seattle, evaluating self-reported sleep (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in aged adults. Main Outcomes and Measures. The main outcome is cognitive impairment as defined by sub-threshold performance on 2 of 4 neuropsychological batteries: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Trail Making Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale (Revised). Sleep duration was defined through self-report of average nightly sleep duration over the last week and assessed longitudinally. Median sleep duration, change in sleep duration (slope), variability in sleep duration (standard deviation, Sleep Variability), and sleep phenotype (\"Short Sleep\" median [\u0026le;]7hrs.; \"Medium Sleep\" median = 7hrs; \"Long Sleep\" median [\u0026ge;]7hrs.). Results. A total of 822 individuals (mean age of 76.2 years [11.8]; 466 women [56.7%]; 216 APOE allele positive [26.3%]) were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression model (concordance 0.70) showed that increased Sleep Variability (95% CI [1.27,3.86]) was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. Further analysis using linear regression prediction analysis (R2=0.201, F (10, 168)=6.010, p=2.67E-07) showed that high Sleep Variability ({beta}=0.3491; p=0.048) was a significant predictor of cognitive impairment over a 10-year period. Conclusions and Relevance. High variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment and predictive of decline in cognitive performance ten years later. These data highlight that instability in longitudinal sleep duration may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundDepression in Parkinsons disease (PD) is common, disabling and responds poorly to standard antidepressant medication. Motivational symptoms of depression, such as apathy and anhedonia, are particularly prevalent in depression in PD and predict poor response to antidepressant treatment. Loss of dopaminergic innervation of the striatum is associated with emergence of motivational symptoms in PD, and mood fluctuations correlate with dopamine availability. Accordingly, optimising dopaminergic treatment for PD can improve depressive symptoms, and dopamine agonists have shown promising effects in improving apathy. However, the differential effect of antiparkinsonian medication on symptom dimensions of depression is not known.

AimsWe hypothesised that there would be dissociable effects of dopaminergic medications on different depression symptom dimensions. We predicted that dopaminergic medication would specifically improve motivational symptoms, but not other symptoms, of depression. We also hypothesised that antidepressant effects of dopaminergic medications with mechanisms of action reliant on pre-synaptic dopamine neuron integrity would attenuate as pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurodegeneration progresses.

MethodsWe analysed data from a longitudinal study of 412 newly diagnosed PD patients followed over five years in the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Medication state for individual classes of Parkinsons medications was recorded annually. Previously validated &#34;motivation&#34; and &#34;depression&#34; dimensions were derived from the 15-item geriatric depression scale. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration was measured using repeated striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging.

ResultsLinear mixed-effects modelling was performed across all simultaneously acquired data points. Dopamine agonist use was associated with relatively fewer motivation symptoms as time progressed (interaction: {beta}=-0.07, 95%CI [-0.13,-0.01], p=0.015) but had no effect on the depression symptom dimension (p=0.6). In contrast, monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor use was associated with relatively fewer depression symptoms across all years ({beta}=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.81,-0.01], p=0.047). No associations were observed between either depression or motivation symptoms and levodopa or amantadine use. There was a significant interaction between striatal DAT binding and MAO-B inhibitor use on motivation symptoms: MAO-B inhibitor use was associated with lower motivation symptoms in patients with higher striatal DAT binding (interaction: {beta}=-0.24, 95%CI [-0.43,-0.05], p=0.012). No other medication effects were moderated by striatal DAT binding measures.

ConclusionsWe identified dissociable associations between dopaminergic medications and different dimensions of depression in PD. Dopamine agonists may be effective for treatment of motivational symptoms of depression. In contrast, MAO-B inhibitors may improve both depressive and motivation symptoms, albeit the latter effect appears to be attenuated in patients with more severe striatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, which may be a consequence of dependence on pre-synaptic dopaminergic neuron integrity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microdosing psychedelic drugs, at a level below the threshold to induce hallucinations, is an increasingly common lifestyle practise. However, the effects of microdosing on sleep have not been previously reported. Here we report results from a Phase 1 randomised controlled trial in which 80 healthy adult male volunteers received a six week course of either LSD (10 {micro}g) or placebo with doses self-administered every third day. Participants used a commercially available sleep/activity tracker for the duration of the trial. Data from 3231 nights of sleep showed that on the night after microdosing participants in the LSD group slept an extra 24.3 minutes per night (95% Confidence Interval 10.3 - 38.3 minutes) compared to placebo - with no reductions of sleep observed on the dosing day itself. There were no changes in the proportion of time spent in various sleep stages or in participant physical activity. These results show clear modification of the physiological sleep requirements in healthy volunteers who microdose, and may have implications for the proposed therapeutic effects of microdosing in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder where sleep is frequently disturbed. The clear, clinically significant, changes in objective measurements of sleep observed are difficult to explain as a placebo effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDKetamine may have antidepressant properties, but its acute psychoactive effects complicate successful masking in placebo-controlled trials.

METHODSIn a triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 40 adult patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) during anesthesia as usual for routine surgery. The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. The secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical response ([&amp;ge;]50% reduction in MADRS scores) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-infusion. After all follow-up visits, participants were asked to guess which intervention they received.

RESULTSMean MADRS scores did not differ between groups at screening or pre-infusion baseline. The mixed-effects model showed no evidence of effect of group assignment on post-infusion MADRS scores at 1 to 3 days post-infusion (-5.82, 95% CI -13.3 to 1.64, p=0.13). Clinical response rates were similar between groups (60% versus 50% on day 1) and comparable to previous studies of ketamine in depressed populations. Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not find statistical separation of ketamine from placebo. 36.8% of participants guessed their treatment assignment correctly; both groups allocated their guesses in similar proportions. One serious adverse event occurred in each group, unrelated to ketamine administration.

CONCLUSIONIn adults with major depressive disorder, a single dose of intravenous ketamine delivered during surgical anesthesia had no greater effect than placebo in acutely reducing the severity of depressive symptoms. This trial successfully masked treatment allocation in moderate-to-severely depressed patients using surgical anesthesia. While it is impractical to use surgical anesthesia for most placebo-controlled trials, future studies of novel antidepressants with acute psychoactive effects should make efforts to fully mask treatment assignment in order to minimize subject-expectancy bias.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn previous studies, null results from sibling comparison designs have been used to infer that no causal association exists between childhood family income and subsequent risk of mental disorders. The aim of our study is to replicate the findings from previous studies and propose three alternative explanations based on i) variability in income and mental health between siblings, ii) life course models, and iii) detailed descriptive statistics.

MethodsWe followed a nationwide Danish cohort born from 1986 to 1996 (n = 643,814, including 404,179 siblings) from age 15 until diagnosis of severe mental disorders or censoring. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated between childhood family income and subsequent mental disorders, accompanied by comprehensive descriptive statistics and triangulation analyses that help in interpreting the findings.

ResultsWe observed an association between a $15,000 increase in family income and severe mental disorders (0.78; 0.76-0.81), but the sibling comparison design showed null results (1.02; 0.94-1.11). Siblings were typically born three years apart, with a difference in monthly average income at age 14 of $496 (interquartile range: $150-$641). A pseudo-sibling cohort also indicated null results (0.93; 0.85-1.01), although siblings were not family members. Family income measured yearly demonstrated comparable estimates across ages 1-14 (from 0.67 to 0.82).

ConclusionOur investigation suggests that the null associations between childhood income and mental health estimated through sibling comparison designs may be explained by the fact that siblings are close together in age and residing within the same family income environment with only minor income fluctuations. Additionally, a sibling comparison design is useful to test a critical/sensitive period, but our analyses suggest that no age posits a critical risk age for this research question. This raises caution on the current practice of relying on sibling comparison designs to estimate the association between childhood income and mental health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long COVID, also known as Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), is a chronic condition affecting individuals who have recovered from acute COVID-19. It is currently estimated that around 65 million people worldwide suffer from Long COVID. It is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fatigue, exertion intolerance, neurocognitive and sensory impairment, sleep disturbance, myalgia/arthralgia, and dysautonomia. Among them fatigue has emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life and daily functioning of Long COVID patients. Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota has been reported in COVID-19 patients. Dysbiosis persists even after several months of recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Based on this evidence, we carried out a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy of VSL#3(R), a consortium of probiotic bacterial strains, in reducing fatigue and improving various aspects of patients well-being in patients with Long COVID syndrome.

HighlightsO_LIPatients suffering from Long-COVID manifest a variety of persistent symptoms impacting daily functioning;
C_LIO_LIFatigue emerged as a burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life;
C_LIO_LIVSL#3(R) treatment significantly reduced the Chalder Fatigue Scale scores as compared to placebo

        <p class="abstract">Childhood maltreatment (CM) leads to a lifelong susceptibility to mental ill-health which might be reflected by its effects on adult brain structure, perhaps indirectly mediated by its effects on adult metabolic, immune, and psychosocial systems. Indexing these systemic factors via body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP) and rates of adult trauma (AT), respectively, we tested three hypotheses: (H1) CM has direct or indirect causal effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP; (H2) adult trauma, BMI and CRP are all independently related to adult brain structure; and (H3) effects of CM on adult brain structure are mediated by its effects on adult trauma, BMI and CRP. Using path analysis and data from N=116,887 participants in UK Biobank we find that CM is related to greater BMI and AT levels, and that only these two variables mediate CMs effects on CRP [H1]. Regression analyses on the UKB MRI sub-sample (N=21,738) revealed that greater CRP and BMI were both related to a spatially convergent pattern of cortical effects (Spearmans{rho} =0.87) characterised by fronto-occipital increases and temporo-parietal reductions in thickness, and that AT is related to lower subcortical volumes [H2]. Finally, path models indicated that CM has indirect effects in a subset of brain regions through its influence on BMI, CRP and AT [H3]. Results provide evidence that childhood maltreatment can influence brain structure decades after exposure by increasing individual risk towards adult trauma, obesity or inflammation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anxiety and depression (emotional disorders) are familial and heritable, especially when onset is early. However, other cross-generational studies suggest transmission of youth emotional problems is explained by mainly environmental risks. We set out to test the contribution of parental non-transmitted genetic liability, as indexed by psychiatric/neurodevelopmental common polygenic liability, to youth emotional problems using a UK population-based cohort: the Millennium Cohort Study. European (N=6,328) and South Asian (N=814) ancestries were included, as well as a subset with genomic data from both parents (European: N=2,809; South Asian: N=254). We examined the association of transmitted (PGST) and non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSNT) for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], schizophrenia) with youth emotional disorder and symptom scores, measured using the parent-and self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional subscale at 6 timepoints between ages 3-17 years. In the European sample, PGST for anxiety and depression, but not bipolar disorder, were associated with emotional disorder and symptom scores across all ages, except age 3, with strongest association in adolescence. ADHD and ASD PGST also showed association across ages 11-17 years. In the South Asian sample, evidence for associations between all PGST and outcome measures were weaker. There was weak evidence of association between PGSNT for anxiety and depression and age 17 symptom scores in the South Asian sample, but not in the European sample for any outcome. Overall, PGST for depression, anxiety, ADHD and ASD contributed to youth emotional problems, with stronger associations in adolescence. There was limited support for non-transmitted genetic effects: these findings do not support the hypothesis that parental polygenic psychiatric/neurodevelopmental liability confer risk to offspring emotional problems through non-transmitted rearing/nurture effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Structural covariance (SC) is a promising approach for investigating brain organization within the domain of literacy and developmental disorders as it thought to reflect both functional and structural information. This study presents a first-of-its-kind exploration of SC in reading- related brain regions across different ages and reading abilities. Whole-brain SC analyses were conducted for six key regions of the reading network, including an anterior and posterior subdivision of the visual word form area (VWFA). We compared SC matrices of typically reading adults (N=134) and children (N=110), and between typically reading children and children with dyslexia (N=68). Our results showed significant associations between reading-related brain regions in typically reading adults. We observed significant SC between the posterior VWFA and the left occipital cortex, and between the anterior VWFA and the left superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus. Typical-reading adults and children did not differ significantly in SC. However, typically reading children demonstrated significantly higher SC between the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and other reading-related brain regions than children with dyslexia. Our findings provide support for a functional and structural division of the VWFA and underscore the crucial role of the IPL in fluent reading.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Body image disturbance (BID) is a diagnostic feature of anorexia nervosa (AN), with few reliable, unbiased visual markers. We examined test-retest reliability of Somatomap, a 2-dimensional(2D) and 3-dimensional(3D) digital assessment of BID. Fifty-nine AN inpatients performed test-retest by a) outlining body concern areas on a 2D avatar; and b) using sliders to sculpt 23 independent body parts on a randomized 3D avatar to reflect their current body. Corresponding body parts were measured to calculate discrepancy scores (i.e., 3D perceived minus measured values). Regional 2D BID test-retest differences were evaluated using z-scores to generate statistical body maps. Test-retest 3D assessment reliability was evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for individual and aggregated body parts. Somatomap 2D demonstrated no statistical differences between test-retest, suggesting excellent test-retest reliability. All 23 body parts on Somatomap 3D demonstrated statistically significant fair-to-excellent test-retest reliability in AN. Regions that are commonly of concern in AN, and combined measures, showed the highest reliability. Somatomap 2D and 3D may provide a reliable perceptual marker of visual BID in AN.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Importance. Sleep disturbances and clinical sleep disorders are associated with all-cause dementia and neurodegenerative conditions. It remains unclear how longitudinal changes in sleep impact the incidence of cognitive impairment.

Objective. To evaluate how longitudinal sleep patterns contribute to age-related changes in cognitive function in healthy adults.

Design, Setting, Participants. This study utilizes retrospective longitudinal analyses of a community-based study within Seattle, evaluating self-reported sleep (1993-2012) and cognitive performance (1997-2020) in aged adults.

Main Outcomes and Measures. The main outcome is cognitive impairment as defined by sub-threshold performance on 2 of 4 neuropsychological batteries: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Trail Making Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale (Revised). Sleep duration was defined through self-report of  average nightly sleep duration over the last week and assessed longitudinally. Median sleep duration, change in sleep duration (slope), variability in sleep duration (standard deviation, Sleep Variability), and sleep phenotype (&#34;Short Sleep&#34; median [&amp;le;]7hrs.; &#34;Medium Sleep&#34; median = 7hrs; &#34;Long Sleep&#34; median [&amp;ge;]7hrs.).

Results. A total of 822 individuals (mean age of 76.2 years [11.8]; 466 women [56.7%]; 216 APOE allele positive [26.3%]) were included in the study. Analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression model (concordance 0.70) showed that increased Sleep Variability (95% CI [1.27,3.86]) was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment. Further analysis using linear regression prediction analysis (R2=0.201, F (10, 168)=6.010, p=2.67E-07) showed that high Sleep Variability ({beta}=0.3491; p=0.048) was a significant predictor of cognitive impairment over a 10-year period.

Conclusions and Relevance. High variability in longitudinal sleep duration was significantly associated with the incidence of cognitive impairment and predictive of decline in cognitive performance ten years later. These data highlight that instability in longitudinal sleep duration may contribute to age-related cognitive decline.</p>
