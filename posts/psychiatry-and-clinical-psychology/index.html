Objectives: To examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, +{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. Methods: IgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. Results: Long COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. Conclusion: Brain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.\nGeometry of navigation identifies genetic-risk and clinical Alzheimer's disease\nAuthors: Lim, U.; Leal-Cervantes, R.; Coughlan, G.; Lambiotte, R.; Spiers, H.; Hornberger, M.; Harrington, H.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.23296035\nRecent research evidence demonstrates that the inability to orient oneself and navigate space is an early indicator of Alzheimers Disease. The video game Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) was designed to assess the players navigation ability, and several research works analysed the SHQ data using simple metrics such as length and time of navigation paths. Expanding these analyses, we propose new performance metrics that capture the geometry of paths, and analyse datasets of more than 60,000 navigators. The metrics identify players who failed the navigation task, the dementia patients, and carriers of the at-risk allele of the Apolipoprotein-E [APOE]. Furthermore the metrics detect weak navigation ability when only a fraction of navigation paths are used, with superior performance to baseline methods. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed performance metrics pave the way to a comprehensive pre-clinical screening toolbox for Alzheimers Disease. TEASERWe propose geometric methods to capture decline in navigation ability from dementia.\nNon-invasive vagus nerve stimulation conditions increased invigoration and wanting in depression\nAuthors: Ferstl, M. S.; Kuehnel, A.; Klaus, J.; Lin, W. M.; Kroemer, N. B.\nScore: 18.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296284\nBackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is often marked by impaired motivation and reward processing, known as anhedonia. Many patients do not respond to first-line treatments, and improvements in motivation can be slow, creating an urgent need for rapid interventions. Recently, we demonstrated that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) acutely boosts effort invigoration in healthy participants, but its effects on depression remain unclear. ObjectiveTo assess the impact of taVNS on effort invigoration and maintenance in a sample that includes patients with MDD, evaluating the generalizability of our findings. MethodsWe used a single-blind, randomized crossover design in 30 patients with MDD and 29 matched (age, sex, and BMI) healthy control participants (HCP). ResultsConsistent with prior findings, taVNS increased effort invigoration for rewards in both groups during Session 1 (p=.040), particularly for less wanted rewards in HCP (pboot\u003c.001). However, invigoration remained elevated in all participants, and no acute changes were observed in Session 2 ({Delta}invigoration=3.52, p=.093). Crucially, throughout Session 1, we found taVNS-induced increases in effort invigoration (pboot =.008) and wanting (pboot=.010) in patients with MDD, with gains in wanting maintained across sessions ({Delta}wanting=0.06, p=.97). ConclusionsOur study replicates the invigorating effects of taVNS in Session 1 and reveals its generalizability to depression. Furthermore, we expand upon previous research by showing taVNS-induced conditioning effects on invigoration and wanting within Session 1 in patients that were largely sustained. While enduring motivational improvements present challenges for crossover designs, they are highly desirable in interventions and warrant further follow-up research.

However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.\nStructural neurodevelopment at the individual level - life-course investigation using ABCD, IMAGEN and UK Biobank data\nAuthors: Shi, R.; Xiang, S.; Jia, T.; Robbins, T.; Kang, J.; Schumann, G.; lin, x.; Sahakian, B.; Feng, J.; IMAGEN Consortium, Score: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295841\nAdolescents exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in the structural architecture of brain development. However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, existing research has largely focused on population averages and the neurobiological basis underlying individual heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging from the IMAGEN cohort (n=1,543), we show that adolescents can be clustered into three groups defined by distinct developmental patterns of whole-brain gray matter volume (GMV). Genetic and epigenetic determinants of group clustering and long-term impacts of neurodevelopment in mid-to-late adulthood were investigated using data from the ABCD, IMAGEN and UK Biobank cohorts. Group 1, characterized by continuously decreasing GMV, showed generally the best neurocognitive performances during adolescence. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 exhibited a slower rate of GMV decrease and worsened neurocognitive development, which was associated with epigenetic changes and greater environmental burden. Further, Group 3 showed increasing GMV and delayed neurocognitive development during adolescence due to a genetic variation, while these disadvantages were attenuated in mid-to-late adulthood. In summary, our study revealed novel clusters of adolescent structural neurodevelopment and suggested that genetically-predicted delayed neurodevelopment has limited long-term effects on mental well-being and socio-economic outcomes later in life. Our results could inform future research on policy interventions aimed at reducing the financial and emotional burden of mental illness.\nGenetic neurodevelopmental clustering and dyslexia\nAuthors: Ciulkinyte, A.; Mountford, H. S.; Fontanillas, P.; 23andMe Research Team, ; Bates, T. C.; Martin, N.; Fisher, S. E.; Luciano, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296530\nDyslexia is a learning difficulty with neurodevelopmental origins, manifesting as reduced accuracy and speed in reading and spelling despite adequate education. Dyslexia is substantially heritable and frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this paper was to elucidate how genetic factors predisposing to dyslexia correlate with risk for other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dyslexia diagnosis self-report (51,800 cases and ~1.1 million controls), together with GWAS of ADHD, autism, Tourette syndrome, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia, were analysed using Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to construct a genomic structural model. The final model consisted of five correlated latent genomic factors described as F1) internalising disorders, F2) psychotic disorders, F3) compulsive disorders, F4) neurodevelopmental conditions, and F5) attention and learning difficulties, which includes ADHD and dyslexia. This latent factor was moderately correlated with internalising disorders (.40) and, to a lesser extent, with neurodevelopmental conditions (.25) and psychotic disorders (.17), and negatively with compulsive disorders (-.16). Unlike ADHD, most of the genomic variance in dyslexia was unique, suggesting a more peripheral relation to psychiatric traits. We further investigated genetic variants underlying both dyslexia and ADHD. This implicated 49 loci (40 of which were not reported in GWAS of the individual traits) mapping to 174 genes (121 not found in GWAS of individual traits). Our study has discovered novel pleiotropic variants and confirms via GenomicSEM the heightened genetic relation between dyslexia and ADHD versus other psychiatric traits. In future, analyses including additional co-occurring traits such as dyscalculia and dyspraxia, for which there are currently no large-scale GWAS, will allow a more clear definition of the attention and learning difficulties genomic factor, yielding further insights into factor structure and pleiotropic effects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Autoimmune responses contribute to the pathophysiology of Long COVID, affective symptoms and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Objectives: To examine whether Long COVID, and its accompanying affective symptoms and CFS are associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)A/IgM/IgG directed at neuronal proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), synapsin, &#43;{beta}-tubulin, neurofilament protein (NFP), cerebellar protein-2 (CP2), and the blood-brain-barrier-brain-damage (BBD) proteins claudin-5 and S100B. Methods: IgA/IgM/IgG to the above neuronal proteins, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were measured in 90 Long COVID patients and 90 healthy controls, while C-reactive protein (CRP), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in association with affective and CFS ratings were additionally assessed in a subgroup thereof. Results: Long COVID is associated with significant increases in IgG directed at tubulin (IgG-tubulin), MBP, MOG and synapsin; IgM-MBP, MOG, CP2, synapsin and BBD; and IgA-CP2 and synapsin. IgM-SARS-CoV-2 and IgM-HHV-6 antibody titers were significantly correlated with IgA/IgG/IgM-tubulin and -CP2, IgG/IgM-BBD, IgM-MOG, IgA/IgM-NFP, and IgG/IgM-synapsin. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that IgM-MBP and IgG-MBP are the best predictors of Long COVID. Multiple regression analysis shows that IgG-MOG, CRP and AOPP explain together 41.7% of the variance in the severity of CFS. Neural network analysis shows that IgM-synapsin, IgA-MBP, IgG-MOG, IgA-synapsin, IgA-CP2, IgG-MBP and CRP are the most important predictors of affective symptoms due to Long COVID with a predictive accuracy of r=0.801. Conclusion: Brain-targeted autoimmunity contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of Long COVID and the severity of its physio-affective phenome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent research evidence demonstrates that the inability to orient oneself and navigate space is an early indicator of Alzheimers Disease. The video game Sea Hero Quest (SHQ) was designed to assess the players navigation ability, and several research works analysed the SHQ data using simple metrics such as length and time of navigation paths. Expanding these analyses, we propose new performance metrics that capture the geometry of paths, and analyse datasets of more than 60,000 navigators. The metrics identify players who failed the navigation task, the dementia patients, and carriers of the at-risk allele of the Apolipoprotein-E [APOE]. Furthermore the metrics detect weak navigation ability when only a fraction of navigation paths are used, with superior performance to baseline methods. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed performance metrics pave the way to a comprehensive pre-clinical screening toolbox for Alzheimers Disease.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is often marked by impaired motivation and reward processing, known as anhedonia. Many patients do not respond to first-line treatments, and improvements in motivation can be slow, creating an urgent need for rapid interventions. Recently, we demonstrated that transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) acutely boosts effort invigoration in healthy participants, but its effects on depression remain unclear.

ObjectiveTo assess the impact of taVNS on effort invigoration and maintenance in a sample that includes patients with MDD, evaluating the generalizability of our findings.

MethodsWe used a single-blind, randomized crossover design in 30 patients with MDD and 29 matched (age, sex, and BMI) healthy control participants (HCP).

ResultsConsistent with prior findings, taVNS increased effort invigoration for rewards in both groups during Session 1 (p=.040), particularly for less wanted rewards in HCP (pboot&lt;.001). However, invigoration remained elevated in all participants, and no acute changes were observed in Session 2 ({Delta}invigoration=3.52, p=.093). Crucially, throughout Session 1, we found taVNS-induced increases in effort invigoration (pboot =.008) and wanting (pboot=.010) in patients with MDD, with gains in wanting maintained across sessions ({Delta}wanting=0.06, p=.97).

ConclusionsOur study replicates the invigorating effects of taVNS in Session 1 and reveals its generalizability to depression. Furthermore, we expand upon previous research by showing taVNS-induced conditioning effects on invigoration and wanting within Session 1 in patients that were largely sustained. While enduring motivational improvements present challenges for crossover designs, they are highly desirable in interventions and warrant further follow-up research.

        <p class="abstract">Non-coding variants increase risk of neuropsychiatric disease. However, our understanding of the cell-type specific role of the non-coding genome in disease is incomplete. We performed population scale (N=1,393) chromatin accessibility profiling of neurons and non-neurons from two neocortical brain regions: the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across both regions, we observed notable differences in neuronal chromatin accessibility between schizophrenia cases and controls. A per-sample disease pseudotime was positively associated with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Organizing chromatin into cis- and trans-regulatory domains, identified a prominent neuronal trans-regulatory domain (TRD1) active in immature glutamatergic neurons during fetal development. Polygenic risk score analysis using genetic variants within chromatin accessibility of TRD1 successfully predicted susceptibility to schizophrenia in the Million Veteran Program cohort. Overall, we present the most extensive resource to date of chromatin accessibility in the human cortex, yielding insights into the cell-type specific etiology of schizophrenia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adolescents exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in the structural architecture of brain development. However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, existing research has largely focused on population averages and the neurobiological basis underlying individual heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging from the IMAGEN cohort (n=1,543), we show that adolescents can be clustered into three groups defined by distinct developmental patterns of whole-brain gray matter volume (GMV). Genetic and epigenetic determinants of group clustering and long-term impacts of neurodevelopment in mid-to-late adulthood were investigated using data from the ABCD, IMAGEN and UK Biobank cohorts. Group 1, characterized by continuously decreasing GMV, showed generally the best neurocognitive performances during adolescence. Compared to Group 1, Group 2 exhibited a slower rate of GMV decrease and worsened neurocognitive development, which was associated with epigenetic changes and greater environmental burden. Further, Group 3 showed increasing GMV and delayed neurocognitive development during adolescence due to a genetic variation, while these disadvantages were attenuated in mid-to-late adulthood. In summary, our study revealed novel clusters of adolescent structural neurodevelopment and suggested that genetically-predicted delayed neurodevelopment has limited long-term effects on mental well-being and socio-economic outcomes later in life. Our results could inform future research on policy interventions aimed at reducing the financial and emotional burden of mental illness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dyslexia is a learning difficulty with neurodevelopmental origins, manifesting as reduced accuracy and speed in reading and spelling despite adequate education. Dyslexia is substantially heritable and frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The purpose of this paper was to elucidate how genetic factors predisposing to dyslexia correlate with risk for other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits. A large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dyslexia diagnosis self-report (51,800 cases and ~1.1 million controls), together with GWAS of ADHD, autism, Tourette syndrome, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia, were analysed using Genomic Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to construct a genomic structural model. The final model consisted of five correlated latent genomic factors described as F1) internalising disorders, F2) psychotic disorders, F3) compulsive disorders, F4) neurodevelopmental conditions, and F5) attention and learning difficulties, which includes ADHD and dyslexia. This latent factor was moderately correlated with internalising disorders (.40) and, to a lesser extent, with neurodevelopmental conditions (.25) and psychotic disorders (.17), and negatively with compulsive disorders (-.16). Unlike ADHD, most of the genomic variance in dyslexia was unique, suggesting a more peripheral relation to psychiatric traits. We further investigated genetic variants underlying both dyslexia and ADHD. This implicated 49 loci (40 of which were not reported in GWAS of the individual traits) mapping to 174 genes (121 not found in GWAS of individual traits). Our study has discovered novel pleiotropic variants and confirms via GenomicSEM the heightened genetic relation between dyslexia and ADHD versus other psychiatric traits. In future, analyses including additional co-occurring traits such as dyscalculia and dyspraxia, for which there are currently no large-scale GWAS, will allow a more clear definition of the attention and learning difficulties genomic factor, yielding further insights into factor structure and pleiotropic effects.</p>
