O.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301153\nOnly recently have human postmortem brain studies of differential gene expression (DGE) associated with opioid overdose death (OOD) been published; sample sizes from these studies have been modest (N = 40-153). To increase statistical power to identify OOD-associated genes, we leveraged human prefrontal cortex RNAseq data from four independent OOD studies and conducted a transcriptome-wide DGE meta-analysis (N = 285). Using a unified gene expression data processing and analysis framework across studies, we meta-analyzed 20LJ098 genes and found 335 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by OOD status (false discovery rate \u003c 0.05). Of these, 66 DEGs were among the list of 303 genes reported as OOD-associated in prior prefrontal cortex molecular studies, including genes/gene families (e.g., OPRK1, NPAS4, DUSP, EGR). The remaining 269 DEGs were not previously reported (e.g., NR4A2, SYT1, HCRTR2, BDNF). There was little evidence of genetic drivers for the observed differences in gene expression between opioid addiction cases and controls. Enrichment analyses for the DEGs across molecular pathway and biological process databases highlight an interconnected set of genes and pathways from orexin and tyrosine kinase receptors through MEK/ERK/MAPK signaling to affect neuronal plasticity.\nPrevalence of Substance Use and related Behaviors among Tertiary Students: A Cross-sectional Survey in Yaounde, Cameroon\nAuthors: Edzamba, M. F.; Lekeumo Cheuyem, F. Z.; Amani, A.; Mossus, T.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301042\nBackgroundThe use of psychoactive substances is a major global public health problem. People aged 15-24 years are more likely to abuse psychoactive substances than the general population. Substances use among youth, especially students in higher education is increasing rapidly worldwide. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of substances use among university students and to describe their behavioral profiles. MethodsAn institutional-based descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2023 at the Yaounde 1 University in Cameroon. A convenience non probabilistic sampling method were used to recruit consenting students. The data collectors were medical students who were trained for 2 days and given appropriate instructions before the survey. The data collected were reviewed and checked for completeness before being entered. All data were coded and entered into Microsoft Excel 2016. Descriptive statistics were performed using R Statistics 4.3.1. Qualitative data were collected from all participants through interviews. ResultsA total of 191 university students were enrolled in the study. The median age was 20 years. They were predominantly male (66.5%) and aged between 20-25. The prevalence of substance use was 66% for alcohol consumption, 33.5% for smoking habits and 26.7% for drug use. The main motivations for substance use were companionship, thrill-seeking and curiosity. More than a third of students were polysubstance users (35.1%). Most participants were aware of the academic consequence (85.9%) and almost all (93.7%) acknowledged the physical and psycho-social consequences of substance use. ConclusionThere is a high rate of psychoactive substance use among university students. Therefore, effective campus-based counseling, peer education, and national surveillance systems that can monitor risky behaviors among university students should be implemented.\n",
