ObjectivesSubstance use disorder has been associated with increased morbidity in COVID-19 infection. However, less is known about the impact of active substance use and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) on COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of substance use, namely cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, sedative and opioid use as well as buprenorphine or methadone = on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.">

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of substance use, namely cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, sedative and opioid use as well as buprenorphine or methadone = on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. MethodsUsing electronic-health record data at a large urban hospital system, patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 were included. Substance use was identified from urine toxicology and MOUD prescriptions within 90 days prior to admission. COVID-19 outcomes included mortality, ICU admission, need for ventilatory support, number and duration of hospitalizations. Multivariable logistic regression was performed controlling for variables such as age, sex, medical comorbidity, tobacco use, and social disadvantage. ResultsAmong COVID-19 positive patients (n=17,423), sedative, cannabis, cocaine, and opioid use was associated with statistically significant increases in need for ICU care, need for ventilatory support, number of hospitalizations and duration of hospitalization. Substance use was not associated with an increase in all-cause mortality. There were no statistically significant differences between methadone, buprenorphine and other opioids on COVID-19 outcomes. ConclusionsActive substance use were associated with increased morbidity in COVID-19 infection. MOUD was not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to OUD. Future studies focused on MOUD treatments that reduce morbidity may help improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19.\n",
