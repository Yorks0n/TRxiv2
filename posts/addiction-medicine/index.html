ResultsRates of hallucinogen associated ED visits increased by 69% between 2016 and 2021 compared to a 24% decrease and 1.9% decrease in rates of alcohol associated and cannabis associated ED visits respectively. Rates of hallucinogen associated hospitalizations increased by 74% compared to a 11% increase in alcohol associated hospitalizations and a 19% increase in cannabis associated hospitalizations. ConclusionsThe large relative, but small absolute, increase in hallucinogen associated ED visits and hospitalizations is concerning given changing public perception and increasing use of these substances. The categorization of a large number of compounds as hallucinogens limits our ability to understand trends in harms with ICD-10 codes. Improved systems for surveillance of potential harms of hallucinogen use are needed.\nVirtual transitional pain service delivered via telehealth is effective in preventing new and persistent opioid use amongst post-surgical spine patients\nAuthors: Hussain, M.; Norgeot, B.; Zaafran, A.; Stark, J.; Caridi, J.; Fenoy, A.; Pivalizza, E.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294272\nOpioid dependence is a national crisis, with 30 million patients annually at risk of becoming persistent opioid users after receiving opioids for post-surgical pain management. Translational Pain Services (TPS) demonstrate effectiveness for behavioral health improvements but its effectiveness in preventing persistent opioid use is less established, especially amongst opioid exposed patients. Prohibitive costs and accessibility challenges have hindered TPS program adoption. To address these limitations, we designed and implemented a remote telehealth TPS protocol focusing on preventing continued opioid use while improving behavioral health. Licensed therapists trained in the opioid-tapering CBT protocol delivered sessions reimbursed through standard payer reimbursement. Our prospective study evaluated the protocols effectiveness on preventing persistent opioid use and behavioral health outcomes amongst both opioid naive and exposed patients. In an opioid-naive patient cohort (n=67), 100% completely tapered off opioids, while in an opioid-exposed cohort (n =19) 52% completely tapered off opioids, demonstrating promising results. In both cohorts, we observed significant improvements in behavioral health scores, including pain. This opioid-tapering digital TPS is effective, adoptable, and incurs no out-of-pocket cost for healthcare systems. We provide the opioid-tapering CBT protocol in the supplement to facilitate adoption.

M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23289383\nOur aim was to evaluate whether alcohol use is associated with changes in the circulating metabolite profile similar to those present in persons with depression. If so, these findings could partially explain the link between alcohol use and depression. We applied a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the non-depressed general population (GP) (n = 247) and a cohort of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 99). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of hippuric acid in the GP cohort. In the GP cohort, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the MDD cohort, but in these individuals it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of hippuric acid suggest that already moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and depression.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Our aim was to evaluate whether alcohol use is associated with changes in the circulating metabolite profile similar to those present in persons with depression. If so, these findings could partially explain the link between alcohol use and depression. We applied a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the non-depressed general population (GP) (n = 247) and a cohort of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 99). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of hippuric acid in the GP cohort. In the GP cohort, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the MDD cohort, but in these individuals it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of hippuric acid suggest that already moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and depression.</p>
