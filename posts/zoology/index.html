The high functional conservation of gonads across organisms suggests the existence of as-yet-undefined common and essential factors in the regulation of such gonadal transformation. To identify these factors, we conducted a meta-analysis of public and newly derived gonadal transcriptome data from seven species. Classical sex change-related genes were differentially expressed between the ovary and transitional gonads, which corroborated previous reports on protogynous fishes. Moreover, we identified novel factors not previously associated with gonadal sex change in fish. Notably, the expression patterns of acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (aacs) and apolipoprotein Eb (apoeb), which are involved in cholesterol synthesis and catabolic processes, respectively, suggest that the levels of cholesterol, a precursor of steroid hormones crucial for sex change, are decreased upon sex change onset. Thus, cholesterol dynamics may influence gonadal transformation in protogynous fishes.\nAnalysis of a European general wildlife health surveillance program: chances, challenges and recommendations\nAuthors: Heiderich, E.; Keller, S.

However, GWHS programs operate in the face of legal, geographical, financial, or administrative conditions. The present study uses a multi-tiered approach to understand the current characteristics, strengths and gaps of a European GWHS that operates in a fragmented legislative and multi-stakeholder environment. The aim is to support the implementation or improvement of other GWHS systems by managers, surveillance experts, and administrations. To assess the current state of wildlife health investigations and trends within the GWHS, we analyzed 20 years of wildlife diagnostic data, conducted an online survey and phone interviews with official field partners (hunting administrators, game wardens and hunters), and performed a time-per-task analysis. Firstly, we found that infectious disease dynamics, the level of public awareness for specific diseases, research activities and increasing population sizes of in depth-monitored protected species, together with biogeographical and political boundaries all impacted case numbers and can present unexpected challenges to a GWHS. Secondly, we found that even a seemingly comprehensive GWHS can feature pronounced information gaps, with underrepresentation of common or easily recognizable diseases, blind spots in non-hunted species and only a fraction of discovered carcasses being submitted. Thirdly, we found that substantial amounts of wildlife health data may be available at local hunting administrations or disease specialist centers, but outside the reach of the GWHS and its processes. In conclusion, we recommend that fragmented and federalist GWHS programs like the one addressed require a central, consistent and accessible collection of wildlife health data. Also, considering the growing role of citizen observers in environmental research, we recommend using online reporting systems to harness decentrally available information and fill wildlife health information gaps.\nSwimmers itch control: timely waterfowl brood relocation significantly reduces an avian schistosome population and human cases on recreational lakes\nAuthors: DeJong, R. J.; Blankespoor, C.; Blankespoor, H.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548414\nSwimmers itch (SI) is a dermatitis in humans caused by cercariae of avian and mammalian schistosomes which emerge from infected snails on a daily basis. Mitigation methods for SI have long been sought with little success. Copper sulfate application to the water to kill the snail hosts is the historically employed method, but is localized, temporary, and harmful to many aquatic species. Here, we test an alternative method to control Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, a species well-known to cause SI in northern Michigan and elsewhere in North America. Summer relocation of broods of the only known vertebrate host, common merganser (Mergus merganser), greatly reduced snail infection prevalence the following year on two large, geographically separated lakes in northern Michigan. Subsequent years of host relocation achieved and maintained snail infection prevalence at [~]0.05%, more than an order of magnitude lower than pre-intervention. A Before - After - Control - Intervention (BACI) study design using multiple-year snail infection data from two intervention lakes and three control lakes demonstrates that substantial lake-wide reduction of an avian schistosome can be achieved and is not due to natural fluctuations in the parasite populations. The relevance of reducing snail infection prevalence is demonstrated by a large seven-year data set of SI incidence in swimmers at a high-use beach, which showed a remarkable reduction in SI cases in two successive years after relocation began. In addition, data from another Michigan lake where vertebrate-host based intervention occurred in the 1980s is analyzed statistically and shows a remarkably similar pattern of reduction in snail infection prevalence. Together, these results demonstrate a highly effective SI mitigation strategy that avoids the use of environmentally suspect chemicals and removes incentive for lethal host removal. Biologically, the results strongly suggest that T. stagnicolae is reliant on the yearly hatch of ducklings to maintain populations at high levels on a lake and that the role of migratory hosts in the spring and fall is much less significant.\nMale and female syringeal muscles exhibit superfast shortening velocities in Zebra finches\nAuthors: Gladman, N. W.; Elemans, C. P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545584\nVocalisations play a key role in the communication behaviour of many vertebrates. Vocal production requires extremely precise motor control, which is executed by superfast vocal muscles that can operate at cycle frequencies over 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz. The mechanical performance of these muscles has been quantified with isometric performance and the workloop technique, but due to methodological limitations we lack a key muscle property characterising muscle performance, the force-velocity (FV) relationship. Here we establish a method that allows quantification of the FV relationship in extremely fast muscles, and test if the maximal shortening velocity of zebra finch syringeal muscles is different between males and females. We show that syringeal muscles exhibit extremely high maximal shortening velocities of 46 L0 s-1, far exceeding most other vocal and skeletal muscles, and that isometric properties positively correlate with maximal shortening velocities. While male and female muscles differ in isometric speed measures, maximal shortening velocity surprisingly is not sex-dependent. We also show that cyclical methods to measure force-length properties used in classical laryngeal studies give the same result as conventional stepwise methodologies, suggesting either approach is appropriate. Next to force, instantaneous power also trades for speed, further highlighting these muscles are tuned to operate at high frequencies. We argue that the high thermal dependence of superfast vocal muscle performance may impact vocal behaviour. Summary statementZebra finch syringeal muscle exhibits superfast shortening of 46 L0 s-1. Shortening is not sex-specific but correlates with isometric performance - faster twitches and tetani are associated with faster shortening.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Swimmers itch (SI) is a dermatitis in humans caused by cercariae of avian and mammalian schistosomes which emerge from infected snails on a daily basis. Mitigation methods for SI have long been sought with little success. Copper sulfate application to the water to kill the snail hosts is the historically employed method, but is localized, temporary, and harmful to many aquatic species. Here, we test an alternative method to control Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, a species well-known to cause SI in northern Michigan and elsewhere in North America. Summer relocation of broods of the only known vertebrate host, common merganser (Mergus merganser), greatly reduced snail infection prevalence the following year on two large, geographically separated lakes in northern Michigan. Subsequent years of host relocation achieved and maintained snail infection prevalence at [~]0.05%, more than an order of magnitude lower than pre-intervention. A Before - After - Control - Intervention (BACI) study design using multiple-year snail infection data from two intervention lakes and three control lakes demonstrates that substantial lake-wide reduction of an avian schistosome can be achieved and is not due to natural fluctuations in the parasite populations. The relevance of reducing snail infection prevalence is demonstrated by a large seven-year data set of SI incidence in swimmers at a high-use beach, which showed a remarkable reduction in SI cases in two successive years after relocation began. In addition, data from another Michigan lake where vertebrate-host based intervention occurred in the 1980s is analyzed statistically and shows a remarkably similar pattern of reduction in snail infection prevalence. Together, these results demonstrate a highly effective SI mitigation strategy that avoids the use of environmentally suspect chemicals and removes incentive for lethal host removal. Biologically, the results strongly suggest that T. stagnicolae is reliant on the yearly hatch of ducklings to maintain populations at high levels on a lake and that the role of migratory hosts in the spring and fall is much less significant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalisations play a key role in the communication behaviour of many vertebrates. Vocal production requires extremely precise motor control, which is executed by superfast vocal muscles that can operate at cycle frequencies over 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz. The mechanical performance of these muscles has been quantified with isometric performance and the workloop technique, but due to methodological limitations we lack a key muscle property characterising muscle performance, the force-velocity (FV) relationship. Here we establish a method that allows quantification of the FV relationship in extremely fast muscles, and test if the maximal shortening velocity of zebra finch syringeal muscles is different between males and females. We show that syringeal muscles exhibit extremely high maximal shortening velocities of 46 L0 s-1, far exceeding most other vocal and skeletal muscles, and that isometric properties positively correlate with maximal shortening velocities. While male and female muscles differ in isometric speed measures, maximal shortening velocity surprisingly is not sex-dependent. We also show that cyclical methods to measure force-length properties used in classical laryngeal studies give the same result as conventional stepwise methodologies, suggesting either approach is appropriate. Next to force, instantaneous power also trades for speed, further highlighting these muscles are tuned to operate at high frequencies. We argue that the high thermal dependence of superfast vocal muscle performance may impact vocal behaviour.

Summary statementZebra finch syringeal muscle exhibits superfast shortening of 46 L0 s-1. Shortening is not sex-specific but correlates with isometric performance - faster twitches and tetani are associated with faster shortening.</p>
