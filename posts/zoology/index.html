To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.\nEffect of environmental conditions on the wing morphometric variation in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in India\nAuthors: Sharma, G.; Sarma, D. K.; Bhutiani, R.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578359\nAedes aegypti an efficient vector of different arboviral diseases, is a major concern for public health globally. Originating from Africa, this vector has now invaded most of the parts of the world, which shows its thriving adaptability against diverse ecological conditions. In India too, Ae. aegypti has been found almost everywhere and along with Ae. albopictus, it contributed more than 0.2 million cases of dengue in the year 2022. Due to heterogeneous environmental settings in India, this vector has shown various intraspecific variations including its behavioral, genetic, and physiological characteristics. Thus, the present study hypothesized that there will be some differences in wing morphometrics across the country for this species. Considering this, we have sampled adults and immatures of Ae. aegypti from 11 distinct locations, representing six varied climatic regions of India. The immatures were reared to adult and the right wing was used to score the morphometric variations. A significant variation in wing size and shape was observed. The Himalayan region (Srinagar CS: 1.92 MM) supports the shortest (CS: 2.04 mm) wing size mosquitoes while the Deccan Peninsular region (Nagpur CS: 4.48 mm) exhibits the largest (CS: 4.46 mm) wing size mosquito. After excluding the allometric effect, the semi-desert region (Kota) showed the greatest wide variety of wing shapes corresponding to a larger morphospace in CVA analysis. In addition, region-wise wing size was found positively correlated with temperature (64%) and altitude (82%) but no directional trend was detected for wing shape characteristics. Conclusively, the study suggests the existence of varied population structures of Ae. aegypti in India based on wing morphometric analysis. This finding will be helpful towards focused actions and early measures to reduce the impact of these diseases carrying mosquitoes on public health.\nFecundity Estimation of Atlantic mudskipper Periophthalmus barbarus in Ogbo-Okolo mangrove Forest of Santa Barbara River, Bayelsa State Niger Delta, Nigeria\nAuthors: Nathaniel, A. M.; Soberekon, I. J.; Gamage, I. E.; Eli, A. A.; Raimi, M. O.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578404\nRationale: Fecundity estimation and reproductive biology of Atlantic mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarus) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria needs to be studied. Objectives: To estimate fecundity, gonadosomatic index, and condition factor of P. barbarus and describe its reproductive biology. Methods: P. barbarus specimens were collected from Ogbo-Okolo mangrove forest in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Length, weight, and gonad weight measurements were taken. Fecundity was estimated by the gravimetric method. Length-weight relationship, condition factor, and gonadosomatic index were calculated. Ovarian developmental stages were identified. Results: Highest mean fecundity of 9612.7 eggs was observed in females of 10.1-12.0 cm standard length and 20.0-27.9 g weight. Length-weight relationship showed specimens were in good condition. Gonadosomatic index was higher in smaller individuals. Four ovarian developmental stages were identified. Conclusion: P. barbarus exhibits high fecundity. Reproductive potential is greater in intermediate sized individuals compared to smaller or larger fish. Recommendations: Sustainable management practices should be implemented to conserve P. barbarus stocks in the Niger Delta region. Further research into reproductive behavior and ecology is needed.\nHow smart was T. rex? Testing claims of exceptional cognition in dinosaurs and the application of neuron count estimates in palaeontological research\nAuthors: Caspar, K. R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 66.7, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\nNationwide surveillance identifies yellow fever and chikungunya viruses transmitted by various species of Aedes mosquitoes in Nigeria\nAuthors: Nwangwu, U.; Oguzie, J.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has coordinated responses to the outbreaks with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). The National Arbovirus and Vectors Research Centre (NAVRC) handles the vector component of these responses. This study sought to identify the vectors driving YF transmission and any of the targeted arboviruses and their distribution across states. MethodsEggs, larvae and pupae as well as adult mosquitoes were collected in observational, analytical, and cross-sectional surveys conducted in sixteen YF outbreak states between 2017 and 2020. Adult mosquitoes (field-collected or reared from immature stages) were morphologically identified, and arboviruses were detected using RT-qPCR at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID). ResultsAedes mosquitoes were collected in eleven of the sixteen states surveyed and the mosquitoes in nine states were found infected with arboviruses. A total of seven Aedes species were collected from different parts of the country. Aedes aegypti was the most dominant (51%) species, whereas Aedes africanus was the least (0.2%). Yellow fever virus (YFV) was discovered in 33 ([~]26%) out of the 127 Aedes mosquito pools. In addition to YFV, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was found in nine pools. Except for Ae. africanus, all the Aedes species tested positive for at least one arbovirus. YFV-positive pools were found in six (6) Aedes species while CHIKV-positive pools were only recorded in two Aedes species. Edo State had the most positive pools (16), while Nasarawa, Imo, and Anambra states had the least (1 positive pool). Breteau and house indices were higher than normal transmission thresholds in all but one state. ConclusionIn Nigeria, there is a substantial risk of arbovirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, with YFV posing the largest threat at the moment. This risk is heightened by the fact that YFV and CHIKV have been detected in vectors across outbreak locations. Hence, there is an urgent need to step up arbovirus surveillance and control activities in the country. Author summaryEpidemics of arboviral infections are fast becoming the norm across Africa, especially in Nigeria, where sporadic epidemics of Aedes-borne Yellow Fever (YF) have been on the rise since 2017. A nationwide surveillance was conducted to detect the arboviruses and the vectors transmitting them during large YF outbreaks across Nigeria. Aedes mosquitoes collected from 57 local government areas/outbreak locations, covering 16 out of the 36 states in Nigeria, were reared to adulthood, morphologically identified to species level and assayed using qRT-PCR to detect six epidemiologically important arboviruses (Dengue, Chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika, YF, West Nile and Onyong nyong). Seven Aedes species (including Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. circumluteolus, Ae. vittatus, Ae. simpsoni complex, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. africanus), were caught, with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus the most widespread and predominant. Only YF and CHKV were found in mosquito pools from 9 states, with only Ae. aegypti pools positive for CHKV, while YF virus was found predominantly in this species and Ae. albopictus. This study provides a baseline for widespread distribution of the major Aedes vectors, and their arboviral transmission profiles, which can enhance evidence-based control measures, and strengthen nationwide surveillance systems to forestall future outbreaks of public health magnitude.\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) - an updated record of butterfly for Saudi Arabia\nAuthors: ALFAKIH, A.; AL FAIFY, E. A.\nScore: 39.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572884\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A free-swimming larval stage features in many marine invertebrate life cycles. To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aedes aegypti an efficient vector of different arboviral diseases, is a major concern for public health globally. Originating from Africa, this vector has now invaded most of the parts of the world, which shows its thriving adaptability against diverse ecological conditions. In India too, Ae. aegypti has been found almost everywhere and along with Ae. albopictus, it contributed more than 0.2 million cases of dengue in the year 2022. Due to heterogeneous environmental settings in India, this vector has shown various intraspecific variations including its behavioral, genetic, and physiological characteristics. Thus, the present study hypothesized that there will be some differences in wing morphometrics across the country for this species. Considering this, we have sampled adults and immatures of Ae. aegypti from 11 distinct locations, representing six varied climatic regions of India. The immatures were reared to adult and the right wing was used to score the morphometric variations. A significant variation in wing size and shape was observed. The Himalayan region (Srinagar CS: 1.92 MM) supports the shortest (CS: 2.04 mm) wing size mosquitoes while the Deccan Peninsular region (Nagpur CS: 4.48 mm) exhibits the largest (CS: 4.46 mm) wing size mosquito. After excluding the allometric effect, the semi-desert region (Kota) showed the greatest wide variety of wing shapes corresponding to a larger morphospace in CVA analysis. In addition, region-wise wing size was found positively correlated with temperature (64%) and altitude (82%) but no directional trend was detected for wing shape characteristics. Conclusively, the study suggests the existence of varied population structures of Ae. aegypti in India based on wing morphometric analysis. This finding will be helpful towards focused actions and early measures to reduce the impact of these diseases carrying mosquitoes on public health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Rationale: Fecundity estimation and reproductive biology of Atlantic mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarus) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria needs to be studied. Objectives: To estimate fecundity, gonadosomatic index, and condition factor of P. barbarus and describe its reproductive biology. Methods: P. barbarus specimens were collected from Ogbo-Okolo mangrove forest in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Length, weight, and gonad weight measurements were taken. Fecundity was estimated by the gravimetric method. Length-weight relationship, condition factor, and gonadosomatic index were calculated. Ovarian developmental stages were identified. Results: Highest mean fecundity of 9612.7 eggs was observed in females of 10.1-12.0 cm standard length and 20.0-27.9 g weight. Length-weight relationship showed specimens were in good condition. Gonadosomatic index was higher in smaller individuals. Four ovarian developmental stages were identified. Conclusion: P. barbarus exhibits high fecundity. Reproductive potential is greater in intermediate sized individuals compared to smaller or larger fish. Recommendations: Sustainable management practices should be implemented to conserve P. barbarus stocks in the Niger Delta region. Further research into reproductive behavior and ecology is needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with &#34;macaque- or baboon-like cognition&#34; whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSince its reemergence in 2017, yellow fever (YF) has been active in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has coordinated responses to the outbreaks with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). The National Arbovirus and Vectors Research Centre (NAVRC) handles the vector component of these responses. This study sought to identify the vectors driving YF transmission and any of the targeted arboviruses and their distribution across states.

MethodsEggs, larvae and pupae as well as adult mosquitoes were collected in observational, analytical, and cross-sectional surveys conducted in sixteen YF outbreak states between 2017 and 2020. Adult mosquitoes (field-collected or reared from immature stages) were morphologically identified, and arboviruses were detected using RT-qPCR at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID).

ResultsAedes mosquitoes were collected in eleven of the sixteen states surveyed and the mosquitoes in nine states were found infected with arboviruses. A total of seven Aedes species were collected from different parts of the country. Aedes aegypti was the most dominant (51%) species, whereas Aedes africanus was the least (0.2%). Yellow fever virus (YFV) was discovered in 33 ([~]26%) out of the 127 Aedes mosquito pools. In addition to YFV, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was found in nine pools. Except for Ae. africanus, all the Aedes species tested positive for at least one arbovirus. YFV-positive pools were found in six (6) Aedes species while CHIKV-positive pools were only recorded in two Aedes species. Edo State had the most positive pools (16), while Nasarawa, Imo, and Anambra states had the least (1 positive pool). Breteau and house indices were higher than normal transmission thresholds in all but one state.

ConclusionIn Nigeria, there is a substantial risk of arbovirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, with YFV posing the largest threat at the moment. This risk is heightened by the fact that YFV and CHIKV have been detected in vectors across outbreak locations. Hence, there is an urgent need to step up arbovirus surveillance and control activities in the country.

Author summaryEpidemics of arboviral infections are fast becoming the norm across Africa, especially in Nigeria, where sporadic epidemics of Aedes-borne Yellow Fever (YF) have been on the rise since 2017. A nationwide surveillance was conducted to detect the arboviruses and the vectors transmitting them during large YF outbreaks across Nigeria. Aedes mosquitoes collected from 57 local government areas/outbreak locations, covering 16 out of the 36 states in Nigeria, were reared to adulthood, morphologically identified to species level and assayed using qRT-PCR to detect six epidemiologically important arboviruses (Dengue, Chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika, YF, West Nile and Onyong nyong). Seven Aedes species (including Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. circumluteolus, Ae. vittatus, Ae. simpsoni complex, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. africanus), were caught, with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus the most widespread and predominant. Only YF and CHKV were found in mosquito pools from 9 states, with only Ae. aegypti pools positive for CHKV, while YF virus was found predominantly in this species and Ae. albopictus. This study provides a baseline for widespread distribution of the major Aedes vectors, and their arboviral transmission profiles, which can enhance evidence-based control measures, and strengthen nationwide surveillance systems to forestall future outbreaks of public health magnitude.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.</p>
