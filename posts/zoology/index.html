Polydorid infestations pose a significant challenge to shellfish aquaculture by impacting marketability and profitability of farms. In this study, we investigated the prevalence, intensity, identity and biogeography of shell-boring worms infecting both farmed and wild oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from three sites in Wellfleet Harbor, Massachusetts - an economically important shellfishing region in the northeastern United States.">

A.; Strong, M.; Brennessel, B.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553105\nPolydorid infestations pose a significant challenge to shellfish aquaculture by impacting marketability and profitability of farms. In this study, we investigated the prevalence, intensity, identity and biogeography of shell-boring worms infecting both farmed and wild oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from three sites in Wellfleet Harbor, Massachusetts - an economically important shellfishing region in the northeastern United States. DNA barcoding revealed that Polydora websteri was the sole culprit responsible for infecting oysters from all three sites, reaching maximum prevalence (100% infection) and intensity (mean intensity: 38.63) in the Herring River. The oysters in the Herring River are subjected to restricted tidal flow due to the presence of a physical barrier (dike), and this could be responsible for the high infestation levels of P. websteri observed in this population. In addition, a population genetic analysis incorporating COI sequence data from Wellfleet P. websteri in addition to newly published sequences from the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov found very low levels of genetic differentiation across several intercontinental populations (0.000 - 0.399), which is likely being driven by multiple introductory events such as oyster importations. These findings are discussed in relation to the future of shellfish aquaculture in the United States.\nAedes aegypti CCEae3A carboxylase expression confers carbamate, organophosphate and limited pyrethroid resistance in a model transgenic mosquito\nAuthors: Poulton, B. C.; Colman, F.; Anthousi, A.; Sattelle, D. B.; Lycett, G. J.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553486\nInsecticide resistance is a serious threat to our ability to control mosquito vectors which transmit pathogens including malaria parasites and arboviruses. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is an essential first step in tackling the challenges presented by resistance. This study aimed to functionally characterise the carboxylesterase, CCEae3A, the elevated expression of which has been implicated in temephos resistance in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae. Using our GAL4/UAS expression system, already established in insecticide-sensitive Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, we produced transgenic An. gambiae mosquitoes that express an Ae. aegypti CCEae3A ubiquitously. This new transgenic line permits examination of CCEae3A expression in a background which does not express the gene and allows comparison with existing An. gambiae GAL4-UAS lines. Insecticide resistance profiling of these transgenic An. gambiae larvae indicated significant increases in resistance ratio for three organophosphate insecticides, temephos (5.98), chloropyriphos (6.64) and fenthion (3.18) when compared to the parental strain. Cross resistance to adulticides from three major insecticide classes: organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos methyl), carbamates (bendiocarb and propoxur) and pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) was also detected. Resistance to certain organophosphates and carbamates validates conclusions drawn from previous expression and phenotypic data. However, detection of resistance to pirimiphos methyl and alphacypermethrin has not previously been formally associated with CCEae3A, despite occurring in Ae. aegypti strains where this gene was upregulated. Our findings highlight the importance of characterising individual resistance mechanisms, thereby ensuring accurate information is used to guide future vector control strategies.\nHoney bee Apis mellifera L. Responses to Oxidative Stress Induced by Pharmacological and Pesticide Compounds\nAuthors: Tahir, F.; Goblirsch, M.; Adamczyk, J.; Karim, S.; Alburaki, M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553037\nThe western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a eusocial insect that plays major roles in ecosystem balances and pollination of plants and food crops. Honey bees face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pathogens, diseases, chemical pesticides, and climate change, which all contribute to honey bee colony loss. This study investigated the impacts of multiple pharmacological and pesticide molecules on honey bee survival and gene regulation responses. In an 11-day cage experiment, sublethal doses of tunicamycin, thapsigargin, metformin, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, and imidacloprid were administered to newly emerged sister bees. Daily treatment consumption and mortality were recorded, as well as the transcription expression of twelve major genes (AChE-2, Apisimin, Apidaecin, mrjp1, Sodq, cp450, SelT, SelK, Ire1, Xbp1, Derl-1, Hsc70), some of which are markers of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in honey bees. At day 9 of the treatments, protein damage was quantified in caged bees. Kaplan-Meier model indicated significant (p \u003c 0.001) toxicological effects of paraquat, H2O2 and tunicamycin on bee survivorship compared to controls with better survivals for other molecules. Post-ingestive aversion responses were recorded only in the case of tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and imidacloprid. Nonetheless, significantly higher protein damage on day 9 was only identified in bees exposed to paraquat and imidacloprid. Some antioxidant genes significantly regulated vis-a-vis specific treatments. Our results reveal age-related regulation of other major genes with significant inter-gene positive correlations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a eusocial insect that plays major roles in ecosystem balances and pollination of plants and food crops. Honey bees face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pathogens, diseases, chemical pesticides, and climate change, which all contribute to honey bee colony loss. This study investigated the impacts of multiple pharmacological and pesticide molecules on honey bee survival and gene regulation responses. In an 11-day cage experiment, sublethal doses of tunicamycin, thapsigargin, metformin, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, and imidacloprid were administered to newly emerged sister bees. Daily treatment consumption and mortality were recorded, as well as the transcription expression of twelve major genes (AChE-2, Apisimin, Apidaecin, mrjp1, Sodq, cp450, SelT, SelK, Ire1, Xbp1, Derl-1, Hsc70), some of which are markers of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in honey bees. At day 9 of the treatments, protein damage was quantified in caged bees. Kaplan-Meier model indicated significant (p &lt; 0.001) toxicological effects of paraquat, H2O2 and tunicamycin on bee survivorship compared to controls with better survivals for other molecules. Post-ingestive aversion responses were recorded only in the case of tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and imidacloprid. Nonetheless, significantly higher protein damage on day 9 was only identified in bees exposed to paraquat and imidacloprid. Some antioxidant genes significantly regulated vis-a-vis specific treatments. Our results reveal age-related regulation of other major genes with significant inter-gene positive correlations.</p>
