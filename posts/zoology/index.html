I.; Rail, J.-F.; Cormier, T.; Beaumont, M.; Bowser, C.; Burt, T. V.; Collins, S.; Duffy, S.; Giacinti, J. A.; Gilliland, S.; Giroux, J.-F.; Gjerdrum, C.; Guillemette, M.; Hargan, K.

J.; Seyer, Y.; Soos, C.; Ward, C. R. E.; Wells, R.; Wight, J.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574233\nIn 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.\nNutritional characterisation and seasonal variation of goat forages in Central Malawi\nAuthors: Cooke, A. S.; Mvula, W.; Ventura-Cordero, J.; Gwiriri, L. C.; Takahashi, T.; Morgan, E. R.; Lee, M. R. F.; Safalaoh, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573017\nGoat ownership is prevalent across rural Malawi and provides a vital source of income, nutrition, and food security. However, goat performance is poor, and this presents a risk to individuals and communities who depend on them. Nutrition is fundamental to health and productivity of any livestock enterprise, it is required to be able to deal with stresses, such as disease, and to enable growth and production. The aim of this study was to characterise the nutritional profile of naturally available forages in Malawi, including the seasonal variation in nutrition. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over a 17-month period, across four villages (30 farms/smallholders) in Central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre fractions, and ash/organic matter and NDVI was used as a measure of forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability appeared most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. Whilst there were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, the drivers of this were unclear, but could be due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season represent a seasonal nutrition-gap which may result in risks to goat health and productivity. Whilst mitigating this through supplementation of persevered forages may be possible, this is a challenge due to limitations of resources and the fact that goats free-roam during the dry season.\nA polytypic species revisited: Phylogenetic and morphological variation, taxonomic status, and geographical distribution of Trachops (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae)\nAuthors: Camacho, M. A.; Menendez-Guerrero, P. A.; Horvath, B.; Cadar, D.; Murienne, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574068\nThe taxonomic status of the neotropical bat genus Trachops has been reevaluated through an integrated study that incorporates morphological, morphometric, and molecular data across its extensive geographic range. Our research, which included previously unexamined regions, revealed substantial insights into the diversity within Trachops. The results support the elevation of T. cirrhosus ehrhardti to species status, due to genetic and morphological differences in southeastern Brazil specimens. Conversely, our comprehensive analysis found insufficient evidence to maintain the subspecific distinction of T. c. coffini, which lacks diagnosable morphological characters and is not genetically distinct from T. c. cirrhosus across its distribution range. Additionally, our findings challenge the previous belief of a latitudinal differentiation in body size for Trachops cirrhosus, as specimens from western South America and northeastern South America exhibit similar sizes to those from Central America. These results underscore the importance of revising the taxonomic framework for this bat genus, contributing to a more precise understanding of its evolutionary relationships, and further enhancing conservation efforts, considering the potential threats to the newly recognized T. ehrhardti in the imperiled Atlantic Forest of Brazil.\nImage-Based Recognition of Parasitoid Wasps Using Advanced Neural Networks\nAuthors: Shirali, H.; Hübner, J.; Both, R.; Raupach, M.; Schmidt, S.; Pylatiuk, C.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573817\nHymenoptera have some of the highest diversity and number of individuals among insects. Many of these species potentially play key roles as food sources, pest controllers, and pollinators. However, little is known about their diversity and biology, and about 80% of the species have not been described yet. Classical taxonomy based on morphology is a rather slow process, but DNA barcoding has already brought considerable progress in identification. Innovative methods such as image-based identification and automation can even further speed up the process. We present a proof of concept for image data recognition of a parasitic wasp family, the Diapriidae (Hymenoptera), obtained as part of the GBOL III project. These tiny (1.2 - 4.5 mm) wasps were photographed and identified using DNA barcoding to provide a solid ground truth for training a neural network. Subsequently, three different neural network architectures were trained, evaluated, and optimized. As a result, 11 different classes of diaprids and one class of \"other Hymenoptera can be classified with an average accuracy of 96%. Additionally, the sex of the specimen can be classified automatically with an accuracy of \u003e 96%.\nEndangered Przewalski's horse, Equus pzrewalskii, cloned from historically cryopreserved cells\nAuthors: Novak, B.

These stallions are clones of a male that lived from 1975-1998 that pedigree analyses identified as a genetically valuable male for present-day conservation breeding. This is the first time that multiple healthy clones have been produced for an endangered species.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Goat ownership is prevalent across rural Malawi and provides a vital source of income, nutrition, and food security. However, goat performance is poor, and this presents a risk to individuals and communities who depend on them. Nutrition is fundamental to health and productivity of any livestock enterprise, it is required to be able to deal with stresses, such as disease, and to enable growth and production. The aim of this study was to characterise the nutritional profile of naturally available forages in Malawi, including the seasonal variation in nutrition. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over a 17-month period, across four villages (30 farms/smallholders) in Central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre fractions, and ash/organic matter and NDVI was used as a measure of forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability appeared most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. Whilst there were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, the drivers of this were unclear, but could be due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season represent a seasonal nutrition-gap which may result in risks to goat health and productivity. Whilst mitigating this through supplementation of persevered forages may be possible, this is a challenge due to limitations of resources and the fact that goats free-roam during the dry season.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The taxonomic status of the neotropical bat genus Trachops has been reevaluated through an integrated study that incorporates morphological, morphometric, and molecular data across its extensive geographic range. Our research, which included previously unexamined regions, revealed substantial insights into the diversity within Trachops. The results support the elevation of T. cirrhosus ehrhardti to species status, due to genetic and morphological differences in southeastern Brazil specimens. Conversely, our comprehensive analysis found insufficient evidence to maintain the subspecific distinction of T. c. coffini, which lacks diagnosable morphological characters and is not genetically distinct from T. c. cirrhosus across its distribution range. Additionally, our findings challenge the previous belief of a latitudinal differentiation in body size for Trachops cirrhosus, as specimens from western South America and northeastern South America exhibit similar sizes to those from Central America. These results underscore the importance of revising the taxonomic framework for this bat genus, contributing to a more precise understanding of its evolutionary relationships, and further enhancing conservation efforts, considering the potential threats to the newly recognized T. ehrhardti in the imperiled Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hymenoptera have some of the highest diversity and number of individuals among insects. Many of these species potentially play key roles as food sources, pest controllers, and pollinators. However, little is known about their diversity and biology, and about 80% of the species have not been described yet. Classical taxonomy based on morphology is a rather slow process, but DNA barcoding has already brought considerable progress in identification. Innovative methods such as image-based identification and automation can even further speed up the process. We present a proof of concept for image data recognition of a parasitic wasp family, the Diapriidae (Hymenoptera), obtained as part of the GBOL III project. These tiny (1.2 - 4.5 mm) wasps were photographed and identified using DNA barcoding to provide a solid ground truth for training a neural network. Subsequently, three different neural network architectures were trained, evaluated, and optimized. As a result, 11 different classes of diaprids and one class of &#34;other Hymenoptera  can be classified with an average accuracy of 96%. Additionally, the sex of the specimen can be classified automatically with an accuracy of &gt; 96%.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Two endangered Przewalskis horse stallions were cloned from fibroblast cells cultured and cryopreserved in 1980. These stallions are clones of a male that lived from 1975-1998 that pedigree analyses identified as a genetically valuable male for present-day conservation breeding. This is the first time that multiple healthy clones have been produced for an endangered species.</p>
