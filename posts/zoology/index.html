E.; Wells, R.; Wight, J.\nScore: 18.4, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574233\nIn 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.\nInvestments in photoreceptors compete with investments in optics to determine eye design\nAuthors: Heras, F. J. H.; Laughlin, S. B.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576511\nBecause an animal invests in an eyes optics and photoreceptor array to meet behavioural needs at minimum cost, optics and photoreceptors compete for resources to maximise eye performance. This competition has not previously been investigated. Its outcome depends on the relative costs and benefits of investing space, materials and energy in optics and photoreceptors. We introduce a measure of cost, specific volume in {micro}m3 sr-1, which relates to performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. We model apposition compound eyes and simple (camera type) eyes to calculate the performance surface across the morphospace of eyes of given type and total cost. This surface identifies the allocation of resources that maximises efficiency and shows how efficiency reduces as eye morphology departs from optimum. Using published data, we calculate specific volumes to estimate the investments in optics and photoreceptors that insects make, and compare these with our models. We find that efficient allocation can explain three robust trends: fast flying diurnal insects allocate \u003e 50% of eye volume to photoreceptor arrays, their photoreceptors photosensitive waveguides (rhabdomeres, rhabdoms) are much longer than simple eyes, and length increases systematically with spatial resolution. We conclude that photoreceptor costs often equal or exceed optical costs, therefore competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources is a major factor in eye design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to maximise efficiency is a design principle. Our methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost:benefit lens.\nHow smart was T. rex? Testing claims of exceptional cognition in dinosaurs and the application of neuron count estimates in palaeontological research\nAuthors: Caspar, K. R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 67.4, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\nLaboratory evaluation of the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual (a deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net) against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae\nAuthors: Syme, T. W.; N'dombidje, B.; Todjinou, D.; Ariori, V.; Ngufor, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577674\nPyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets have been recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after an alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr net showed improved impact in epidemiological trials. PermaNet(R) Dual is a new deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net developed by Vestergaard Sarl to expand options to control programmes. We performed a series of laboratory studies according to WHO guidelines to assess the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual. Regeneration time was determined by subjecting net pieces to cone bioassays and tunnel tests before and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after washing. The wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual was evaluated compared to WHO-prequalified pyrethroid-only (PermaNet(R) 2.0) and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (Interceptor(R) G2) nets by testing net pieces washed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 times in cone bioassays and tunnel tests. Tests were performed with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae to separately assess the pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr components. Net pieces were also analysed to determine insecticide content. In regeneration time studies, the biological activity of the deltamethrin and chlorfenapyr components of PermaNet(R) Dual regenerated within 1 day after washing and a 1-day washing interval was adopted for wash-resistance studies. PermaNet(R) Dual induced high mortality (98%) and blood-feeding inhibition (98%) of the susceptible strain after 20 washes fulfilling WHO efficacy criteria in tunnel tests ([\u0026ge;]80% mortality, [\u0026ge;]90% blood-feeding inhibition). Similar results were obtained with PermaNet(R) 2.0 (99% mortality, 99% blood-feeding inhibition) and Interceptor(R) G2 (99% mortality, 98% blood-feeding inhibition) washed 20 times. In wash-resistance tunnel tests against the pyrethroid-resistant strain, PermaNet(R) Dual washed 20 times induced high mortality (91%) and blood-feeding inhibition (73%) which was similar to Interceptor(R) G2 (87% mortality, 79% blood-feeding inhibition) and superior to PermaNet(R) 2.0 (47% mortality, 68% blood-feeding inhibition). PermaNet(R) Dual fulfilled WHO efficacy criteria in laboratory bioassays and showed potential to improve control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Because an animal invests in an eyes optics and photoreceptor array to meet behavioural needs at minimum cost, optics and photoreceptors compete for resources to maximise eye performance. This competition has not previously been investigated. Its outcome depends on the relative costs and benefits of investing space, materials and energy in optics and photoreceptors. We introduce a measure of cost, specific volume in {micro}m3 sr-1, which relates to performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. We model apposition compound eyes and simple (camera type) eyes to calculate the performance surface across the morphospace of eyes of given type and total cost. This surface identifies the allocation of resources that maximises efficiency and shows how efficiency reduces as eye morphology departs from optimum. Using published data, we calculate specific volumes to estimate the investments in optics and photoreceptors that insects make, and compare these with our models. We find that efficient allocation can explain three robust trends: fast flying diurnal insects allocate &gt; 50% of eye volume to photoreceptor arrays, their photoreceptors photosensitive waveguides (rhabdomeres, rhabdoms) are much longer than simple eyes, and length increases systematically with spatial resolution. We conclude that photoreceptor costs often equal or exceed optical costs, therefore competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources is a major factor in eye design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to maximise efficiency is a design principle. Our methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost:benefit lens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with &#34;macaque- or baboon-like cognition&#34; whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets have been recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after an alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr net showed improved impact in epidemiological trials. PermaNet(R) Dual is a new deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net developed by Vestergaard Sarl to expand options to control programmes. We performed a series of laboratory studies according to WHO guidelines to assess the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual. Regeneration time was determined by subjecting net pieces to cone bioassays and tunnel tests before and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after washing. The wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual was evaluated compared to WHO-prequalified pyrethroid-only (PermaNet(R) 2.0) and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (Interceptor(R) G2) nets by testing net pieces washed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 times in cone bioassays and tunnel tests. Tests were performed with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae to separately assess the pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr components. Net pieces were also analysed to determine insecticide content. In regeneration time studies, the biological activity of the deltamethrin and chlorfenapyr components of PermaNet(R) Dual regenerated within 1 day after washing and a 1-day washing interval was adopted for wash-resistance studies. PermaNet(R) Dual induced high mortality (98%) and blood-feeding inhibition (98%) of the susceptible strain after 20 washes fulfilling WHO efficacy criteria in tunnel tests ([&amp;ge;]80% mortality, [&amp;ge;]90% blood-feeding inhibition). Similar results were obtained with PermaNet(R) 2.0 (99% mortality, 99% blood-feeding inhibition) and Interceptor(R) G2 (99% mortality, 98% blood-feeding inhibition) washed 20 times. In wash-resistance tunnel tests against the pyrethroid-resistant strain, PermaNet(R) Dual washed 20 times induced high mortality (91%) and blood-feeding inhibition (73%) which was similar to Interceptor(R) G2 (87% mortality, 79% blood-feeding inhibition) and superior to PermaNet(R) 2.0 (47% mortality, 68% blood-feeding inhibition). PermaNet(R) Dual fulfilled WHO efficacy criteria in laboratory bioassays and showed potential to improve control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors.</p>
