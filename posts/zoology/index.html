  "articleBody": " \"Dark taxonomy\": a new protocol for overcoming the taxonomic impediments for dark taxa and broadening the taxon base for biodiversity assessment\nAuthors: Meier, R.; Srivathsan, A.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Amorim, D. d. S.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555664\nWe are entering the 6th mass extinction event on the planet with scarcely any data for \"dark taxa\" that comprise most animal species. These taxa have been neglected, because conventional taxonomic methods are not well-equipped to process tens of thousands of specimens belonging to thousands of species. We here test a new protocol for tackling the data deficiency problem for dark taxa by simultaneously addressing (1) taxonomic impediments, (2) lack of biodiversity baseline data, (3) and low impact of revisionary research. We propose to overcome the taxonomic impediments by carrying out revisions at small geographic scales to keep the number of specimens and species manageable. To lower the risk of taxonomic error, species delimitation and description are based on multiple data sources (\"integrative taxonomy\"). Secondly, we propose to create baseline data for dark taxa by initially revising them only based on fresh specimens obtained with the same sampling methods that are also used for biodiversity monitoring (e.g., Malaise traps for flying insects). This ensures that the revision constitutes a biodiversity baseline and the species most relevant for biomonitoring are revised first. Thirdly, we propose to improve the impact of taxonomic revisions by publishing two papers addressing different readerships (general and specialists). We illustrate our proposals by carrying out a taxonomic revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore based on specimens obtained with Malaise traps placed at 107 sites across different habitats. We show that a first batch of specimens (N=1,456) contains 120 species, of which 115 are new to science and described in a separate taxonomic monograph. Species delimitation started with obtaining NGS barcodes (313-bp) that were used for estimating the number of MOTUs. This revealed 116-129 MOTUs depending on whether PTP, ABGD (P=0.001- 0.060), or objective clustering (2-5%) was used. Afterwards, we applied the \"LIT\" process (Large- scale Integrative Taxonomy) which optimizes the integration of morphological and molecular data by using the molecular data to identify which specimens should be studied morphologically. Applying LIT to 3% MOTUs revealed a match ratio of 91% between the MOTUs and putative morphospecies, but an even higher match ratio of 97% was found for MOTUs obtained with 5% Objective Clustering and ABGD (P=0.060). Using these parameters, only two MOTUs had to be fused for perfect congruence between molecular and morphological data for the 120 species. To test the completeness of our monograph, we then analyzed a second batch of 1,567 specimens. Here, all clustering algorithms and settings revealed only 20 additional MOTUs. This means that the first batch of specimens already covered 85% of the diversity, although 22% and 10% of the species are singletons or doubletons, respectively. Even more remarkable is that \u003e97% of all specimens in the second batch belonged to species described based on the first batch. The study thus demonstrates that revisions of dark taxa at moderate geographic scales with a moderate number of specimens from standardized traps can move dark taxa from being unavailable for biomonitoring to being well suited. Incidentally, the study also increases the number of described species of Mycetophilidae in the entire Oriental Region by \u003e25% indicating the size of taxonomic impediments for dark taxa in Southeast Asia.\nThe threats to reptiles at global and regional scales\nAuthors: Farooq, H.; Harfoot, M.; Rahbek, C.; Geldmann, J.\nScore: 23.2, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556803\nAt least 20% of reptiles are currently threatened with extinction. Due to the lack of comprehensive global assessments of the group, they have been omitted from spatial studies, especially the ones addressing conservation or spatial prioritization. With the recent release of global assessments for reptiles, in this study, we calculate the probability of seven biodiversity threats - logging, pollution, agriculture, invasive species, hunting, climate change and urbanization occurring at a global scale on a 50x50km grid and their impact measured as the probability of finding a threatened species. Despite the global nature of our approach, we compartmented the terrestrial land into 12 regions and conducted separate analyses on each region. We find that despite globally low levels of intensity, climate change and invasive species have the highest impact on reptiles. But when looked at the regional level, various threats have a high impact on biodiversity, even surpassing climate change and invasives. Our study highlights the importance of going beyond measuring the intensity of threats to measure impact and also the importance of subdividing the world into smaller units and testing the impacts separately.\nAn integrative taxonomic treatment of the Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) from Singapore reveals 115 new species on 730km2\nAuthors: Amorim, D. d. S.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Srivathsan, A.; Meier, R.\nScore: 46.7, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.555672\n\"Open ended\" or \"dark taxa\" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu \u0026 Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu \u0026 Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\nHeat Tolerance is Affected by the Gut Microbiota in a Vertebrate Ectotherm\nAuthors: Dallas, J. W.; Kazarina, A.; Lee, S. T. M.; Warne, R. W.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556683\nThe gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We are entering the 6th mass extinction event on the planet with scarcely any data for &#34;dark taxa&#34; that comprise most animal species. These taxa have been neglected, because conventional taxonomic methods are not well-equipped to process tens of thousands of specimens belonging to thousands of species. We here test a new protocol for tackling the data deficiency problem for dark taxa by simultaneously addressing (1) taxonomic impediments, (2) lack of biodiversity baseline data, (3) and low impact of revisionary research. We propose to overcome the taxonomic impediments by carrying out revisions at small geographic scales to keep the number of specimens and species manageable. To lower the risk of taxonomic error, species delimitation and description are based on multiple data sources (&#34;integrative taxonomy&#34;). Secondly, we propose to create baseline data for dark taxa by initially revising them only based on fresh specimens obtained with the same sampling methods that are also used for biodiversity monitoring (e.g., Malaise traps for flying insects). This ensures that the revision constitutes a biodiversity baseline and the species most relevant for biomonitoring are revised first. Thirdly, we propose to improve the impact of taxonomic revisions by publishing two papers addressing different readerships (general and specialists). We illustrate our proposals by carrying out a taxonomic revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore based on specimens obtained with Malaise traps placed at 107 sites across different habitats. We show that a first batch of specimens (N=1,456) contains 120 species, of which 115 are new to science and described in a separate taxonomic monograph. Species delimitation started with obtaining NGS barcodes (313-bp) that were used for estimating the number of MOTUs. This revealed 116-129 MOTUs depending on whether PTP, ABGD (P=0.001- 0.060), or objective clustering (2-5%) was used. Afterwards, we applied the &#34;LIT&#34; process (Large- scale Integrative Taxonomy) which optimizes the integration of morphological and molecular data by using the molecular data to identify which specimens should be studied morphologically. Applying LIT to 3% MOTUs revealed a match ratio of 91% between the MOTUs and putative morphospecies, but an even higher match ratio of 97% was found for MOTUs obtained with 5% Objective Clustering and ABGD (P=0.060). Using these parameters, only two MOTUs had to be fused for perfect congruence between molecular and morphological data for the 120 species. To test the completeness of our monograph, we then analyzed a second batch of 1,567 specimens. Here, all clustering algorithms and settings revealed only 20 additional MOTUs. This means that the first batch of specimens already covered 85% of the diversity, although 22% and 10% of the species are singletons or doubletons, respectively. Even more remarkable is that &gt;97% of all specimens in the second batch belonged to species described based on the first batch. The study thus demonstrates that revisions of dark taxa at moderate geographic scales with a moderate number of specimens from standardized traps can move dark taxa from being unavailable for biomonitoring to being well suited. Incidentally, the study also increases the number of described species of Mycetophilidae in the entire Oriental Region by &gt;25% indicating the size of taxonomic impediments for dark taxa in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">At least 20% of reptiles are currently threatened with extinction. Due to the lack of comprehensive global assessments of the group, they have been omitted from spatial studies, especially the ones addressing conservation or spatial prioritization. With the recent release of global assessments for reptiles, in this study, we calculate the probability of seven biodiversity threats - logging, pollution, agriculture, invasive species, hunting, climate change and urbanization occurring at a global scale on a 50x50km grid and their impact measured as the probability of finding a threatened species. Despite the global nature of our approach, we compartmented the terrestrial land into 12 regions and conducted separate analyses on each region. We find that despite globally low levels of intensity, climate change and invasive species have the highest impact on reptiles. But when looked at the regional level, various threats have a high impact on biodiversity, even surpassing climate change and invasives. Our study highlights the importance of going beyond measuring the intensity of threats to measure impact and also the importance of subdividing the world into smaller units and testing the impacts separately.</p>

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Open ended&#34; or &#34;dark taxa&#34; are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu &amp; Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu &amp; Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.</p>
