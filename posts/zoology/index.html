A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576855\nA free-swimming larval stage features in many marine invertebrate life cycles. To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.\nInvestments in photoreceptors compete with investments in optics to determine eye design\nAuthors: Heras, F. J. H.; Laughlin, S. B.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.576511\nBecause an animal invests in an eyes optics and photoreceptor array to meet behavioural needs at minimum cost, optics and photoreceptors compete for resources to maximise eye performance. This competition has not previously been investigated. Its outcome depends on the relative costs and benefits of investing space, materials and energy in optics and photoreceptors. We introduce a measure of cost, specific volume in {micro}m3 sr-1, which relates to performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. We model apposition compound eyes and simple (camera type) eyes to calculate the performance surface across the morphospace of eyes of given type and total cost. This surface identifies the allocation of resources that maximises efficiency and shows how efficiency reduces as eye morphology departs from optimum. Using published data, we calculate specific volumes to estimate the investments in optics and photoreceptors that insects make, and compare these with our models. We find that efficient allocation can explain three robust trends: fast flying diurnal insects allocate \u003e 50% of eye volume to photoreceptor arrays, their photoreceptors photosensitive waveguides (rhabdomeres, rhabdoms) are much longer than simple eyes, and length increases systematically with spatial resolution. We conclude that photoreceptor costs often equal or exceed optical costs, therefore competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources is a major factor in eye design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to maximise efficiency is a design principle. Our methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost:benefit lens.\nLaboratory evaluation of the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual (a deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net) against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae\nAuthors: Syme, T. W.; N'dombidje, B.; Todjinou, D.; Ariori, V.; Ngufor, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577674\nPyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets have been recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after an alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr net showed improved impact in epidemiological trials. PermaNet(R) Dual is a new deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net developed by Vestergaard Sarl to expand options to control programmes. We performed a series of laboratory studies according to WHO guidelines to assess the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual. Regeneration time was determined by subjecting net pieces to cone bioassays and tunnel tests before and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after washing. The wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual was evaluated compared to WHO-prequalified pyrethroid-only (PermaNet(R) 2.0) and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (Interceptor(R) G2) nets by testing net pieces washed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 times in cone bioassays and tunnel tests. Tests were performed with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae to separately assess the pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr components. Net pieces were also analysed to determine insecticide content. In regeneration time studies, the biological activity of the deltamethrin and chlorfenapyr components of PermaNet(R) Dual regenerated within 1 day after washing and a 1-day washing interval was adopted for wash-resistance studies. PermaNet(R) Dual induced high mortality (98%) and blood-feeding inhibition (98%) of the susceptible strain after 20 washes fulfilling WHO efficacy criteria in tunnel tests ([\u0026ge;]80% mortality, [\u0026ge;]90% blood-feeding inhibition). Similar results were obtained with PermaNet(R) 2.0 (99% mortality, 99% blood-feeding inhibition) and Interceptor(R) G2 (99% mortality, 98% blood-feeding inhibition) washed 20 times. In wash-resistance tunnel tests against the pyrethroid-resistant strain, PermaNet(R) Dual washed 20 times induced high mortality (91%) and blood-feeding inhibition (73%) which was similar to Interceptor(R) G2 (87% mortality, 79% blood-feeding inhibition) and superior to PermaNet(R) 2.0 (47% mortality, 68% blood-feeding inhibition). PermaNet(R) Dual fulfilled WHO efficacy criteria in laboratory bioassays and showed potential to improve control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors.\nNationwide surveillance identifies yellow fever and chikungunya viruses transmitted by various species of Aedes mosquitoes in Nigeria\nAuthors: Nwangwu, U.; Oguzie, J.

S.; Ifedayo, A.; Ihekweazu, C.; Happi, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575625\nBackgroundSince its reemergence in 2017, yellow fever (YF) has been active in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has coordinated responses to the outbreaks with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). The National Arbovirus and Vectors Research Centre (NAVRC) handles the vector component of these responses. This study sought to identify the vectors driving YF transmission and any of the targeted arboviruses and their distribution across states. MethodsEggs, larvae and pupae as well as adult mosquitoes were collected in observational, analytical, and cross-sectional surveys conducted in sixteen YF outbreak states between 2017 and 2020. Adult mosquitoes (field-collected or reared from immature stages) were morphologically identified, and arboviruses were detected using RT-qPCR at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID). ResultsAedes mosquitoes were collected in eleven of the sixteen states surveyed and the mosquitoes in nine states were found infected with arboviruses. A total of seven Aedes species were collected from different parts of the country. Aedes aegypti was the most dominant (51%) species, whereas Aedes africanus was the least (0.2%). Yellow fever virus (YFV) was discovered in 33 ([~]26%) out of the 127 Aedes mosquito pools. In addition to YFV, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was found in nine pools. Except for Ae. africanus, all the Aedes species tested positive for at least one arbovirus. YFV-positive pools were found in six (6) Aedes species while CHIKV-positive pools were only recorded in two Aedes species. Edo State had the most positive pools (16), while Nasarawa, Imo, and Anambra states had the least (1 positive pool). Breteau and house indices were higher than normal transmission thresholds in all but one state. ConclusionIn Nigeria, there is a substantial risk of arbovirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, with YFV posing the largest threat at the moment. This risk is heightened by the fact that YFV and CHIKV have been detected in vectors across outbreak locations. Hence, there is an urgent need to step up arbovirus surveillance and control activities in the country. Author summaryEpidemics of arboviral infections are fast becoming the norm across Africa, especially in Nigeria, where sporadic epidemics of Aedes-borne Yellow Fever (YF) have been on the rise since 2017. A nationwide surveillance was conducted to detect the arboviruses and the vectors transmitting them during large YF outbreaks across Nigeria. Aedes mosquitoes collected from 57 local government areas/outbreak locations, covering 16 out of the 36 states in Nigeria, were reared to adulthood, morphologically identified to species level and assayed using qRT-PCR to detect six epidemiologically important arboviruses (Dengue, Chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika, YF, West Nile and Onyong nyong). Seven Aedes species (including Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. circumluteolus, Ae. vittatus, Ae. simpsoni complex, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. africanus), were caught, with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus the most widespread and predominant. Only YF and CHKV were found in mosquito pools from 9 states, with only Ae. aegypti pools positive for CHKV, while YF virus was found predominantly in this species and Ae. albopictus. This study provides a baseline for widespread distribution of the major Aedes vectors, and their arboviral transmission profiles, which can enhance evidence-based control measures, and strengthen nationwide surveillance systems to forestall future outbreaks of public health magnitude.\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) - an updated record of butterfly for Saudi Arabia\nAuthors: ALFAKIH, A.; AL FAIFY, E. A.\nScore: 39.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572884\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A free-swimming larval stage features in many marine invertebrate life cycles. To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Because an animal invests in an eyes optics and photoreceptor array to meet behavioural needs at minimum cost, optics and photoreceptors compete for resources to maximise eye performance. This competition has not previously been investigated. Its outcome depends on the relative costs and benefits of investing space, materials and energy in optics and photoreceptors. We introduce a measure of cost, specific volume in {micro}m3 sr-1, which relates to performance via optical, physiological and geometrical constraints. We model apposition compound eyes and simple (camera type) eyes to calculate the performance surface across the morphospace of eyes of given type and total cost. This surface identifies the allocation of resources that maximises efficiency and shows how efficiency reduces as eye morphology departs from optimum. Using published data, we calculate specific volumes to estimate the investments in optics and photoreceptors that insects make, and compare these with our models. We find that efficient allocation can explain three robust trends: fast flying diurnal insects allocate &gt; 50% of eye volume to photoreceptor arrays, their photoreceptors photosensitive waveguides (rhabdomeres, rhabdoms) are much longer than simple eyes, and length increases systematically with spatial resolution. We conclude that photoreceptor costs often equal or exceed optical costs, therefore competition between optics and photoreceptors for resources is a major factor in eye design, and matching investments in optics and photoreceptors to maximise efficiency is a design principle. Our methodology can be developed to view the adaptive radiation of eyes through a cost:benefit lens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr nets have been recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organisation (WHO) after an alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr net showed improved impact in epidemiological trials. PermaNet(R) Dual is a new deltamethrin-chlorfenapyr net developed by Vestergaard Sarl to expand options to control programmes. We performed a series of laboratory studies according to WHO guidelines to assess the regeneration time, efficacy and wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual. Regeneration time was determined by subjecting net pieces to cone bioassays and tunnel tests before and 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after washing. The wash-resistance of PermaNet(R) Dual was evaluated compared to WHO-prequalified pyrethroid-only (PermaNet(R) 2.0) and pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr (Interceptor(R) G2) nets by testing net pieces washed 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 times in cone bioassays and tunnel tests. Tests were performed with susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae to separately assess the pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr components. Net pieces were also analysed to determine insecticide content. In regeneration time studies, the biological activity of the deltamethrin and chlorfenapyr components of PermaNet(R) Dual regenerated within 1 day after washing and a 1-day washing interval was adopted for wash-resistance studies. PermaNet(R) Dual induced high mortality (98%) and blood-feeding inhibition (98%) of the susceptible strain after 20 washes fulfilling WHO efficacy criteria in tunnel tests ([&amp;ge;]80% mortality, [&amp;ge;]90% blood-feeding inhibition). Similar results were obtained with PermaNet(R) 2.0 (99% mortality, 99% blood-feeding inhibition) and Interceptor(R) G2 (99% mortality, 98% blood-feeding inhibition) washed 20 times. In wash-resistance tunnel tests against the pyrethroid-resistant strain, PermaNet(R) Dual washed 20 times induced high mortality (91%) and blood-feeding inhibition (73%) which was similar to Interceptor(R) G2 (87% mortality, 79% blood-feeding inhibition) and superior to PermaNet(R) 2.0 (47% mortality, 68% blood-feeding inhibition). PermaNet(R) Dual fulfilled WHO efficacy criteria in laboratory bioassays and showed potential to improve control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundSince its reemergence in 2017, yellow fever (YF) has been active in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has coordinated responses to the outbreaks with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). The National Arbovirus and Vectors Research Centre (NAVRC) handles the vector component of these responses. This study sought to identify the vectors driving YF transmission and any of the targeted arboviruses and their distribution across states.

MethodsEggs, larvae and pupae as well as adult mosquitoes were collected in observational, analytical, and cross-sectional surveys conducted in sixteen YF outbreak states between 2017 and 2020. Adult mosquitoes (field-collected or reared from immature stages) were morphologically identified, and arboviruses were detected using RT-qPCR at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID).

ResultsAedes mosquitoes were collected in eleven of the sixteen states surveyed and the mosquitoes in nine states were found infected with arboviruses. A total of seven Aedes species were collected from different parts of the country. Aedes aegypti was the most dominant (51%) species, whereas Aedes africanus was the least (0.2%). Yellow fever virus (YFV) was discovered in 33 ([~]26%) out of the 127 Aedes mosquito pools. In addition to YFV, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was found in nine pools. Except for Ae. africanus, all the Aedes species tested positive for at least one arbovirus. YFV-positive pools were found in six (6) Aedes species while CHIKV-positive pools were only recorded in two Aedes species. Edo State had the most positive pools (16), while Nasarawa, Imo, and Anambra states had the least (1 positive pool). Breteau and house indices were higher than normal transmission thresholds in all but one state.

ConclusionIn Nigeria, there is a substantial risk of arbovirus transmission by Aedes mosquitoes, with YFV posing the largest threat at the moment. This risk is heightened by the fact that YFV and CHIKV have been detected in vectors across outbreak locations. Hence, there is an urgent need to step up arbovirus surveillance and control activities in the country.

Author summaryEpidemics of arboviral infections are fast becoming the norm across Africa, especially in Nigeria, where sporadic epidemics of Aedes-borne Yellow Fever (YF) have been on the rise since 2017. A nationwide surveillance was conducted to detect the arboviruses and the vectors transmitting them during large YF outbreaks across Nigeria. Aedes mosquitoes collected from 57 local government areas/outbreak locations, covering 16 out of the 36 states in Nigeria, were reared to adulthood, morphologically identified to species level and assayed using qRT-PCR to detect six epidemiologically important arboviruses (Dengue, Chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika, YF, West Nile and Onyong nyong). Seven Aedes species (including Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. circumluteolus, Ae. vittatus, Ae. simpsoni complex, Ae. luteocephalus, and Ae. africanus), were caught, with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus the most widespread and predominant. Only YF and CHKV were found in mosquito pools from 9 states, with only Ae. aegypti pools positive for CHKV, while YF virus was found predominantly in this species and Ae. albopictus. This study provides a baseline for widespread distribution of the major Aedes vectors, and their arboviral transmission profiles, which can enhance evidence-based control measures, and strengthen nationwide surveillance systems to forestall future outbreaks of public health magnitude.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.</p>
