J.; Seyer, Y.; Soos, C.; Ward, C. R. E.; Wells, R.; Wight, J.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574233\nIn 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.\nThe value of livestock abortion surveillance in Tanzania: identifying disease priorities and informing interventions\nAuthors: Lankester, F.; Kibona, T. J.; Allan, K. J.; de Glanville, W.; Buza, J. J.; Katzer, F.; Halliday, J. E.; Mmbaga, B. T.; Wheelhouse, N.; Innes, E. A.; Thomas, K.; Nyasebwa, O. M.; Swai, E.; Claxton, J. R.; Cleaveland, S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574517\nBackground: Lack of reliable data on the aetiology of livestock diseases, especially in Africa, is a major factor constraining the design of effective livestock health interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Rationale: Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome that affects productivity and livestock economies, and poses risks to public health. Worldwide, several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa livestock disease surveillance data rarely include information from abortion events, little is known about the aetiology and impacts of livestock abortions, and data are not available to inform prioritisation of disease interventions. Methods: This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform that was set up in 15 wards in northern Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder agro-ecological systems to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion cases were reported by farmers to Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries livestock field officers and on to investigation teams. The abortion was eligible for inclusion if the research field team or livestock field officer could attend within 72 hours of the event occurring. If so, a field investigation was carried out to collect diagnostic samples from aborted materials and aborting dams and questionnaire data on herd/flock management. Laboratory diagnostic tests were carried out for a range of abortigenic pathogens, and laboratory and questionnaire data analysed to investigate a) determinants of attribution; b) patterns of investigated events, including species and breed affected, history of previous abortion and recent stressful events, and the seasonality of cases; c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases in which zoonotic pathogens were detection. Results: Over a two-year period (2017-2019), 215 abortion events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44) and goats (n=100) were investigated from 13 of the 15 wards. The number of investigated cases varied widely across wards, with three of the 15 field officers (20%) reporting 70% of investigated cases. Aetiological attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases through PCR-based diagnostics, was significantly affected by delays in field investigation. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR diagnostics due to rapid deterioration of field samples. Vaginal swabs from aborting dams provided a practical and sensitive source of diagnostic material for pathogen detection. Discussion / Conclusion: Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale and when capturing only a small proportion of events, can generate valuable information on causes of zoonotic disease outbreaks, livestock reproductive losses and can identify important pathogens that are not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an effective reporting and investigation system that could be implemented across a range of settings, including remote rural areas, with engagement of community-based field officers, and establishment of practical sample collection protocols and molecular diagnostic platforms all being important elements of effectiveness.\nEffect of habitat degradation on hantavirus infection among introduced and endemic small mammals of Madagascar\nAuthors: Dubrulle, J. A.; Kauffman, K.; Soarimalala, V.; Randriamoria, T.; Goodman, S. M.; Herrera, J.; Nunn, C. L.; Tortosa, P.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573235\nHantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.\nNutritional characterisation and seasonal variation of goat forages in Central Malawi\nAuthors: Cooke, A. S.; Mvula, W.; Ventura-Cordero, J.; Gwiriri, L. C.; Takahashi, T.; Morgan, E. R.; Lee, M. R. F.; Safalaoh, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573017\nGoat ownership is prevalent across rural Malawi and provides a vital source of income, nutrition, and food security. However, goat performance is poor, and this presents a risk to individuals and communities who depend on them. Nutrition is fundamental to health and productivity of any livestock enterprise, it is required to be able to deal with stresses, such as disease, and to enable growth and production. The aim of this study was to characterise the nutritional profile of naturally available forages in Malawi, including the seasonal variation in nutrition. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over a 17-month period, across four villages (30 farms/smallholders) in Central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre fractions, and ash/organic matter and NDVI was used as a measure of forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability appeared most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. Whilst there were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, the drivers of this were unclear, but could be due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season represent a seasonal nutrition-gap which may result in risks to goat health and productivity. Whilst mitigating this through supplementation of persevered forages may be possible, this is a challenge due to limitations of resources and the fact that goats free-roam during the dry season.\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) - a new record of butterfly for Saudi Arabia\nAuthors: ALFAKIH, A.; AL FAIFY, E. A.\nScore: 38.3, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572884\nThe clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.\nA polytypic species revisited: Phylogenetic and morphological variation, taxonomic status, and geographical distribution of Trachops (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae)\nAuthors: Camacho, M. A.; Menendez-Guerrero, P. A.; Horvath, B.; Cadar, D.; Murienne, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574068\nThe taxonomic status of the neotropical bat genus Trachops has been reevaluated through an integrated study that incorporates morphological, morphometric, and molecular data across its extensive geographic range. Our research, which included previously unexamined regions, revealed substantial insights into the diversity within Trachops. The results support the elevation of T. cirrhosus ehrhardti to species status, due to genetic and morphological differences in southeastern Brazil specimens. Conversely, our comprehensive analysis found insufficient evidence to maintain the subspecific distinction of T. c. coffini, which lacks diagnosable morphological characters and is not genetically distinct from T. c. cirrhosus across its distribution range. Additionally, our findings challenge the previous belief of a latitudinal differentiation in body size for Trachops cirrhosus, as specimens from western South America and northeastern South America exhibit similar sizes to those from Central America. These results underscore the importance of revising the taxonomic framework for this bat genus, contributing to a more precise understanding of its evolutionary relationships, and further enhancing conservation efforts, considering the potential threats to the newly recognized T. ehrhardti in the imperiled Atlantic Forest of Brazil.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Lack of reliable data on the aetiology of livestock diseases, especially in Africa, is a major factor constraining the design of effective livestock health interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Rationale: Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome that affects productivity and livestock economies, and poses risks to public health. Worldwide, several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa livestock disease surveillance data rarely include information from abortion events, little is known about the aetiology and impacts of livestock abortions, and data are not available to inform prioritisation of disease interventions. Methods: This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform that was set up in 15 wards in northern Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder agro-ecological systems to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion cases were reported by farmers to Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries livestock field officers and on to investigation teams. The abortion was eligible for inclusion if the research field team or livestock field officer could attend within 72 hours of the event occurring. If so, a field investigation was carried out to collect diagnostic samples from aborted materials and aborting dams and questionnaire data on herd/flock management. Laboratory diagnostic tests were carried out for a range of abortigenic pathogens, and laboratory and questionnaire data analysed to investigate a) determinants of attribution; b) patterns of investigated events, including species and breed affected, history of previous abortion and recent stressful events, and the seasonality of cases; c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases in which zoonotic pathogens were detection. Results: Over a two-year period (2017-2019), 215 abortion events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44) and goats (n=100) were investigated from 13 of the 15 wards. The number of investigated cases varied widely across wards, with three of the 15 field officers (20%) reporting 70% of investigated cases. Aetiological attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases through PCR-based diagnostics, was significantly affected by delays in field investigation. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR diagnostics due to rapid deterioration of field samples. Vaginal swabs from aborting dams provided a practical and sensitive source of diagnostic material for pathogen detection. Discussion / Conclusion: Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale and when capturing only a small proportion of events, can generate valuable information on causes of zoonotic disease outbreaks, livestock reproductive losses and can identify important pathogens that are not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an effective reporting and investigation system that could be implemented across a range of settings, including remote rural areas, with engagement of community-based field officers, and establishment of practical sample collection protocols and molecular diagnostic platforms all being important elements of effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Goat ownership is prevalent across rural Malawi and provides a vital source of income, nutrition, and food security. However, goat performance is poor, and this presents a risk to individuals and communities who depend on them. Nutrition is fundamental to health and productivity of any livestock enterprise, it is required to be able to deal with stresses, such as disease, and to enable growth and production. The aim of this study was to characterise the nutritional profile of naturally available forages in Malawi, including the seasonal variation in nutrition. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over a 17-month period, across four villages (30 farms/smallholders) in Central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre fractions, and ash/organic matter and NDVI was used as a measure of forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability appeared most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. Whilst there were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, the drivers of this were unclear, but could be due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season represent a seasonal nutrition-gap which may result in risks to goat health and productivity. Whilst mitigating this through supplementation of persevered forages may be possible, this is a challenge due to limitations of resources and the fact that goats free-roam during the dry season.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The taxonomic status of the neotropical bat genus Trachops has been reevaluated through an integrated study that incorporates morphological, morphometric, and molecular data across its extensive geographic range. Our research, which included previously unexamined regions, revealed substantial insights into the diversity within Trachops. The results support the elevation of T. cirrhosus ehrhardti to species status, due to genetic and morphological differences in southeastern Brazil specimens. Conversely, our comprehensive analysis found insufficient evidence to maintain the subspecific distinction of T. c. coffini, which lacks diagnosable morphological characters and is not genetically distinct from T. c. cirrhosus across its distribution range. Additionally, our findings challenge the previous belief of a latitudinal differentiation in body size for Trachops cirrhosus, as specimens from western South America and northeastern South America exhibit similar sizes to those from Central America. These results underscore the importance of revising the taxonomic framework for this bat genus, contributing to a more precise understanding of its evolutionary relationships, and further enhancing conservation efforts, considering the potential threats to the newly recognized T. ehrhardti in the imperiled Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</p>
