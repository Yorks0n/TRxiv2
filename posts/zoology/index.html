M.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.17.545449\nMany species exhibit color polymorphisms which have distinct physiological and behavioral characteristics. However, the consistency of morph trait covariation patterns across species, time, and ecological contexts remains unclear. This trait covariation is especially relevant in the context of invasion biology and urban adaptation. Specifically, physiological and behavioral traits pertaining to energy maintenance are crucial to fitness, given their immediate ties to individual reproduction, growth, and population establishment. We investigated the physiological and behavioral traits of Podarcis muralis, a versatile color polymorphic species that thrives in urban environments (including invasive populations in Ohio, USA). We measured five physiological and behavioral traits (circulating corticosterone and triglycerides, hematocrit, body condition, and field body temperature) which compose an integrated multivariate phenotype. We then tested variation among stable color polymorphisms in the context of establishment in an urban environment. We found that the traits describing physiological status and strategy shifted across the active season in a morph-dependent manner-the white and yellow morphs exhibited clearly different multivariate physiological phenotypes, characterized primarily by differences in circulating corticosterone. This suggests that morphs have different strategies in physiological regulation, the flexibility of which is crucial to urban adaptation. The white-yellow morph exhibited an intermediate phenotype, suggesting an intermediary energy maintenance strategy. Orange morphs also exhibited distinct phenotypes, but the low prevalence of this morph in our study populations precludes clear interpretation. Our work provides insight into how differences among stable polymorphisms exist across axes of the phenotype and how this variation may aid in establishment within novel environments.

During the transition from the intramolluscan redia to the free-living cercaria stage in a complex life cycle of trematodes, extensive anatomical and behavioral modifications occur, enabling the cercaria to locate and infect the next host in the complex water environment. However, the functional changes that occur in the nervous system during this shift are not well understood. We used a de novo transcriptome to characterize the molecular building blocks of the trematode nervous system and identify pathways that may underlie differences in nervous system function between the rediae and cercariae stages of the Cryptocotyle lingua, marine trematode species causing problems for fisheries. Our results confirmed the streamlined molecular toolkit of these parasitic trematodes, including the absence of certain key signaling pathways and ion channels. We documented the loss of nitric oxide synthase not only in C. lingua but also in the entire phylum Platyhelminthes. We identified several neuronal genes upregulated in dispersal larvae, including genes involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, TRPA channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and surprisingly nitric oxide receptors soluble guanylate cyclase. Validation of these findings using neuronal markers and in situ hybridization allowed us to hypothesize the protein function in relation to the adaptations and host-finding strategy of the dispersal larva.
