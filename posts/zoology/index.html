  "articleBody": " Historical biogeography of New World Killifishes (Cyprinodontiformes: Funduloidea) recapitulates geographical history in the Gulf of Mexico watershed\nAuthors: Hernandez, S. G.; Hoagstrom, C. W.; Matamoros, W. A.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556706\nWe reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of superfamily Funduloidea with a synthesis of its biogeographic history. We used DNA sequences from five genes for 135 species, with four fossil calibrations, to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny. We estimated diversification rates, ancestral areas (Nearctic or Neotropical), and ancestral habitat (coastal or upland), for each node. Our results suggest that Funduloidea originated in the Late Cretaceous and diversified from Late Paleocene to present at a uniform rate, except Cyprinodontidae expressed an accelerated rate of speciation ~11.02 Ma. Neither viviparity, marine-to-freshwater transition, consistently accelerated speciation. Funduloidea has a coastal origin, but invaded inland many times. Funduloidea phylogeny indicates, sea-level falls isolate coastal populations, but increase island accessibility and climatic cooling facilitates invasions of temperate species into the tropics. For continental lineages, ancient river drainages accord with lineage distributions, including enigmatic disjunctions in Goodeidae and Fundulus. Niche shifts occurred from estuaries to open coasts and from forests to grasslands. Antiquity, adaptability, and dynamic geography can explain Funduloidea diversity. Combined environmental and phylogenetic data unveil the history of the Gulf of Mexico watershed. Phylogeny suggests there was diversification by barrier displacement and coastal speciation pump. Overall, speciation time, transitions to freshwater, dispersal, vicariance, adaptive radiation, and viviparity contributed to total diversification.\n\"Dark taxonomy\": a new protocol for overcoming the taxonomic impediments for dark taxa and broadening the taxon base for biodiversity assessment\nAuthors: Meier, R.; Srivathsan, A.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Amorim, D. d. S.\nScore: 37.6, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555664\nWe are entering the 6th mass extinction event on the planet with scarcely any data for \"dark taxa\" that comprise most animal species. These taxa have been neglected, because conventional taxonomic methods are not well-equipped to process tens of thousands of specimens belonging to thousands of species. We here test a new protocol for tackling the data deficiency problem for dark taxa by simultaneously addressing (1) taxonomic impediments, (2) lack of biodiversity baseline data, (3) and low impact of revisionary research. We propose to overcome the taxonomic impediments by carrying out revisions at small geographic scales to keep the number of specimens and species manageable. To lower the risk of taxonomic error, species delimitation and description are based on multiple data sources (\"integrative taxonomy\"). Secondly, we propose to create baseline data for dark taxa by initially revising them only based on fresh specimens obtained with the same sampling methods that are also used for biodiversity monitoring (e.g., Malaise traps for flying insects). This ensures that the revision constitutes a biodiversity baseline and the species most relevant for biomonitoring are revised first. Thirdly, we propose to improve the impact of taxonomic revisions by publishing two papers addressing different readerships (general and specialists). We illustrate our proposals by carrying out a taxonomic revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore based on specimens obtained with Malaise traps placed at 107 sites across different habitats. We show that a first batch of specimens (N=1,456) contains 120 species, of which 115 are new to science and described in a separate taxonomic monograph. Species delimitation started with obtaining NGS barcodes (313-bp) that were used for estimating the number of MOTUs. This revealed 116-129 MOTUs depending on whether PTP, ABGD (P=0.001- 0.060), or objective clustering (2-5%) was used. Afterwards, we applied the \"LIT\" process (Large- scale Integrative Taxonomy) which optimizes the integration of morphological and molecular data by using the molecular data to identify which specimens should be studied morphologically. Applying LIT to 3% MOTUs revealed a match ratio of 91% between the MOTUs and putative morphospecies, but an even higher match ratio of 97% was found for MOTUs obtained with 5% Objective Clustering and ABGD (P=0.060). Using these parameters, only two MOTUs had to be fused for perfect congruence between molecular and morphological data for the 120 species. To test the completeness of our monograph, we then analyzed a second batch of 1,567 specimens. Here, all clustering algorithms and settings revealed only 20 additional MOTUs. This means that the first batch of specimens already covered 85% of the diversity, although 22% and 10% of the species are singletons or doubletons, respectively. Even more remarkable is that \u003e97% of all specimens in the second batch belonged to species described based on the first batch. The study thus demonstrates that revisions of dark taxa at moderate geographic scales with a moderate number of specimens from standardized traps can move dark taxa from being unavailable for biomonitoring to being well suited. Incidentally, the study also increases the number of described species of Mycetophilidae in the entire Oriental Region by \u003e25% indicating the size of taxonomic impediments for dark taxa in Southeast Asia.\nPersonality heterophily and friendship as drivers for successful cooperation\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Waasdorp, S.; Middelburg, E.; Sterck, E. H. M.; Massen, J. J. M.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558534\nCooperation is widespread and arguably a pivotal evolutionary force in maintaining animal societies. Yet, proximately, what underlying motivators drive individuals to cooperate remains relatively unclear. Since 'free-riders' can exploit the benefits by cheating, selecting the right partner is paramount. Such decision rules need not be based on complex calculations and can be driven by cognitively less-demanding mechanisms, like social relationships (e.g., kinship, non-kin friendships, dyadic tolerance), social status (e.g., dominance hierarchies) and personalities (social and non-social traits); however, holistic evidence related to those mechanisms is scarce. Using the classical 'loose-string paradigm', we tested cooperative tendencies of a hierarchical primate, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). We studied three groups (n=32) in social settings, allowing free partner choice. We supplemented cooperation with observational and experimental data on social relationships, dominance hierarchies, and personality. Friendship and dissimilarity in a non-social 'exploration' personality trait predicted the likelihood of cooperative dyad formation. Furthermore, the magnitude of cooperative success was positively associated with friendship, low rank-distance, and dissimilarity in an 'activity-sociability' personality trait. Kinship did not affect cooperation. While some findings align with prior studies, the evidence of (non-social)personality heterophily promoting cooperation may deepen our understanding of the proximate mechanisms and, broadly, the evolution of cooperation.\nAn integrative taxonomic treatment of the Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) from Singapore reveals 115 new species on 730km2\nAuthors: Amorim, D. d. S.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Srivathsan, A.; Meier, R.\nScore: 48.9, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.555672\n\"Open ended\" or \"dark taxa\" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycomyinae); Allodia glorialimae, sp. n.; Brachycampta murphyi, sp. n.; Brachycampta limtzepengi, sp. n.; Brachycampta teopohlengi, sp. n.; Exechia tanswiehiani, sp. n.; Exechia alinewongae, sp. n.; Mycetophila chngseoktinae, sp. n.; Mycetophila georgettechenae, sp. n.; Mycetophila aishae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne phanwaithongae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne gohsookhimae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne rahimahae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne lynetteseahae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne neilaae, sp. n.; Platyprosthiogyne snehalethaae, sp. n.; Platurocypta adeleneweeae, sp. n.; Platurocypta tanhoweliangi, sp. n.; Epicypta constancesingamae, sp. n.; Epicypta jennylauae, sp. n.; Epicypta limchiumeiae, sp. n.; Epicypta janetyeeae, sp. n.; Epicypta kohkhenglianae, sp. n.; Epicypta daintoni, sp. n.; Epicypta holltumi, sp.n.; Epicypta alii, sp. n.; Epicypta ridleyi, sp. n.; Epicypta chezaharaae, sp. n.; Epicypta tanjiakkimi, sp. n.; Epicypta gehminae, sp. n.; Epicypta jackieyingae, sp. n.; Epicypta khatijunae, sp. n.; Epicypta purchoni, sp. n.; Epicypta foomaoshengi, sp. n.; Epicypta ganengsengi, sp. n.; Epicypta nanyangu, sp. n.; Epicypta nus, sp. n.; Epicypta peterngi, sp. n.; Epicypta maggielimae, sp. n.; Epicypta yupeigaoae, sp. n.; Epicypta annwee, sp. n.; Epicypta wallacei, sp. n.; Epicypta lamtoongjini, sp. n.; Epicypta catherinelimae, sp. n.; Epicypta grootaerti, sp. n.; Epicypta joaquimae, sp. n.; Aspidionia cheesweeleeae, sp. n.; Aspidionia janetjesudasonae, sp. n.; Aspidionia fatimahae, sp. n.; Integricypta fergusondavie, sp. n.; Integricypta teosoonkimae, sp. n.; Integricypta shirinae, sp. n.; Integricypta hoyuenhoeae, sp. n. (Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu \u0026 Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu \u0026 Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of superfamily Funduloidea with a synthesis of its biogeographic history. We used DNA sequences from five genes for 135 species, with four fossil calibrations, to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny. We estimated diversification rates, ancestral areas (Nearctic or Neotropical), and ancestral habitat (coastal or upland), for each node. Our results suggest that Funduloidea originated in the Late Cretaceous and diversified from Late Paleocene to present at a uniform rate, except Cyprinodontidae expressed an accelerated rate of speciation ~11.02 Ma. Neither viviparity, marine-to-freshwater transition, consistently accelerated speciation. Funduloidea has a coastal origin, but invaded inland many times. Funduloidea phylogeny indicates, sea-level falls isolate coastal populations, but increase island accessibility and climatic cooling facilitates invasions of temperate species into the tropics. For continental lineages, ancient river drainages accord with lineage distributions, including enigmatic disjunctions in Goodeidae and Fundulus. Niche shifts occurred from estuaries to open coasts and from forests to grasslands. Antiquity, adaptability, and dynamic geography can explain Funduloidea diversity. Combined environmental and phylogenetic data unveil the history of the Gulf of Mexico watershed. Phylogeny suggests there was diversification by barrier displacement and coastal speciation pump. Overall, speciation time, transitions to freshwater, dispersal, vicariance, adaptive radiation, and viviparity contributed to total diversification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We are entering the 6th mass extinction event on the planet with scarcely any data for &#34;dark taxa&#34; that comprise most animal species. These taxa have been neglected, because conventional taxonomic methods are not well-equipped to process tens of thousands of specimens belonging to thousands of species. We here test a new protocol for tackling the data deficiency problem for dark taxa by simultaneously addressing (1) taxonomic impediments, (2) lack of biodiversity baseline data, (3) and low impact of revisionary research. We propose to overcome the taxonomic impediments by carrying out revisions at small geographic scales to keep the number of specimens and species manageable. To lower the risk of taxonomic error, species delimitation and description are based on multiple data sources (&#34;integrative taxonomy&#34;). Secondly, we propose to create baseline data for dark taxa by initially revising them only based on fresh specimens obtained with the same sampling methods that are also used for biodiversity monitoring (e.g., Malaise traps for flying insects). This ensures that the revision constitutes a biodiversity baseline and the species most relevant for biomonitoring are revised first. Thirdly, we propose to improve the impact of taxonomic revisions by publishing two papers addressing different readerships (general and specialists). We illustrate our proposals by carrying out a taxonomic revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore based on specimens obtained with Malaise traps placed at 107 sites across different habitats. We show that a first batch of specimens (N=1,456) contains 120 species, of which 115 are new to science and described in a separate taxonomic monograph. Species delimitation started with obtaining NGS barcodes (313-bp) that were used for estimating the number of MOTUs. This revealed 116-129 MOTUs depending on whether PTP, ABGD (P=0.001- 0.060), or objective clustering (2-5%) was used. Afterwards, we applied the &#34;LIT&#34; process (Large- scale Integrative Taxonomy) which optimizes the integration of morphological and molecular data by using the molecular data to identify which specimens should be studied morphologically. Applying LIT to 3% MOTUs revealed a match ratio of 91% between the MOTUs and putative morphospecies, but an even higher match ratio of 97% was found for MOTUs obtained with 5% Objective Clustering and ABGD (P=0.060). Using these parameters, only two MOTUs had to be fused for perfect congruence between molecular and morphological data for the 120 species. To test the completeness of our monograph, we then analyzed a second batch of 1,567 specimens. Here, all clustering algorithms and settings revealed only 20 additional MOTUs. This means that the first batch of specimens already covered 85% of the diversity, although 22% and 10% of the species are singletons or doubletons, respectively. Even more remarkable is that &gt;97% of all specimens in the second batch belonged to species described based on the first batch. The study thus demonstrates that revisions of dark taxa at moderate geographic scales with a moderate number of specimens from standardized traps can move dark taxa from being unavailable for biomonitoring to being well suited. Incidentally, the study also increases the number of described species of Mycetophilidae in the entire Oriental Region by &gt;25% indicating the size of taxonomic impediments for dark taxa in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cooperation is widespread and arguably a pivotal evolutionary force in maintaining animal societies. Yet, proximately, what underlying motivators drive individuals to cooperate remains relatively unclear. Since &#39;free-riders&#39; can exploit the benefits by cheating, selecting the right partner is paramount. Such decision rules need not be based on complex calculations and can be driven by cognitively less-demanding mechanisms, like social relationships (e.g., kinship, non-kin friendships, dyadic tolerance), social status (e.g., dominance hierarchies) and personalities (social and non-social traits); however, holistic evidence related to those mechanisms is scarce. Using the classical &#39;loose-string paradigm&#39;, we tested cooperative tendencies of a hierarchical primate, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). We studied three groups (n=32) in social settings, allowing free partner choice. We supplemented cooperation with observational and experimental data on social relationships, dominance hierarchies, and personality. Friendship and dissimilarity in a non-social &#39;exploration&#39; personality trait predicted the likelihood of cooperative dyad formation. Furthermore, the magnitude of cooperative success was positively associated with friendship, low rank-distance, and dissimilarity in an &#39;activity-sociability&#39; personality trait. Kinship did not affect cooperation. While some findings align with prior studies, the evidence of (non-social)personality heterophily promoting cooperation may deepen our understanding of the proximate mechanisms and, broadly, the evolution of cooperation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Open ended&#34; or &#34;dark taxa&#34; are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu &amp; Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu &amp; Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.</p>
