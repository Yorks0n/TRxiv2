To address this issue, sequencing, and analysis of the 18S rRNA gene of ciliates have been used as an alternative. However, this method has limitations because the highly conserved nature of this gene makes it challenging to achieve species-level resolution. This study assesses the capability of two internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2, along with the 28S rRNA gene, to enhance the taxonomic resolution beyond that offered by the 18S rRNA gene in free-living and host-associated ciliates. ResultsWe compared sequences of ITSI, ITS2, and the 18S and the 28S rRNA genes downloaded from public databases and found that ITS1 and ITS2 are more divergent at both inter- and intra-specific levels than the 18S rRNA gene. We designed universal primers specific to the two ITS regions and the 28S rRNA gene for free-living and rumen ciliates. We then systematically evaluated these primers using in-silico analysis, PCR assays, and metataxonomic or metabarcoding analysis and compared them to universal 18S rRNA gene primers. We found that the new primers are specific and inclusive, with an inclusiveness rate of over 80% based on in-silico analysis and confirmed their specificity using PCR evaluation. We validated the new primers with metagenomic DNA from freshwater samples and from rumen samples. Our metataxonomic analysis demonstrated that the ITS regions and the 28S rRNA gene could reveal greater ciliate diversity than the 18S rRNA gene in both environments. In particular, ITS1 detected the highest number of ciliate species, including species and genera that were not detected by the 18S rRNA gene. ConclusionsThe ITS regions, particularly ITS1, offer superior taxonomic resolution, and the NCBI ITS RefSeq database allows more species to be classified. Therefore, ITS1, and to a lesser extent ITS2, is recommended for enhancing metataxonomic analysis of ciliate communities in both freshwater and rumen environments.\nFecundity Estimation of Atlantic mudskipper Periophthalmus barbarus in Ogbo-Okolo mangrove Forest of Santa Barbara River, Bayelsa State Niger Delta, Nigeria\nAuthors: Nathaniel, A. M.; Soberekon, I. J.; Gamage, I. E.; Eli, A. A.; Raimi, M. O.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578404\nRationaleFecundity estimation and reproductive biology of Atlantic mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarus) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria needs to be studied. ObjectivesTo estimate fecundity, gonadosomatic index, and condition factor of P. barbarus and describe its reproductive biology. MethodsP. barbarus specimens were collected from Ogbo-Okolo mangrove forest in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Length, weight, and gonad weight measurements were taken. Fecundity was estimated by the gravimetric method. Length-weight relationship, condition factor, and gonadosomatic index were calculated. Ovarian developmental stages were identified. ResultsHighest mean fecundity of 9612.7 eggs was observed in females of 10.1-12.0 cm standard length and 20.0-27.9 g weight. Length-weight relationship showed specimens were in good condition. Gonadosomatic index was higher in smaller individuals. Four ovarian developmental stages were identified. ConclusionP. barbarus exhibits high fecundity. Reproductive potential is greater in intermediate sized individuals compared to smaller or larger fish. RecommendationsSustainable management practices should be implemented to conserve P. barbarus stocks in the Niger Delta region. Further research into reproductive behavior and ecology is needed.\nEffect of environmental conditions on the wing morphometric variation in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in India\nAuthors: Sharma, G.; Sarma, D. K.; Bhutiani, R.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578359\nAedes aegypti an efficient vector of different arboviral diseases, is a major concern for public health globally. Originating from Africa, this vector has now invaded most of the parts of the world, which shows its thriving adaptability against diverse ecological conditions. In India too, Ae. aegypti has been found almost everywhere and along with Ae. albopictus, it contributed more than 0.2 million cases of dengue in the year 2022. Due to heterogeneous environmental settings in India, this vector has shown various intraspecific variations including its behavioral, genetic, and physiological characteristics. Thus, the present study hypothesized that there will be some differences in wing morphometrics across the country for this species. Considering this, we have sampled adults and immatures of Ae. aegypti from 11 distinct locations, representing six varied climatic regions of India. The immatures were reared to adult and the right wing was used to score the morphometric variations. A significant variation in wing size and shape was observed. The Himalayan region (Srinagar CS: 1.92 {+/-} 0.08 mm) supports the shortest (CS: 2.04 {+/-} 0.09 mm) wing size mosquitoes while the Deccan Peninsular region (Nagpur CS: 4.48 {+/-} 0.06 mm) exhibits the largest (CS: 4.46 {+/-} 0.10 mm) wing size mosquito. After excluding the allometric effect, the semi-desert region (Kota) showed the greatest wide variety of wing shapes corresponding to a larger morphospace in CVA analysis. In addition, region-wise wing size was found positively correlated with temperature (64%) and altitude (82%) but no directional trend was detected for wing shape characteristics. Conclusively, the study suggests the existence of varied population structures of Ae. aegypti in India based on wing morphometric analysis. This finding will be helpful towards focused actions and early measures to reduce the impact of these diseases carrying mosquitoes on public health.\nMicroalgal biofilm induces larval settlement in the model marine worm Platynereis dumerilii\nAuthors: Hird, C.; Jekely, G.; Williams, E. A.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576855\nA free-swimming larval stage features in many marine invertebrate life cycles. To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.\nHow smart was T. rex? Testing claims of exceptional cognition in dinosaurs and the application of neuron count estimates in palaeontological research\nAuthors: Caspar, K. R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 67.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\n",

        <p class="abstract">RationaleFecundity estimation and reproductive biology of Atlantic mudskippers (Periophthalmus barbarus) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria needs to be studied.

ObjectivesTo estimate fecundity, gonadosomatic index, and condition factor of P. barbarus and describe its reproductive biology.

MethodsP. barbarus specimens were collected from Ogbo-Okolo mangrove forest in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Length, weight, and gonad weight measurements were taken. Fecundity was estimated by the gravimetric method. Length-weight relationship, condition factor, and gonadosomatic index were calculated. Ovarian developmental stages were identified.

ResultsHighest mean fecundity of 9612.7 eggs was observed in females of 10.1-12.0 cm standard length and 20.0-27.9 g weight. Length-weight relationship showed specimens were in good condition. Gonadosomatic index was higher in smaller individuals. Four ovarian developmental stages were identified.

ConclusionP. barbarus exhibits high fecundity. Reproductive potential is greater in intermediate sized individuals compared to smaller or larger fish.

RecommendationsSustainable management practices should be implemented to conserve P. barbarus stocks in the Niger Delta region. Further research into reproductive behavior and ecology is needed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aedes aegypti an efficient vector of different arboviral diseases, is a major concern for public health globally. Originating from Africa, this vector has now invaded most of the parts of the world, which shows its thriving adaptability against diverse ecological conditions. In India too, Ae. aegypti has been found almost everywhere and along with Ae. albopictus, it contributed more than 0.2 million cases of dengue in the year 2022. Due to heterogeneous environmental settings in India, this vector has shown various intraspecific variations including its behavioral, genetic, and physiological characteristics. Thus, the present study hypothesized that there will be some differences in wing morphometrics across the country for this species. Considering this, we have sampled adults and immatures of Ae. aegypti from 11 distinct locations, representing six varied climatic regions of India. The immatures were reared to adult and the right wing was used to score the morphometric variations. A significant variation in wing size and shape was observed. The Himalayan region (Srinagar CS: 1.92 {&#43;/-} 0.08 mm) supports the shortest (CS: 2.04 {&#43;/-} 0.09 mm) wing size mosquitoes while the Deccan Peninsular region (Nagpur CS: 4.48 {&#43;/-} 0.06 mm) exhibits the largest (CS: 4.46 {&#43;/-} 0.10 mm) wing size mosquito. After excluding the allometric effect, the semi-desert region (Kota) showed the greatest wide variety of wing shapes corresponding to a larger morphospace in CVA analysis. In addition, region-wise wing size was found positively correlated with temperature (64%) and altitude (82%) but no directional trend was detected for wing shape characteristics. Conclusively, the study suggests the existence of varied population structures of Ae. aegypti in India based on wing morphometric analysis. This finding will be helpful towards focused actions and early measures to reduce the impact of these diseases carrying mosquitoes on public health.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A free-swimming larval stage features in many marine invertebrate life cycles. To transition to a seafloor-dwelling juvenile stage, larvae need to settle out of the plankton, guided by specific environmental cues that lead them to an ideal habitat for their future life on the seafloor. Although the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii has been cultured in research labs since the 1950s and has a free-swimming larval stage, specific environmental cues that induce settlement in this nereid worm are yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that microalgal biofilm is a key settlement cue for P. dumerilii larvae, inducing earlier onset of settlement, and enhancing subsequent juvenile growth as a primary food source. We tested the settlement response of P. dumerilii to 40 different strains of microalgae, predominantly diatom species, finding that P. dumerilii have species-specific preferences in their choice of settlement substrate. The most effective diatom species for inducing P. dumerilii larval settlement were benthic pennate species including Grammatophora marina, Achnanthes brevipes, and Nitzschia ovalis. The identification of specific environmental cues for P. dumerilii settlement enables a link between its ecology and the sensory and nervous system signalling that regulate larval behaviour and development. Incorporation of diatoms into P. dumerilii culture practices will improve the husbandry of this marine invertebrate model.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with &#34;macaque- or baboon-like cognition&#34; whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.</p>
