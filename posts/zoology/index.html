S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Srivathsan, A.; Meier, R.\nScore: 38.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.555672\n\"Open ended\" or \"dark taxa\" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu \u0026 Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu \u0026 Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\nHigh resolution longitudinal molecular and morphological tracking of planktonic threats to salmon aquaculture.\nAuthors: Alguero-Muniz, M.; Spatharis, S.; Dwyer, T.; de Noia, M.; Cheaib, B.; Robertson, B.; Johnstone, C.; Welsh, J.; Macphee, A.; Mazurkiewicz, M.; Bickerdike, R.; Migaud, H.; McGhee, C.; Praebel, K.; Llewellyn, M. S.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556215\nMarine phase salmonid aquaculture is a major component of the coastal economies of Northern Europe, North America and Chile and is under threat from numerous challenges to gill health, many of which originate from the phyto and zooplankton. Associated losses are growing as a proportion of production year on year. A first step towards mitigating losses is to characterize the biological drivers of poor gill health. Numerous planktonic species have been implicated, including toxic and siliceous microalgae, hydrozoans and scyphozoans; however, rigorous longitudinal surveys of planktonic diversity and gill health have been lacking. In the current study, we present and assess an exhaustive identification approach combining both morphological and molecular methods (environmental DNA metabarcoding) approaches in combination with robust statistical models to identify the planktonic drivers of complex gill disease (CGD) and fish mortality. We undertook longitudinal molecular and microscopic evaluation at two marine aquaculture facilities on the west coast of Scotland using daily data collected during the 2021 growing season (March to October). Examining these two different sites, one sheltered and one exposed to the open sea, we identified new, important, and unexpected planktonic drivers (e.g. doliolids and appendicularians) of CGD and mortality and confirmed the significance of some established threats (e.g. hydrozoans and diatoms). We also explored delayed or lagged effects of planktonic abundances on gill health and undertook a comparison of environmental DNA metabarcoding and microscopy in their ability to identify and quantify planktonic species. Our data highlight the diversity of planktonic threats to salmonid aquaculture as well as the importance of using both molecular and morphological approaches to detect those. Despite our study relying on two farm sites only, our results evidence the role of the different planktonic players on salmon gill disease; there is now an urgent need to expand systematic longitudinal molecular and morphological approach across multiple sites and over multiple years. The resultant catalogue of main biological drivers will enable early warning systems, new treatments and, ultimately, a sustainable platform for future salmonid aquaculture in the marine environment.\nHeat Tolerance is Affected by the Gut Microbiota in a Vertebrate Ectotherm\nAuthors: Dallas, J. W.; Kazarina, A.; Lee, S. T. M.; Warne, R. W.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556683\nThe gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.\nIdentification of human skin microbiome odorants that manipulate mosquito landing behavior\nAuthors: Coutinho-Abreu, I. V.; Jamshidi, O.; Raban, R.; Atabakhsh, K.; Merriman, J. A.; Fischbach, M. A.; Akbari, O. S.\nScore: 47.8, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553996\nThe resident human skin microbiome is responsible for the production of most of the human scents that are attractive to mosquitoes. Hence, engineering the human skin microbiome to synthesize less of mosquito attractants or produce repellents could potentially reduce bites and prevent the transmission of deadly mosquito-borne pathogens. In order to further characterize the human skin volatilome, we quantified the major volatiles of 39 strains of skin commensals (Staphylococci and Corynebacterium). Importantly, to validate the behavioral activity of these volatiles, we first assessed landing behavior triggered by human skin bacteria volatiles. We demonstrated that this behavioral step is gated by the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid, similar to the combinatorial coding triggering short range attraction. Repellency behavior to selected skin volatiles and terpenes was tested in the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid. In a 2-choice landing behavior context, the skin volatiles 2- and 3-methyl butyric acids reduced mosquito landing by 62.0-81.6% and 87.1-99.6%, respectively. Similarly, the terpene geraniol was capable of reducing mosquito landing behavior by 74.9%. We also tested the potential repellency effects of terpenes on mosquitoes at short-range using a 4-port olfactometer. In these assays, geraniol reduced mosquito attraction (69-78%) to a mixture of key human kairomones carbon dioxide, L-(+)-lactic acid, and ammonia. These findings demonstrate that carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid changes the valence of other skin volatiles towards mosquito landing behavior. Moreover, this study offers candidate odorants to be targeted in a novel strategy to reduce attractants or produce repellents by the human skin microbiota that may curtail mosquito bites, and subsequent mosquito-borne disease.\n",

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Open ended&#34; or &#34;dark taxa&#34; are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu &amp; Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu &amp; Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Marine phase salmonid aquaculture is a major component of the coastal economies of Northern Europe, North America and Chile and is under threat from numerous challenges to gill health, many of which originate from the phyto and zooplankton. Associated losses are growing as a proportion of production year on year. A first step towards mitigating losses is to characterize the biological drivers of poor gill health. Numerous planktonic species have been implicated, including toxic and siliceous microalgae, hydrozoans and scyphozoans; however, rigorous longitudinal surveys of planktonic diversity and gill health have been lacking. In the current study, we present and assess an exhaustive identification approach combining both morphological and molecular methods (environmental DNA metabarcoding) approaches in combination with robust statistical models to identify the planktonic drivers of complex gill disease (CGD) and fish mortality. We undertook longitudinal molecular and microscopic evaluation at two marine aquaculture facilities on the west coast of Scotland using daily data collected during the 2021 growing season (March to October). Examining these two different sites, one sheltered and one exposed to the open sea, we identified new, important, and unexpected planktonic drivers (e.g. doliolids and appendicularians) of CGD and mortality and confirmed the significance of some established threats (e.g. hydrozoans and diatoms). We also explored delayed or lagged effects of planktonic abundances on gill health and undertook a comparison of environmental DNA metabarcoding and microscopy in their ability to identify and quantify planktonic species. Our data highlight the diversity of planktonic threats to salmonid aquaculture as well as the importance of using both molecular and morphological approaches to detect those. Despite our study relying on two farm sites only, our results evidence the role of the different planktonic players on salmon gill disease; there is now an urgent need to expand systematic longitudinal molecular and morphological approach across multiple sites and over multiple years. The resultant catalogue of main biological drivers will enable early warning systems, new treatments and, ultimately, a sustainable platform for future salmonid aquaculture in the marine environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The resident human skin microbiome is responsible for the production of most of the human scents that are attractive to mosquitoes. Hence, engineering the human skin microbiome to synthesize less of mosquito attractants or produce repellents could potentially reduce bites and prevent the transmission of deadly mosquito-borne pathogens. In order to further characterize the human skin volatilome, we quantified the major volatiles of 39 strains of skin commensals (Staphylococci and Corynebacterium). Importantly, to validate the behavioral activity of these volatiles, we first assessed landing behavior triggered by human skin bacteria volatiles. We demonstrated that this behavioral step is gated by the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(&#43;)-lactic acid, similar to the combinatorial coding triggering short range attraction. Repellency behavior to selected skin volatiles and terpenes was tested in the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(&#43;)-lactic acid. In a 2-choice landing behavior context, the skin volatiles 2- and 3-methyl butyric acids reduced mosquito landing by 62.0-81.6% and 87.1-99.6%, respectively. Similarly, the terpene geraniol was capable of reducing mosquito landing behavior by 74.9%. We also tested the potential repellency effects of terpenes on mosquitoes at short-range using a 4-port olfactometer. In these assays, geraniol reduced mosquito attraction (69-78%) to a mixture of key human kairomones carbon dioxide, L-(&#43;)-lactic acid, and ammonia. These findings demonstrate that carbon dioxide and L-(&#43;)-lactic acid changes the valence of other skin volatiles towards mosquito landing behavior. Moreover, this study offers candidate odorants to be targeted in a novel strategy to reduce attractants or produce repellents by the human skin microbiota that may curtail mosquito bites, and subsequent mosquito-borne disease.</p>
