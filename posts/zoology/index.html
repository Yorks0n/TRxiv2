R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 63.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\nEndangered Przewalski's horse, Equus przewalskii, cloned from historically cryopreserved cells\nAuthors: Novak, B. J.; Ryder, O. A.; Houck, M. L.; Putnam, A. S.; Walker, K.; Russell, L.; Russell, B.; Walker, S.; Arenivas, S. S.; Aston, L.; Veneklasen, G.; Ivy, J. A.; Koepfli, K.-P.; Rusnak, A.; Simek, J.; Zhuk, A.; Phelan, R.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572538\nTwo endangered Przewalskis horse stallions were cloned from fibroblast cells cultured and cryopreserved in 1980. These stallions are clones of a male that lived from 1975-1998 that pedigree analyses identified as a genetically valuable male for present-day conservation breeding. This is the first time that multiple healthy clones have been produced for an endangered species.\nSex change every year: A unique reproductive strategy of the stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia (Euphyllia) ancor\nAuthors: Shikina, S.; Tsai, P.-H.; Chiu, Y.-L.; Chang, C.-F.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573442\nThe present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.\nThermal Tolerance Plasticity and Dynamics of Thermal Tolerance in Eublepharis macularius: Implications for Future Climate-Driven Heat Stress\nAuthors: White, E.; Kim, S.; Wegh, G.; Chiari, Y.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575519\nThe intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 hours from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass. Our findings contribute to the increasing body of work focused on understanding the influence of biological and environmental factors on thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms and provide phenotypic data to further investigate the molecular basis of thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms.\nEntomological surveys and insecticide susceptibility profile of Aedes aegypti during the dengue outbreak in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022\nAuthors: Kamgang, B.; Acantara, J.; Tedjou, A.; Keumeni, C.; Yougang, A.; Ancia, A.; Bigirimana, F.; Clarke, S.; Gil, V. S.; Wondji, C.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574582\nBackgroundThe first dengue outbreak was reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022. This study was undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. Methodology/Principal FindingsEntomological surveys were performed in all the seven health districts of Sao tome and Principe during the dry and rainy seasons in 2022. WHO tube and synergist assays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were carried out and the genotyping of F1534C/V1016I/V410L mutations in Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers. In both survey periods, the Breteau (BI \u003e 50), house (HI \u003e 35%) and container (CI \u003e 20%) indices were higher than threshold established by WHO to indicate high potential risk of dengue transmission. Aedes aegypti sample was susceptible to all insecticides tested except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (9.2% mortality), bendiocarb (61.4% mortality) and alpha-cypermethrin (97% mortality). A full recovery was reported in Ae. aegypti resistant to bendiocarb after pre-exposure to synergist PBO. Only one Ae. aegypti specimen was found carrying F1534C mutation. Conclusions/SignificanceThese findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year, with the bulk of larval breeding occurring in used tyres, water storage and discarded containers. Most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except DDT and bendiocarb. These data underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion. Author SummaryDuring the first dengue outbreak reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022, entomological investigations were undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. The results revealed the presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers suggesting a good waste management and improving water supply system could help to reduce Aedes densities and the risk of dengue transmission. Analyses also revealed that most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and bendiocarb. These findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year and underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Two endangered Przewalskis horse stallions were cloned from fibroblast cells cultured and cryopreserved in 1980. These stallions are clones of a male that lived from 1975-1998 that pedigree analyses identified as a genetically valuable male for present-day conservation breeding. This is the first time that multiple healthy clones have been produced for an endangered species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 hours from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass. Our findings contribute to the increasing body of work focused on understanding the influence of biological and environmental factors on thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms and provide phenotypic data to further investigate the molecular basis of thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe first dengue outbreak was reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022. This study was undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEntomological surveys were performed in all the seven health districts of Sao tome and Principe during the dry and rainy seasons in 2022. WHO tube and synergist assays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were carried out and the genotyping of F1534C/V1016I/V410L mutations in Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers. In both survey periods, the Breteau (BI &gt; 50), house (HI &gt; 35%) and container (CI &gt; 20%) indices were higher than threshold established by WHO to indicate high potential risk of dengue transmission. Aedes aegypti sample was susceptible to all insecticides tested except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (9.2% mortality), bendiocarb (61.4% mortality) and alpha-cypermethrin (97% mortality). A full recovery was reported in Ae. aegypti resistant to bendiocarb after pre-exposure to synergist PBO. Only one Ae. aegypti specimen was found carrying F1534C mutation.

Conclusions/SignificanceThese findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year, with the bulk of larval breeding occurring in used tyres, water storage and discarded containers. Most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except DDT and bendiocarb. These data underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.

Author SummaryDuring the first dengue outbreak reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022, entomological investigations were undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. The results revealed the presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers suggesting a good waste management and improving water supply system could help to reduce Aedes densities and the risk of dengue transmission. Analyses also revealed that most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and bendiocarb. These findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year and underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.</p>
