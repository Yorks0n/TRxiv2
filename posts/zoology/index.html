V.; Jamshidi, O.; Raban, R.; Atabakhsh, K.; Merriman, J. A.; Fischbach, M. A.; Akbari, O. S.\nScore: 43.0, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553996\nThe resident human skin microbiome is responsible for the production of most of the human scents that are attractive to mosquitoes. Hence, engineering the human skin microbiome to synthesize less of mosquito attractants or produce repellents could potentially reduce bites and prevent the transmission of deadly mosquito-borne pathogens. In order to further characterize the human skin volatilome, we quantified the major volatiles of 39 strains of skin commensals (Staphylococci and Corynebacterium). Importantly, to validate the behavioral activity of these volatiles, we first assessed landing behavior triggered by human skin bacteria volatiles. We demonstrated that this behavioral step is gated by the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid, similar to the combinatorial coding triggering short range attraction. Repellency behavior to selected skin volatiles and terpenes was tested in the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid. In a 2-choice landing behavior context, the skin volatiles 2- and 3-methyl butyric acids reduced mosquito landing by 62.0-81.6% and 87.1-99.6%, respectively. Similarly, the terpene geraniol was capable of reducing mosquito landing behavior by 74.9%. We also tested the potential repellency effects of terpenes on mosquitoes at short-range using a 4-port olfactometer. In these assays, geraniol reduced mosquito attraction (69-78%) to a mixture of key human kairomones carbon dioxide, L-(+)-lactic acid, and ammonia. These findings demonstrate that carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid changes the valence of other skin volatiles towards mosquito landing behavior. Moreover, this study offers candidate odorants to be targeted in a novel strategy to reduce attractants or produce repellents by the human skin microbiota that may curtail mosquito bites, and subsequent mosquito-borne disease.\nAedes aegypti CCEae3A carboxylase expression confers carbamate, organophosphate and limited pyrethroid resistance in a model transgenic mosquito\nAuthors: Poulton, B. C.; Colman, F.; Anthousi, A.; Sattelle, D. B.; Lycett, G. J.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553486\nInsecticide resistance is a serious threat to our ability to control mosquito vectors which transmit pathogens including malaria parasites and arboviruses. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is an essential first step in tackling the challenges presented by resistance. This study aimed to functionally characterise the carboxylesterase, CCEae3A, the elevated expression of which has been implicated in temephos resistance in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae. Using our GAL4/UAS expression system, already established in insecticide-sensitive Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, we produced transgenic An. gambiae mosquitoes that express an Ae. aegypti CCEae3A ubiquitously. This new transgenic line permits examination of CCEae3A expression in a background which does not express the gene and allows comparison with existing An. gambiae GAL4-UAS lines. Insecticide resistance profiling of these transgenic An. gambiae larvae indicated significant increases in resistance ratio for three organophosphate insecticides, temephos (5.98), chloropyriphos (6.64) and fenthion (3.18) when compared to the parental strain. Cross resistance to adulticides from three major insecticide classes: organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos methyl), carbamates (bendiocarb and propoxur) and pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) was also detected. Resistance to certain organophosphates and carbamates validates conclusions drawn from previous expression and phenotypic data. However, detection of resistance to pirimiphos methyl and alphacypermethrin has not previously been formally associated with CCEae3A, despite occurring in Ae. aegypti strains where this gene was upregulated. Our findings highlight the importance of characterising individual resistance mechanisms, thereby ensuring accurate information is used to guide future vector control strategies. Author SummaryInsecticides are vital disease control tools against pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes. However, they are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. Among the molecular changes that contribute to resistance, increased production of enzymes that break down/sequester the insecticide is common. In Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which spread many arboviruses, over-expression of the carboxylesterase enzyme, CEae3A, has been associated with resistance to certain insecticides used for vector control, particularly organophosphate compounds. However, multiple resistance enzymes/mechanisms are likely to be present in resistant mosquitoes at the same time. To examine the effect of CCEae3A expression in isolation, we utilised the An. gambiae mosquito with its convenient access to GAL4/UAS technology to regulate gene expression. This enabled production of CCEae3A in a normally insecticide-sensitive mosquito strain, permitting expression without interference from other resistance mechanisms. As anticipated, resistance to organophosphates was observed in larvae expressing CCEae3A. In adults, resistance was also found against compounds from organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticide classes, including two compounds for which there had been no previous association. As well directly linking CCEae3A expression to specific insecticide resistance, this transgenic line can be included in a panel expressing alternative enzymes to screen new insecticidal compounds for liability to existing resistance mechanisms.\nPlasticity of circadian and circatidal rhythms in activity and transcriptomic dynamics in a freshwater snail\nAuthors: Yokomizo, T.; Takahashi, Y.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553957\nOrganisms have diverse biological clocks synchronized with environmental cycles depending on their habitats. Anticipation of tidal changes has driven the evolution of circatidal rhythms in some marine species. In a freshwater snail, Semisulcospira reiniana, individuals in nontidal areas exhibit circadian rhythms, whereas those in tidal areas exhibit both circadian and circatidal rhythms. We investigated whether the circatidal rhythms are genetically determined or induced by environmental cycles. After exposure to a simulated tidal cycle, both tidal and nontidal populations exhibited circatidal rhythms in locomotive activity. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes with circatidal oscillation increased due to entrainment to the tidal cycle in both populations and dominant rhythmicity was consistent with the environmental cycle. These results suggest plasticity in the endogenous rhythm in both populations. However, circatidal oscillating genes were more abundant in the tidal population than in the nontidal population, suggesting that a greater number of genes are associated with circatidal clocks in the tidal population compared to the nontidal population. Our findings suggest that the plasticity of biological rhythms and genetic changes in the molecular network between clocks and downstream genes may have contributed to the adaptation to the tidal environment in S. reiniana.\nHoney bee Apis mellifera L. Responses to Oxidative Stress Induced by Pharmacological and Pesticide Compounds\nAuthors: Tahir, F.; Goblirsch, M.; Adamczyk, J.; Karim, S.; Alburaki, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553037\nThe western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a eusocial insect that plays major roles in ecosystem balances and pollination of plants and food crops. Honey bees face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pathogens, diseases, chemical pesticides, and climate change, which all contribute to honey bee colony loss. This study investigated the impacts of multiple pharmacological and pesticide molecules on honey bee survival and gene regulation responses. In an 11-day cage experiment, sublethal doses of tunicamycin, thapsigargin, metformin, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, and imidacloprid were administered to newly emerged sister bees. Daily treatment consumption and mortality were recorded, as well as the transcription expression of twelve major genes (AChE-2, Apisimin, Apidaecin, mrjp1, Sodq, cp450, SelT, SelK, Ire1, Xbp1, Derl-1, Hsc70), some of which are markers of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in honey bees. At day 9 of the treatments, protein damage was quantified in caged bees. Kaplan-Meier model indicated significant (p \u003c 0.001) toxicological effects of paraquat, H2O2 and tunicamycin on bee survivorship compared to controls with better survivals for other molecules. Post-ingestive aversion responses were recorded only in the case of tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and imidacloprid. Nonetheless, significantly higher protein damage on day 9 was only identified in bees exposed to paraquat and imidacloprid. Some antioxidant genes significantly regulated vis-a-vis specific treatments. Our results reveal age-related regulation of other major genes with significant inter-gene positive correlations.\nNew insights into the systematics of the Afrotropical Amblyomma marmoreum complex (Acari, Ixodidae) and a novel Rickettsia africae strain using morphological and metagenomic approaches\nAuthors: Cotes-Perdomo, A. P.; Sanchez-Vialas, A.; Thomas, R.; Jenkins, A.; Uribe, J. E.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553479\nThe Amblyomma marmoreum complex includes some Afrotropical species, such as Amblyomma sparsum, a three-host tick that parasitizes reptiles, birds, and mammals, and is a recognized vector of Ehrlichia ruminatum. However, the lack of morphological, genetic and ecological data on A. sparsum has caused considerable confusion in its identification among A. marmoreum complex members. In this study, we used microscopy and metagenomic approaches to analyze A. sparsum ticks collected from a puff adder snake (Bitis arietans) in southwest Senegal (an endemic rickettsioses area) in order to supplement previous morphological descriptions, provide novel genomic data for the A. marmoreum complex, and search for some associated spotted fever agent. Based on stereoscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphological evaluations, we provided high-quality images and new insights about punctation and enameling in the male of A. sparsum to facilitate identification for future studies. Additionally, the metagenomic approach allowed us assembly the complete mitochondrial genome of A. sparsum, as well as the nearly entire chromosome and complete plasmid sequences of a novel Rickettsia africae strain. Phylogenomic analyses showed a close relationship between A. sparsum and A. nuttalli for the first time and confirmed the position of A. sparsum within the A. marmoreum complex. Our results provide new insights into the systematic of A. sparsum and A. marmoreum complex, as well as the genetic diversity of R. africae in Afrotropical region. Future studies should consider the possibility that A. sparsum may be a competent vector for R. africae.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Insecticide resistance is a serious threat to our ability to control mosquito vectors which transmit pathogens including malaria parasites and arboviruses. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is an essential first step in tackling the challenges presented by resistance. This study aimed to functionally characterise the carboxylesterase, CCEae3A, the elevated expression of which has been implicated in temephos resistance in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus larvae. Using our GAL4/UAS expression system, already established in insecticide-sensitive Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, we produced transgenic An. gambiae mosquitoes that express an Ae. aegypti CCEae3A ubiquitously. This new transgenic line permits examination of CCEae3A expression in a background which does not express the gene and allows comparison with existing An. gambiae GAL4-UAS lines. Insecticide resistance profiling of these transgenic An. gambiae larvae indicated significant increases in resistance ratio for three organophosphate insecticides, temephos (5.98), chloropyriphos (6.64) and fenthion (3.18) when compared to the parental strain. Cross resistance to adulticides from three major insecticide classes: organophosphates (malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos methyl), carbamates (bendiocarb and propoxur) and pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin) was also detected. Resistance to certain organophosphates and carbamates validates conclusions drawn from previous expression and phenotypic data. However, detection of resistance to pirimiphos methyl and alphacypermethrin has not previously been formally associated with CCEae3A, despite occurring in Ae. aegypti strains where this gene was upregulated. Our findings highlight the importance of characterising individual resistance mechanisms, thereby ensuring accurate information is used to guide future vector control strategies.

Author SummaryInsecticides are vital disease control tools against pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes. However, they are becoming less effective as mosquitoes develop resistance. Among the molecular changes that contribute to resistance, increased production of enzymes that break down/sequester the insecticide is common. In Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, which spread many arboviruses, over-expression of the carboxylesterase enzyme, CEae3A, has been associated with resistance to certain insecticides used for vector control, particularly organophosphate compounds. However, multiple resistance enzymes/mechanisms are likely to be present in resistant mosquitoes at the same time. To examine the effect of CCEae3A expression in isolation, we utilised the An. gambiae mosquito with its convenient access to GAL4/UAS technology to regulate gene expression. This enabled production of CCEae3A in a normally insecticide-sensitive mosquito strain, permitting expression without interference from other resistance mechanisms. As anticipated, resistance to organophosphates was observed in larvae expressing CCEae3A. In adults, resistance was also found against compounds from organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticide classes, including two compounds for which there had been no previous association. As well directly linking CCEae3A expression to specific insecticide resistance, this transgenic line can be included in a panel expressing alternative enzymes to screen new insecticidal compounds for liability to existing resistance mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms have diverse biological clocks synchronized with environmental cycles depending on their habitats. Anticipation of tidal changes has driven the evolution of circatidal rhythms in some marine species. In a freshwater snail, Semisulcospira reiniana, individuals in nontidal areas exhibit circadian rhythms, whereas those in tidal areas exhibit both circadian and circatidal rhythms. We investigated whether the circatidal rhythms are genetically determined or induced by environmental cycles. After exposure to a simulated tidal cycle, both tidal and nontidal populations exhibited circatidal rhythms in locomotive activity. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes with circatidal oscillation increased due to entrainment to the tidal cycle in both populations and dominant rhythmicity was consistent with the environmental cycle. These results suggest plasticity in the endogenous rhythm in both populations. However, circatidal oscillating genes were more abundant in the tidal population than in the nontidal population, suggesting that a greater number of genes are associated with circatidal clocks in the tidal population compared to the nontidal population. Our findings suggest that the plasticity of biological rhythms and genetic changes in the molecular network between clocks and downstream genes may have contributed to the adaptation to the tidal environment in S. reiniana.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The western honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a eusocial insect that plays major roles in ecosystem balances and pollination of plants and food crops. Honey bees face multiple biotic and abiotic stressors, such as pathogens, diseases, chemical pesticides, and climate change, which all contribute to honey bee colony loss. This study investigated the impacts of multiple pharmacological and pesticide molecules on honey bee survival and gene regulation responses. In an 11-day cage experiment, sublethal doses of tunicamycin, thapsigargin, metformin, paraquat, hydrogen peroxide, and imidacloprid were administered to newly emerged sister bees. Daily treatment consumption and mortality were recorded, as well as the transcription expression of twelve major genes (AChE-2, Apisimin, Apidaecin, mrjp1, Sodq, cp450, SelT, SelK, Ire1, Xbp1, Derl-1, Hsc70), some of which are markers of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in honey bees. At day 9 of the treatments, protein damage was quantified in caged bees. Kaplan-Meier model indicated significant (p &lt; 0.001) toxicological effects of paraquat, H2O2 and tunicamycin on bee survivorship compared to controls with better survivals for other molecules. Post-ingestive aversion responses were recorded only in the case of tunicamycin, hydrogen peroxide and imidacloprid. Nonetheless, significantly higher protein damage on day 9 was only identified in bees exposed to paraquat and imidacloprid. Some antioxidant genes significantly regulated vis-a-vis specific treatments. Our results reveal age-related regulation of other major genes with significant inter-gene positive correlations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Amblyomma marmoreum complex includes some Afrotropical species, such as Amblyomma sparsum, a three-host tick that parasitizes reptiles, birds, and mammals, and is a recognized vector of Ehrlichia ruminatum. However, the lack of morphological, genetic and ecological data on A. sparsum has caused considerable confusion in its identification among A. marmoreum complex members. In this study, we used microscopy and metagenomic approaches to analyze A. sparsum ticks collected from a puff adder snake (Bitis arietans) in southwest Senegal (an endemic rickettsioses area) in order to supplement previous morphological descriptions, provide novel genomic data for the A. marmoreum complex, and search for some associated spotted fever agent. Based on stereoscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphological evaluations, we provided high-quality images and new insights about punctation and enameling in the male of A. sparsum to facilitate identification for future studies. Additionally, the metagenomic approach allowed us assembly the complete mitochondrial genome of A. sparsum, as well as the nearly entire chromosome and complete plasmid sequences of a novel Rickettsia africae strain. Phylogenomic analyses showed a close relationship between A. sparsum and A. nuttalli for the first time and confirmed the position of A. sparsum within the A. marmoreum complex. Our results provide new insights into the systematic of A. sparsum and A. marmoreum complex, as well as the genetic diversity of R. africae in Afrotropical region. Future studies should consider the possibility that A. sparsum may be a competent vector for R. africae.</p>
