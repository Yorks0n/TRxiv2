Each museum is built around one or more biological collections that serve as a repository of important materials for study, which have contributed to scientific research in increasingly important areas ranging from understanding global climate change to developing new biotechnological applications. However, despite centuries of existence, global collections sizes have only been recently estimated, and aside from analyses of certain institutions or well-studied clades, little is known about how patterns of collecting activity across institutions, geographic regions, or taxonomic clades, or how these patterns vary across time. To address this important gap in our understanding of critical life sciences infrastructure, I gathered and analyzed zoological records associated with preserved specimens collected between 1900 and 2015 and housed in worldwide natural history collections using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. My analysis indicated that global, museum-associated collecting activity focused on animals has varied greatly over time, peaking around 2000 and declining significantly since. By stratifying data by institution, nation, and taxonomic phylum and class, I also illuminated how individual data series contribute to these global patterns. Institutions and nations had either concentrated or dispersed periods of relatively high collecting activity that occurred over different time periods, although most growth occurred in the second half of the 20th century for both many individual institutions and globally. Certain taxonomic clades comprise the largest proportions of collections records over this time period, namely arthropods (especially insects) and chordates (especially vertebrates), underscoring the taxonomically biased collecting histories of many institutions. Altogether, my analyses provide a critical, early view of historical zoological collecting activity and, to help other museum stakeholders to explore the data and results in more depth, I also describe and release NHMinformatics, an interactive dashboard built using R Shiny. These resources, when combined with recommendations I have made for sustainable collections growth, will be helpful for establishing policy goals, provisioning museum infrastructure, and training curatorial personnel.\nAssociation between movement patterns, microbiome diversity, and potential pathogen presence in free-ranging feral pigeons foraging in dairy farms.\nAuthors: Crafton, M.; Spiegel, O.; Cahani, S.; Lublin, A.; Rauer, L.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561861\nThe feedback between host behavior and disease transmission is well acknowledged, but empirical studies demonstrating associations between individual's pathogens or microbiota composition and their movement are rare. We investigated these associations in feral pigeons (Columba livia domestica), a synanthrope species known to host a plethora of zoonotic pathogens. We captured pigeons in three dairy farms along an urbanization gradient in central Israel. We combined GPS-tracking with Next Generation Sequencing to characterize pigeons' movement and microbiota, respectively. We found that pigeons roosted primarily in human settlements, with frequent visits to dairy farms and other agricultural sites. Microbiota diversity and composition varied between sites and the individuals within them, and several pathogens relevant to poultry, cattle, and human-health were frequently detected. Pigeons in the urban site covered shorter distances and carried a greater diversity of bacteria compared to those in rural sites. Intriguingly, beyond these among-site differences, exploratory individuals (measured by the number of unique locations they visited) had more diverse microbiota. We conclude that pigeons can potentially serve as transmission vectors among wildlife, livestock, and humans. Further, the associations between host behavior and microbiota diversity emphasize the relevance of wildlife movement analyses for disease ecology and One Health.\n",
