R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 58.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzel's (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\nSex change every year: A unique reproductive strategy of the stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia (Euphyllia) ancor\nAuthors: Shikina, S.; Tsai, P.-H.; Chiu, Y.-L.; Chang, C.-F.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573442\nThe present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.\nEntomological surveys and insecticide susceptibility profile of Aedes aegypti during the dengue outbreak in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022\nAuthors: Kamgang, B.; Acantara, J.; Tedjou, A.; Keumeni, C.; Yougang, A.; Ancia, A.; Bigirimana, F.; Clarke, S.; Gil, V. S.; Wondji, C.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574582\nBackgroundThe first dengue outbreak was reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022. This study was undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. Methodology/Principal FindingsEntomological surveys were performed in all the seven health districts of Sao tome and Principe during the dry and rainy seasons in 2022. WHO tube and synergist assays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were carried out and the genotyping of F1534C/V1016I/V410L mutations in Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers. In both survey periods, the Breteau (BI \u003e 50), house (HI \u003e 35%) and container (CI \u003e 20%) indices were higher than threshold established by WHO to indicate high potential risk of dengue transmission. Aedes aegypti sample was susceptible to all insecticides tested except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (9.2% mortality), bendiocarb (61.4% mortality) and alpha-cypermethrin (97% mortality). A full recovery was reported in Ae. aegypti resistant to bendiocarb after pre-exposure to synergist PBO. Only one Ae. aegypti specimen was found carrying F1534C mutation. Conclusions/SignificanceThese findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year, with the bulk of larval breeding occurring in used tyres, water storage and discarded containers. Most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except DDT and bendiocarb. These data underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion. Author SummaryDuring the first dengue outbreak reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022, entomological investigations were undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. The results revealed the presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers suggesting a good waste management and improving water supply system could help to reduce Aedes densities and the risk of dengue transmission. Analyses also revealed that most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and bendiocarb. These findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year and underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.\nThe value of livestock abortion surveillance in Tanzania: identifying disease priorities and informing interventions\nAuthors: Lankester, F.; Kibona, T. J.; Allan, K. J.; de Glanville, W.; Buza, J. J.; Katzer, F.; Halliday, J. E.; Mmbaga, B. T.; Wheelhouse, N.; Innes, E. A.; Thomas, K.; Nyasebwa, O. M.; Swai, E.; Claxton, J. R.; Cleaveland, S.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574517\nBackgroundLack of reliable data on the aetiology of livestock diseases, especially in Africa, is a major factor constraining the design of effective livestock health interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. RationaleLivestock abortion is an important disease syndrome that affects productivity and livestock economies, and poses risks to public health. Worldwide, several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa livestock disease surveillance data rarely include information from abortion events, little is known about the aetiology and impacts of livestock abortions, and data are not available to inform prioritisation of disease interventions. MethodsThis paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform that was set up in 15 wards in northern Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder agro-ecological systems to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion cases were reported by farmers to Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries livestock field officers and on to investigation teams. The abortion was eligible for inclusion if the research field team or livestock field officer could attend within 72 hours of the event occurring. If so, a field investigation was carried out to collect diagnostic samples from aborted materials and aborting dams and questionnaire data on herd/flock management. Laboratory diagnostic tests were carried out for a range of abortigenic pathogens, and laboratory and questionnaire data analysed to investigate a) determinants of attribution; b) patterns of investigated events, including species and breed affected, history of previous abortion and recent stressful events, and the seasonality of cases; c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases in which zoonotic pathogens were detection. ResultsOver a two-year period (2017-2019), 215 abortion events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44) and goats (n=100) were investigated from 13 of the 15 wards. The number of investigated cases varied widely across wards, with three of the 15 field officers (20%) reporting 70% of investigated cases. Aetiological attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases through PCR-based diagnostics, was significantly affected by delays in field investigation. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR diagnostics due to rapid deterioration of field samples. Vaginal swabs from aborting dams provided a practical and sensitive source of diagnostic material for pathogen detection. Discussion / ConclusionLivestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale and when capturing only a small proportion of events, can generate valuable information on causes of zoonotic disease outbreaks, livestock reproductive losses and can identify important pathogens that are not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an effective reporting and investigation system that could be implemented across a range of settings, including remote rural areas, with engagement of community-based field officers, and establishment of practical sample collection protocols and molecular diagnostic platforms all being important elements of effectiveness.\nEffect of habitat degradation on hantavirus infection among introduced and endemic small mammals of Madagascar\nAuthors: Dubrulle, J. A.; Kauffman, K.; Soarimalala, V.; Randriamoria, T.; Goodman, S. M.; Herrera, J.; Nunn, C. L.; Tortosa, P.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573235\nHantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.\nWild bird mass mortalities in eastern Canada associated with the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus, 2022\nAuthors: Avery-Gomm, S.; Barychka, T.; English, M.; Ronconi, R.; Wilhelm, S. I.; Rail, J.-F.; Cormier, T.; Beaumont, M.; Bowser, C.; Burt, T. V.; Collins, S.; Duffy, S.; Giacinti, J. A.; Gilliland, S.; Giroux, J.-F.; Gjerdrum, C.; Guillemette, M.; Hargan, K. E.; Jones, M.; Kennedy, A.; Kusalik, L.; Lair, S.; Lang, A. S.; Lavoie, R. A.; Lepage, C.; McPhail, G.; Montevecchi, W. A.; Parsons, G. J.; Provencher, J. F.; Rahman, I.; Robertson, G. J.; Seyer, Y.; Soos, C.; Ward, C. R. E.; Wells, R.; Wight, J.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574233\nIn 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with &#34;macaque- or baboon-like cognition&#34; whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzel&#39;s (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe first dengue outbreak was reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022. This study was undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEntomological surveys were performed in all the seven health districts of Sao tome and Principe during the dry and rainy seasons in 2022. WHO tube and synergist assays using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and diethyl maleate (DEM) were carried out and the genotyping of F1534C/V1016I/V410L mutations in Ae. aegypti. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus were found in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers. In both survey periods, the Breteau (BI &gt; 50), house (HI &gt; 35%) and container (CI &gt; 20%) indices were higher than threshold established by WHO to indicate high potential risk of dengue transmission. Aedes aegypti sample was susceptible to all insecticides tested except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (9.2% mortality), bendiocarb (61.4% mortality) and alpha-cypermethrin (97% mortality). A full recovery was reported in Ae. aegypti resistant to bendiocarb after pre-exposure to synergist PBO. Only one Ae. aegypti specimen was found carrying F1534C mutation.

Conclusions/SignificanceThese findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year, with the bulk of larval breeding occurring in used tyres, water storage and discarded containers. Most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except DDT and bendiocarb. These data underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.

Author SummaryDuring the first dengue outbreak reported in Sao Tome and Principe in 2022, entomological investigations were undertaken aiming to establish the typology of Aedes larval habitats, the distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, the related entomological risk and the susceptibility profile of Ae. aegypti to insecticides for a better evidence-informed response. The results revealed the presence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in all seven health districts of the country with high prevalence of Ae. aegypti in the most urbanised district, Agua Grande. Both Aedes species bred mainly in used tyres, discarded tanks and water storage containers suggesting a good waste management and improving water supply system could help to reduce Aedes densities and the risk of dengue transmission. Analyses also revealed that most of the insecticides tested remain effective to control Aedes vectors in Sao Tome except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and bendiocarb. These findings revealed at high potential risk for dengue transmission throughout the year and underline the importance to raise community awareness and to implement routine dengue vector control strategies to prevent further outbreaks in Sao Tome and Principe, and elsewhere in the subregion.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLack of reliable data on the aetiology of livestock diseases, especially in Africa, is a major factor constraining the design of effective livestock health interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health.

RationaleLivestock abortion is an important disease syndrome that affects productivity and livestock economies, and poses risks to public health. Worldwide, several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa livestock disease surveillance data rarely include information from abortion events, little is known about the aetiology and impacts of livestock abortions, and data are not available to inform prioritisation of disease interventions.

MethodsThis paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform that was set up in 15 wards in northern Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder agro-ecological systems to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion cases were reported by farmers to Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries livestock field officers and on to investigation teams. The abortion was eligible for inclusion if the research field team or livestock field officer could attend within 72 hours of the event occurring. If so, a field investigation was carried out to collect diagnostic samples from aborted materials and aborting dams and questionnaire data on herd/flock management. Laboratory diagnostic tests were carried out for a range of abortigenic pathogens, and laboratory and questionnaire data analysed to investigate a) determinants of attribution; b) patterns of investigated events, including species and breed affected, history of previous abortion and recent stressful events, and the seasonality of cases; c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases in which zoonotic pathogens were detection.

ResultsOver a two-year period (2017-2019), 215 abortion events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44) and goats (n=100) were investigated from 13 of the 15 wards. The number of investigated cases varied widely across wards, with three of the 15 field officers (20%) reporting 70% of investigated cases. Aetiological attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases through PCR-based diagnostics, was significantly affected by delays in field investigation. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR diagnostics due to rapid deterioration of field samples. Vaginal swabs from aborting dams provided a practical and sensitive source of diagnostic material for pathogen detection.

Discussion / ConclusionLivestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale and when capturing only a small proportion of events, can generate valuable information on causes of zoonotic disease outbreaks, livestock reproductive losses and can identify important pathogens that are not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an effective reporting and investigation system that could be implemented across a range of settings, including remote rural areas, with engagement of community-based field officers, and establishment of practical sample collection protocols and molecular diagnostic platforms all being important elements of effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In 2022, a severe outbreak of clade 2.3.4.4b Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus resulted in unprecedented mortality among wild birds in eastern Canada. Tens of thousands of birds were reported sick or dead, prompting a comprehensive assessment of mortality spanning the breeding season between April 1 and September 30, 2022. Mortality reports were collated from federal, Indigenous, provincial, and municipal agencies, the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, non-governmental organizations, universities, and citizen science platforms. A scenario analysis was conducted to refine mortality estimates, accounting for potential double counts from multiple sources under a range of spatial and temporal overlap. Correcting for double counting, an estimated 40,966 wild birds were reported sick or dead in eastern Canada during the spring and summer of 2022. Seabirds and sea ducks, long-lived species that are slow to recover from perturbations, accounted for 98.7% of reported mortalities. Mortalities were greatest among Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus; 26,193), Common Murres (Uria aalge; 8,133), and American Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri; 1,945), however, these figures underestimate total mortality as they exclude unreported deaths on land and at sea. In addition to presenting mortality estimates, we compare mortalities with known population sizes and trends and make an initial assessment of whether population-level impacts are possible for the Northern Gannet, a species that has suffered significant global mortality, and two harvested species, Common Murre and American Common Eider, to support management decisions. We hypothesize that population-level impacts in eastern Canada are possible for Northern Gannets and American Common Eiders but are unlikely for Common Murres. This study underscores the urgent need for further research to understand the broader ecological ramifications of the HPAI outbreak on wild bird populations.</p>
