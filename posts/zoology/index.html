Testing claims of exceptional cognition in dinosaurs and the application of neuron count estimates in palaeontological research\nAuthors: Caspar, K. R.; Gutierrez-Ibanez, C.; Bertrand, O. C.; Carr, T.; Colbourne, J.; Erb, A.; George, H.; Holtz, T. R.; Naish, D.; Wylie, D. R.; Hurlburt, G. R.\nScore: 62.6, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575006\nRecent years have seen increasing scientific interest in whether neuron counts can act as correlates of diverse biological phenomena. Lately, Herculano-Houzel (2022) argued that fossil endocasts and comparative neurological data from extant sauropsids allow to reconstruct telencephalic neuron counts in Mesozoic dinosaurs and pterosaurs, which might act as proxies for behavior and life history traits in these animals. According to this analysis, large theropods such as Tyrannosaurus rex were long-lived, exceptionally intelligent animals with \"macaque- or baboon-like cognition\" whereas sauropods as well as many ornithischian dinosaurs displayed an ectothermic physiology. Besides challenging established views on Mesozoic dinosaur biology, these claims raise questions on whether neuron count estimates could benefit research on fossil animals in general. Here, we address these findings by revisiting Herculano-Houzels (2022) neurological estimates and arguments. We present revised estimates of encephalization and telencephalic neuron counts in dinosaurs, which we derive from phylogenetically informed modeling and an amended dataset of endocranial measurements. For large-bodied theropods in particular, we recover significantly lower neuron counts than previously proposed. Furthermore, we review the suitability of neurological variables such as neuron count estimates and relative brain size to predict cognitive complexity, metabolic rate and life history traits in dinosaurs, coming to the conclusion that they are flawed proxies of these biological phenomena. Instead of relying on such neurological estimates when reconstructing Mesozoic dinosaur biology, we argue that integrative approaches are needed to approach this complex subject.\nMuscle-controlled physics simulations of the emu (a large running bird) resolve the grounded running paradox\nAuthors: van Bijlert, P. A.; van Soest, A. J. K.; Schulp, A. S.; Bates, K. T.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575928\nHumans and birds utilize very different running styles. Unlike humans, birds adopt \"grounded running\" at intermediate speeds - a running gait where at least one foot is always in contact with the ground. Avian grounded running is paradoxical: animals tend to minimize locomotor energy expenditure, but birds prefer grounded running despite incurring higher energy costs. Using predictive gait simulations of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), we resolve this paradox by demonstrating that grounded running represents an energetic optimum for birds. Our virtual experiments decoupled biomechanically relevant anatomical features that cannot be isolated in a real bird. The avian body plan prevents (near) vertical leg postures while running, making the running style used by humans impossible. Under this anatomical constraint, grounded running is optimal if the muscles produce the highest forces in crouched postures, as is true in most birds. Anatomical similarities between birds and non-avian dinosaurs suggest that, as a behavior, avian grounded running first evolved within non-avian theropods.\nThermal Tolerance Plasticity and Dynamics of Thermal Tolerance in Eublepharis macularius: Implications for Future Climate-Driven Heat Stress\nAuthors: White, E.; Kim, S.; Wegh, G.; Chiari, Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575519\nThe intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 hours from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass. Our findings contribute to the increasing body of work focused on understanding the influence of biological and environmental factors on thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms and provide phenotypic data to further investigate the molecular basis of thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms.\nGeographic, ecological, and temporal patterns of seabird mortality during the 2022 HPAI H5N1 outbreak on the island of Newfoundland\nAuthors: McPhail, G. M.; Collins, S. M.; Burt, T. V.; Careen, N. G.; Doiron, P. B.; Avery-Gomm, S.; Barychka, T.; English, M.; Giacinti, J. A.; Jones, M. E. B.; Provencher, J. F.; Soos, C.; Ward, C. R. E.; Duffy, S.; Wilhelm, S. I.; Wight, J.; Rahman, I.; Hargan, K. E.; Lang, A. S.; Montevecchi, W. A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-18 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575746\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 caused mass seabird mortality across the North Atlantic in 2022. Following outbreaks in Europe, the first case in North America was detected on the island of Newfoundland (NFLD), Canada in November 2021, before spreading through all North American flyways. During the following breeding season, NFLD experienced the second-highest number of seabird mortalities in Canadian provinces. Surveys and citizen reports identified 13543 seabird mortalities from April to September 2022. Many carcasses occurred on the west coast of NFLD in May and June 2022. Reported mortalities peaked in July along the southeastern coast. In August and September, mortalities were concentrated along the northeastern coast. With the exception of two colony surveys, reported mortalities decreased in September. Most mortality was found among Northern Gannet (6622), Common Murre (5992), Atlantic Puffin (282), and Black-legged Kittiwake (217). Using comprehensive knowledge of seabird ecology, we formulated exploratory hypotheses regarding traits that could contribute to mortality. Species differences in mortality were most strongly associated with nesting density, timing of breeding, and at-sea overlap with allospecifics from other colonies. Unprecedented seabird mortality and ongoing transmission within the circulating avian influenza viruses highlight the need for continued monitoring and development of conservation strategies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Humans and birds utilize very different running styles. Unlike humans, birds adopt &#34;grounded running&#34; at intermediate speeds - a running gait where at least one foot is always in contact with the ground. Avian grounded running is paradoxical: animals tend to minimize locomotor energy expenditure, but birds prefer grounded running despite incurring higher energy costs. Using predictive gait simulations of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), we resolve this paradox by demonstrating that grounded running represents an energetic optimum for birds. Our virtual experiments decoupled biomechanically relevant anatomical features that cannot be isolated in a real bird. The avian body plan prevents (near) vertical leg postures while running, making the running style used by humans impossible. Under this anatomical constraint, grounded running is optimal if the muscles produce the highest forces in crouched postures, as is true in most birds. Anatomical similarities between birds and non-avian dinosaurs suggest that, as a behavior, avian grounded running first evolved within non-avian theropods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The intensity and duration of heat waves, as well as average global temperatures, are expected to increase due to climate change. Heat waves can cause physiological stress and reduce fitness in animals. Species can reduce overheating risk through phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to raise their thermal tolerance limits over time. This mechanism could be important for ectotherms whose body temperatures are directly influenced by available environmental temperatures. Geckos are a large, diverse group of ectotherms that vary in their thermal habitats and times of daily activity, which could affect how they physiologically adjust to heat waves. Data on thermal physiology are scarce for reptiles, with only one study in geckos. Understanding thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their relationship, is essential for understanding how some species are able to adjust or adapt to changing temperatures. In this study, we estimated thermal tolerance and plasticity, and their interaction, in the crepuscular gecko, Eublepharis macularius, a species that is emerging as a model for reptile biology. After estimating basal thermal tolerance for 28 geckos, thermal tolerance was measured for each individual a second time at several timepoints (3, 6, or 24 h) to determine thermal tolerance plasticity. We found that thermal tolerance plasticity (1) does not depend on the basal thermal tolerance of the organism, (2) was highest after 6 hours from initial heat shock, and (3) was negatively influenced by individual body mass. Our findings contribute to the increasing body of work focused on understanding the influence of biological and environmental factors on thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms and provide phenotypic data to further investigate the molecular basis of thermal tolerance plasticity in organisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 caused mass seabird mortality across the North Atlantic in 2022. Following outbreaks in Europe, the first case in North America was detected on the island of Newfoundland (NFLD), Canada in November 2021, before spreading through all North American flyways. During the following breeding season, NFLD experienced the second-highest number of seabird mortalities in Canadian provinces. Surveys and citizen reports identified 13543 seabird mortalities from April to September 2022. Many carcasses occurred on the west coast of NFLD in May and June 2022. Reported mortalities peaked in July along the southeastern coast. In August and September, mortalities were concentrated along the northeastern coast. With the exception of two colony surveys, reported mortalities decreased in September. Most mortality was found among Northern Gannet (6622), Common Murre (5992), Atlantic Puffin (282), and Black-legged Kittiwake (217). Using comprehensive knowledge of seabird ecology, we formulated exploratory hypotheses regarding traits that could contribute to mortality. Species differences in mortality were most strongly associated with nesting density, timing of breeding, and at-sea overlap with allospecifics from other colonies. Unprecedented seabird mortality and ongoing transmission within the circulating avian influenza viruses highlight the need for continued monitoring and development of conservation strategies.</p>
