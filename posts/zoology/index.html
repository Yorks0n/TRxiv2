The clouded mother-of-pearl Protogoniomorpha anacardii Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) was recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia. At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan.">

At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.\nSex change every year: A unique reproductive strategy of the stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia (Euphyllia) ancor\nAuthors: Shikina, S.; Tsai, P.-H.; Chiu, Y.-L.; Chang, C.-F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573442\nThe present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.\nImage-Based Recognition of Parasitoid Wasps Using Advanced Neural Networks\nAuthors: Shirali, H.; Hübner, J.; Both, R.; Raupach, M.; Schmidt, S.; Pylatiuk, C.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573817\nHymenoptera have some of the highest diversity and number of individuals among insects. Many of these species potentially play key roles as food sources, pest controllers, and pollinators. However, little is known about their diversity and biology, and about 80% of the species have not been described yet. Classical taxonomy based on morphology is a rather slow process, but DNA barcoding has already brought considerable progress in identification. Innovative methods such as image-based identification and automation can even further speed up the process. We present a proof of concept for image data recognition of a parasitic wasp family, the Diapriidae (Hymenoptera), obtained as part of the GBOL III project. These tiny (1.2 - 4.5 mm) wasps were photographed and identified using DNA barcoding to provide a solid ground truth for training a neural network. Subsequently, three different neural network architectures were trained, evaluated, and optimized. As a result, 11 different classes of diaprids and one class of \"other Hymenoptera '' can be classified with an average accuracy of 96%. Additionally, the sex of the specimen can be classified automatically with an accuracy of \u003e 96%.\n",
