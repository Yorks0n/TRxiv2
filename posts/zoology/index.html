A.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.565567\nThe sustainability of zoo populations is dependent on maintaining genetic diversity and controlling heritable disease. Here, we explore the integration of whole genome sequencing data in the management of the international zoological population of western lowland gorillas, focusing on genetic diversity and heritable diseases. By comparing kinship values derived from classical pedigree mapping and whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that genomic data provides a more sensitive measure of relatedness. Our analysis reveals a decrease in genetic diversity due to closed breeding, emphasizing the potential for genetic intervention to mitigate negative impact on population fitness. We identify contributing factors to the decreasing genetic diversity including breeding within a closed population, unknown kinship among potential mates, and disproportionate genetic contributions from individual founders. Additionally, we highlight idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (IMF), a common cardiovascular pathology observed in zoologically housed gorillas, and identify a novel genetic variant in the TNNI3K gene that appears to be associated with this condition. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating molecular data into ex-situ population management strategies, and advocate for the adoption of advanced genomic techniques to optimize the genetic health and diversity of zoologically housed western lowland gorillas.\nThe greening-causing agent alters the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of the Asian citrus psyllid to a putative sex pheromone\nAuthors: Volpe, H. X. L.; Carmo-Sousa, M.; Luvizotto, R. A. G.; de Freitas, R.; Esperanca, V.; Darolt, J. C.; Pegoraro, A. A. L.; Magalhaes, D. M.; Favaris, A. P.; Wulff, N. A.; Miranda, M. P.; Bento, J. M. S.; Leal, W. S.\nScore: 19.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566442\nThe Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, is a vector of the pathological bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which causes the most devastating disease to the citrus industry worldwide, known as greening or huanglongbing (HLB). Earlier field tests with an acetic acid-based lure in greening-free, Valencia citrus orange groves in California showed promising results. The same type of lures tested in Sao Paulo, Brazil, showed unsettling results. During the unsuccessful trials, we noticed a relatively large proportion of females in the field, ultimately leading us to test field-collected males and females for Wolbachia and CLas. The results showed high rates of Wolbachia and CLas infection in field populations. We then compared the olfactory responses of laboratory-raised, CLas-free, and CLas-infected males to acetic acid. As previously reported, CLas-uninfected males responded to acetic acid at 1 {micro}g. Surprisingly, CLas-infected males required 50x higher doses of the putative sex pheromone, thus explaining the failure to capture CLas-infected males in the field. CLas infection was also manifested in electrophysiological responses. Electroantennogram responses from CLas-infected ACP males were significantly higher than those obtained with uninfected males. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogen infection affecting a vectors response to a sex attractant.\nObesity status and its relative factors of captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in China based on body condition assessment\nAuthors: Tang, Y.; Jia, T.; Zhou, F.; Wang, L.; Zhang, L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568637\nObesity is a common health problem in captive wildlife. Since the obesity status of captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in China has not previously been investigated, we recorded seven relevant variables (sex, age, daily feed supply, proportion of high-calorie feed, outdoor enclosure area, outdoor time, and foot disorder) related to obesity in 204 captive Asian elephants through field investigation of 43 elephant-raising facilities. Assessment of obesity was based on visual body condition scoring for each individual. It revealed that obesity was prevalent for captive Asian elephants (especially elephants in zoos) in China. Over 70% of captive Asian elephants in China were overweight or in obesity to various degrees. Statistical analysis showed that for elephants in zoos, insufficient outdoor time might be the primary potential cause of obesity. We suggested facilities to extend the outdoor time and control the supply of high-calorie feed (e.g., fruits, vegetables, pellets, etc.) for captive elephants, thereby alleviating obesity through increased exercise and a suitable energy intake. Moreover, all facilities should implement positive reinforcement training to facilitate regular physical examinations, including foot health checks and blood sampling. This training would improve the ability to collect more precise information relating to elephant health, obesity, and the evaluation of animal welfare.\nTime-course of antipredator behavioral changes induced by the helminth Pomphorhynchus laevis in its intermediate host Gammarus pulex: the switch in manipulation according to parasite developmental stage differs between behaviors\nAuthors: Rigaud, T.; Balourdet, A.; Bauer, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.25.538244\nMany trophically transmitted parasites with complex life cycles manipulate their intermediate hosts antipredatory defenses in ways facilitating their transmission to final host by predation. Some parasites also protect the intermediate host from predation when noninfective during its ontogeny. The acanthocephalan Pomphorynchus laevis, a fish intestinal helminth, infecting freshwater gammarid amphipods as intermediate hosts, is using such a strategy of protection-then-exposure to predation by the definitive host. However, the whole time-course of this sequence of behavioral switch is not yet known, and only one antipredator behavior has been studied to date. Here we show that the protective part of this manipulation begins early during the parasite ontogeny, in accordance with theoretical predictions, suggesting that the advantages overpass the costs induced by this protective manipulation. We confirmed that the refuge use behavior is showing a switch in the few days following the stage mature for the definitive host (switching from overuse to underuse). However, such a switch was not observed for the gammarids activity rate, a behavior also known to make the host less conspicuous to predators when weak. While we predicted a low activity during early development stages, then a switch to high activity, we observed general decrease in activity during the parasite ontogeny. The possible causes for this discrepancy between behaviors are discussed. All these behavioral changes were observed mostly when animals were tested in water scented by potential predators (here brown trout), suggesting condition-dependent manipulation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a common health problem in captive wildlife. Since the obesity status of captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in China has not previously been investigated, we recorded seven relevant variables (sex, age, daily feed supply, proportion of high-calorie feed, outdoor enclosure area, outdoor time, and foot disorder) related to obesity in 204 captive Asian elephants through field investigation of 43 elephant-raising facilities. Assessment of obesity was based on visual body condition scoring for each individual. It revealed that obesity was prevalent for captive Asian elephants (especially elephants in zoos) in China. Over 70% of captive Asian elephants in China were overweight or in obesity to various degrees. Statistical analysis showed that for elephants in zoos, insufficient outdoor time might be the primary potential cause of obesity. We suggested facilities to extend the outdoor time and control the supply of high-calorie feed (e.g., fruits, vegetables, pellets, etc.) for captive elephants, thereby alleviating obesity through increased exercise and a suitable energy intake. Moreover, all facilities should implement positive reinforcement training to facilitate regular physical examinations, including foot health checks and blood sampling. This training would improve the ability to collect more precise information relating to elephant health, obesity, and the evaluation of animal welfare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many trophically transmitted parasites with complex life cycles manipulate their intermediate hosts antipredatory defenses in ways facilitating their transmission to final host by predation. Some parasites also protect the intermediate host from predation when noninfective during its ontogeny. The acanthocephalan Pomphorynchus laevis, a fish intestinal helminth, infecting freshwater gammarid amphipods as intermediate hosts, is using such a strategy of protection-then-exposure to predation by the definitive host. However, the whole time-course of this sequence of behavioral switch is not yet known, and only one antipredator behavior has been studied to date. Here we show that the protective part of this manipulation begins early during the parasite ontogeny, in accordance with theoretical predictions, suggesting that the advantages overpass the costs induced by this protective manipulation. We confirmed that the refuge use behavior is showing a switch in the few days following the stage mature for the definitive host (switching from overuse to underuse). However, such a switch was not observed for the gammarids activity rate, a behavior also known to make the host less conspicuous to predators when weak. While we predicted a low activity during early development stages, then a switch to high activity, we observed general decrease in activity during the parasite ontogeny. The possible causes for this discrepancy between behaviors are discussed. All these behavioral changes were observed mostly when animals were tested in water scented by potential predators (here brown trout), suggesting condition-dependent manipulation.</p>
