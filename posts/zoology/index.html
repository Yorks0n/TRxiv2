At this stage, we confirmed the presence of this species in the southernmost part of Saudi Arabia based on photographs taken in 2020-2023 from Fayfa and the adjacent mountains in Jazan. The photographs match the descriptions and remarks made by Dr Torben Larsen in multiple publications, which suggest that this taxon represents the widespread subspecies P. a. nebulosa Trimen, 1881. Here, we discuss the Saudi Arabian populations of P. a. nebulosa and its conservation in depth and encourage more research on butterflies in Saudi Arabia.\nSex change every year: A unique reproductive strategy of the stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia (Euphyllia) ancor\nAuthors: Shikina, S.; Tsai, P.-H.; Chiu, Y.-L.; Chang, C.-F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573442\nThe present study documents a unique reproductive strategy of the colonial stony coral, Fimbriaphyllia ancora, during observations spanning 8 years. Of 26 colonies monitored at Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, about 70% changed their sexes every year, i.e., colonies that were males two years ago became females last year, and changed back to males this year. Apparently, the remaining 30% were permanently male or female. Sex-change and non-sex-change colonies were growing in close proximity or even side-by-side, suggesting that this sex change phenomenon is not driven by environmental factors. No significant differences were found in colony size between sex-change and non-sex-change colonies, suggesting that the sex change strategy may be related to intrinsic factors, e.g., age or genetics. Histological analysis showed that female-to-male sex change occurs 4-5 months after spawning, whereas male-to-female sex change occurs 0-3 months after sperm release. We propose that this unique strategy may increase success of sexual reproduction of sessile, colonial corals.\nEndangered Przewalski's horse, Equus pzrewalskii, cloned from historically cryopreserved cells\nAuthors: Novak, B.

These stallions are clones of a male that lived from 1975-1998 that pedigree analyses identified as a genetically valuable male for present-day conservation breeding. This is the first time that multiple healthy clones have been produced for an endangered species.\nEffect of habitat degradation on hantavirus infection among introduced and endemic small mammals of Madagascar\nAuthors: Dubrulle, J. A.; Kauffman, K.; Soarimalala, V.; Randriamoria, T.; Goodman, S. M.; Herrera, J.; Nunn, C. L.; Tortosa, P.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.24.573235\nHantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Hantaviruses are globally distributed zoonotic pathogens capable of causing fatal disease in humans. Rodents and other small mammals are the typical reservoirs of hantaviruses, though the particular host varies regionally. Addressing the risk of hantavirus spillover from animal reservoirs to humans requires identifying the local mammal reservoirs and the predictors of infection in those animals, such as their population density and habitat characteristics. We screened native and non-native small mammals and bats in northeastern Madagascar for hantavirus infection to investigate the influence of habitat, including effects of human land use on viral prevalence. We trapped 227 bats and 1663 small mammals over 5 successive years in and around Marojejy National Park across a range of habitat types including villages, agricultural fields, regrowth areas, and secondary and semi-intact forests. Animals sampled included endemic tenrecs (Tenrecidae), rodents (Nesomyidae) and bats (6 families), along with non-native rodents (Muridae) and shrews (Soricidae). A hantavirus closely related to the previously described Anjozorobe virus infected 9.5% of Rattus rattus sampled. We did not detect hantaviruses in any other species. Habitat degradation had a complex impact on hantavirus prevalence in our study system: more intensive land use increase the abundance of R. rattus. The average body size of individuals varied between agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, which in turn affected infection prevalence. Smaller R.rattus had lower probability of infection and were captured more commonly in villages and forests. Thus, infection prevalence was highest in agricultural areas. These findings provide new insights to the gradients of hantavirus exposure risk for humans in areas undergoing rapid land use transformations associated with agricultural practices.</p>
