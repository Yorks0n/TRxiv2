However, the consistency of morph trait covariation patterns across species, time, and ecological contexts remains unclear. This trait covariation is especially relevant in the context of invasion biology and urban adaptation. Specifically, physiological and behavioral traits pertaining to energy maintenance are crucial to fitness, given their immediate ties to individual reproduction, growth, and population establishment. We investigated the physiological and behavioral traits of Podarcis muralis, a versatile color polymorphic species that thrives in urban environments (including invasive populations in Ohio, USA). We measured five physiological and behavioral traits (circulating corticosterone and triglycerides, hematocrit, body condition, and field body temperature) which compose an integrated multivariate phenotype. We then tested variation among stable color polymorphisms in the context of establishment in an urban environment. We found that the traits describing physiological status and strategy shifted across the active season in a morph-dependent manner-the white and yellow morphs exhibited clearly different multivariate physiological phenotypes, characterized primarily by differences in circulating corticosterone. This suggests that morphs have different strategies in physiological regulation, the flexibility of which is crucial to urban adaptation. The white-yellow morph exhibited an intermediate phenotype, suggesting an intermediary energy maintenance strategy. Orange morphs also exhibited distinct phenotypes, but the low prevalence of this morph in our study populations precludes clear interpretation. Our work provides insight into how differences among stable polymorphisms exist across axes of the phenotype and how this variation may aid in establishment within novel environments.

(Nematoda: Rhabditidae) and Pellioditis pellio (Schneider, 1866), earthworm associates from different subclades within Pellioditis (syn. Phasmarhabditis Andrassy, 1976)\nAuthors: Tandingan De Ley, I.; Kiontke, K.; Bert, W.; Sudhaus, W.; Fitch, D. H. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546148\nRecently, much attention has been focused on a group of rhabditid nematodes called Phasmarhabditis, a junior synonym of Pellioditis, as a promising source of biocontrol agents for invasive slugs. Pellioditis pelhami n. sp. was first isolated from earthworms near Pelham Bay Park in Bronx, New York, USA, in 1990, and has been found to be pathogenic to slugs as well as some earthworms. It has also been used in several comparative developmental studies. Here, we provide a description of this species, as well as a redescription of a similar earthworm-associated nematode, Pellioditis pellio Schneider, 1866, re-isolated from the type locality. Although P. pelhami n. sp. and P. pellio are morphologically similar, they are reproductively isolated. Molecular phylogenetic analysis places both species in a clade that includes all species previously described as Phasmarhabditis which are associated with gastropods. Phasmarhabditis Andrassy, 1976 is therefore a junior synonym of Pellioditis Dougherty, 1953. Also, Phasmarhabditis bohemica Nermut', P[u][z]a, Mekete \u0026 Mra[c]ek, 2017, described to be a facultative parasite of slugs, is found to be a junior synonym of Pellioditis pellio (Schneider, 1866), adding to evidence that P. pellio is associated with both slugs and earthworms. The earthworm-associated species P. pelhami n. sp. and P. pellio represent different subclades within Pellioditis, suggesting that Pellioditis species in general have a broader host range than just slugs. Because of this, caution is warranted in using these species as biological control agents until more is understood about their ecology.\nMale and female syringeal muscles exhibit superfast shortening velocities in Zebra finches\nAuthors: Gladman, N. W.; Elemans, C. P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-06-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545584\nVocalisations play a key role in the communication behaviour of many vertebrates. Vocal production requires extremely precise motor control, which is executed by superfast vocal muscles that can operate at cycle frequencies over 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz. The mechanical performance of these muscles has been quantified with isometric performance and the workloop technique, but due to methodological limitations we lack a key muscle property characterising muscle performance, the force-velocity (FV) relationship. Here we establish a method that allows quantification of the FV relationship in extremely fast muscles, and test if the maximal shortening velocity of zebra finch syringeal muscles is different between males and females. We show that syringeal muscles exhibit extremely high maximal shortening velocities of 46 L0 s-1, far exceeding most other vocal and skeletal muscles, and that isometric properties positively correlate with maximal shortening velocities. While male and female muscles differ in isometric speed measures, maximal shortening velocity surprisingly is not sex-dependent. We also show that cyclical methods to measure force-length properties used in classical laryngeal studies give the same result as conventional stepwise methodologies, suggesting either approach is appropriate. Next to force, instantaneous power also trades for speed, further highlighting these muscles are tuned to operate at high frequencies. We argue that the high thermal dependence of superfast vocal muscle performance may impact vocal behaviour. Summary statementZebra finch syringeal muscle exhibits superfast shortening of 46 L0 s-1. Shortening is not sex-specific but correlates with isometric performance - faster twitches and tetani are associated with faster shortening.\nSurface temperatures are influenced by handling stress independently of glucocorticoid levels in wild king penguins\nAuthors: Lewden, A.; Ward, C.; Noiret, A.; Avril, S.; Abolivier, L.; Gerard, C.; Hammer, T. L.; Raymond, E.; Robin, J.-P.; Viblanc, V. A.; Bize, P.; STIER, A.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-06-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.545254\nAssessing the physiological stress responses of wild animals opens a window for understanding how organisms cope with environmental challenges. Since stress response is associated with changes in body temperature, the use of body surface temperature through thermal imaging could help to measure acute and chronic stress responses non-invasively. We used thermal imaging, acute handling-stress protocol and an experimental manipulation of glucocorticoid hormone levels in breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), to assess: 1. the potential contribution of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating chronic and acute stress-induced changes in adult surface temperature, 2. the influence of HPA axis manipulation on parental investment through thermal imaging of eggs and brooded chicks, and 3. the impact of parental treatment on offspring thermals response to acute handling. Eye temperature (Teye) increased and beak temperature (Tbeak) decreased in response to handling stress in adults, but neither basal nor stress-induced surface temperatures were significantly affected by glucocorticoid implants. While egg temperature was not significantly influenced by parental treatment, we found a surprising pattern for chicks: chicks brooded by the (non-implanted) partner of glucocorticoid-implanted individuals exhibited higher surface temperature (both Teye and Tbeak) than those brooded by glucocorticoid-implanted or control parents. Chicks response to handling in terms of surface temperature was characterized by a drop in both Teye and Tbeak independently of parental treatment. We conclude that the HPA seems unlikely to play a major role in determining chronic or acute changes in surface temperature in king penguins. Changes in surface temperature may primarily be mediated by the Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary axis (SAM) in response to stressful situations. Our experiment did not reveal a direct impact of parental HPA manipulation on parental investment (egg or chick temperature), but a potential influence on the partners brooding behaviour (i.e. family-transmitted stress hypothesis). HighlightsO_LIExperimental increase in CORT does not affect king penguins surface temperature C_LIO_LIAcute handling stress increases eye but decreases beak surface temperature in adults C_LIO_LIAcute handling decreases both eye and beak surface temperatures in young chicks C_LIO_LIParental CORT treatment does not affect egg surface temperature during incubation C_LIO_LIChicks brooded by non-implanted partners of CORT parents are warmer C_LI\n",

Here, we provide a description of this species, as well as a redescription of a similar earthworm-associated nematode, Pellioditis pellio Schneider, 1866, re-isolated from the type locality. Although P. pelhami n. sp. and P. pellio are morphologically similar, they are reproductively isolated. Molecular phylogenetic analysis places both species in a clade that includes all species previously described as Phasmarhabditis which are associated with gastropods. Phasmarhabditis Andrassy, 1976 is therefore a junior synonym of Pellioditis Dougherty, 1953. Also, Phasmarhabditis bohemica Nermut&#39;, P[u][z]a, Mekete &amp; Mra[c]ek, 2017, described to be a facultative parasite of slugs, is found to be a junior synonym of Pellioditis pellio (Schneider, 1866), adding to evidence that P. pellio is associated with both slugs and earthworms. The earthworm-associated species P. pelhami n. sp. and P. pellio represent different subclades within Pellioditis, suggesting that Pellioditis species in general have a broader host range than just slugs. Because of this, caution is warranted in using these species as biological control agents until more is understood about their ecology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalisations play a key role in the communication behaviour of many vertebrates. Vocal production requires extremely precise motor control, which is executed by superfast vocal muscles that can operate at cycle frequencies over 100 Hz and up to 250 Hz. The mechanical performance of these muscles has been quantified with isometric performance and the workloop technique, but due to methodological limitations we lack a key muscle property characterising muscle performance, the force-velocity (FV) relationship. Here we establish a method that allows quantification of the FV relationship in extremely fast muscles, and test if the maximal shortening velocity of zebra finch syringeal muscles is different between males and females. We show that syringeal muscles exhibit extremely high maximal shortening velocities of 46 L0 s-1, far exceeding most other vocal and skeletal muscles, and that isometric properties positively correlate with maximal shortening velocities. While male and female muscles differ in isometric speed measures, maximal shortening velocity surprisingly is not sex-dependent. We also show that cyclical methods to measure force-length properties used in classical laryngeal studies give the same result as conventional stepwise methodologies, suggesting either approach is appropriate. Next to force, instantaneous power also trades for speed, further highlighting these muscles are tuned to operate at high frequencies. We argue that the high thermal dependence of superfast vocal muscle performance may impact vocal behaviour.

Summary statementZebra finch syringeal muscle exhibits superfast shortening of 46 L0 s-1. Shortening is not sex-specific but correlates with isometric performance - faster twitches and tetani are associated with faster shortening.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assessing the physiological stress responses of wild animals opens a window for understanding how organisms cope with environmental challenges. Since stress response is associated with changes in body temperature, the use of body surface temperature through thermal imaging could help to measure acute and chronic stress responses non-invasively. We used thermal imaging, acute handling-stress protocol and an experimental manipulation of glucocorticoid hormone levels in breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), to assess: 1. the potential contribution of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating chronic and acute stress-induced changes in adult surface temperature, 2. the influence of HPA axis manipulation on parental investment through thermal imaging of eggs and brooded chicks, and 3. the impact of parental treatment on offspring thermals response to acute handling.

Eye temperature (Teye) increased and beak temperature (Tbeak) decreased in response to handling stress in adults, but neither basal nor stress-induced surface temperatures were significantly affected by glucocorticoid implants. While egg temperature was not significantly influenced by parental treatment, we found a surprising pattern for chicks: chicks brooded by the (non-implanted) partner of glucocorticoid-implanted individuals exhibited higher surface temperature (both Teye and Tbeak) than those brooded by glucocorticoid-implanted or control parents. Chicks response to handling in terms of surface temperature was characterized by a drop in both Teye and Tbeak independently of parental treatment.

We conclude that the HPA seems unlikely to play a major role in determining chronic or acute changes in surface temperature in king penguins. Changes in surface temperature may primarily be mediated by the Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary axis (SAM) in response to stressful situations. Our experiment did not reveal a direct impact of parental HPA manipulation on parental investment (egg or chick temperature), but a potential influence on the partners brooding behaviour (i.e. family-transmitted stress hypothesis).
