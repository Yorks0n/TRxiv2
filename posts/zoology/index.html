Locomotion is thermally sensitive in ectotherms and therefore it is typically expressed differently among thermally heterogenous environments. Locomotion is a complex function, and while physiological and behavioural traits that influence locomotor performance may respond to thermal variation throughout life, other contributing traits, like body shape, may have more restricted responses.">

J.; McGuigan, K.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572202\nLocomotion is thermally sensitive in ectotherms and therefore it is typically expressed differently among thermally heterogenous environments. Locomotion is a complex function, and while physiological and behavioural traits that influence locomotor performance may respond to thermal variation throughout life, other contributing traits, like body shape, may have more restricted responses. How morphology affects locomotor performance under variable temperature conditions is unknown. Here, we investigated three genetically distinct strains of zebrafish (AB, WIK, and Tu) with a shared multi-generational history at 28C. After rearing fish at a constant 28C, we measured prolonged swimming speed (Ucrit) at each of six temperatures (between 16C and 34C). Speed was strongly positively correlated among temperatures, resulting in most among-individual variation being temperature-independent (i.e., fish were relatively fast or slow across all temperatures). However, we also detected significant variation along two axes reflecting temperature-dependent variation, including one reflecting differences among individuals consistent with a hotter-colder tradeoff (i.e., individuals that were relatively fast at cooler temperatures were relatively slow at hotter temperatures and vice versa). Although strains differed in mean swimming performance, within strain (among-individual) patterns of speed variation were markedly consistent. Body shape and size explained significant variation among individuals in both temperature-independent and temperature-dependent axes of swimming speed variation. Notably, morphological traits that were most strongly associated with temperature-independent performance variation (i.e., faster-slower) differed from those associated with temperature-dependent (i.e., hotter-colder) variation. Further, there were significant differences among strains in both the direction and strength of association for specific morphological traits. Our results suggest that thermally heterogenous environments could have complex effects on the evolution of traits that contribute to whole organism performance traits.\nSeasonal tissue-specific gene expression reveals reproductive and stress-related transcriptional systems in wild crown-of-thorns starfish\nAuthors: Morin, M.; Jonsson, M.; Wang, C.; Craik, D. J.; Degnan, S. M.; Degnan, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572276\nAnimals are influenced by the season, yet we know little about the changes that occur in most species throughout the year. This is particularly true in tropical marine animals that experience relatively small annual temperature and daylight changes. Like many coral reef inhabitants, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), well known as a notorious consumer of corals and destroyer of coral reefs, reproduces exclusively in the summer. By comparing gene expression in seven somatic tissues procured from wild COTS sampled on the Great Barrier Reef, we identified more than 2,000 protein-coding genes that change significantly between summer and winter. COTS genes that appear to mediate conspecific communication, including both signalling factors released into the surrounding sea water and cell surface receptors, are upregulated in external secretory and sensory tissues in the summer, often in a sex-specific manner. The sexually dimorphic gene expression appears to be underpinned by sex- and season-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs. There are over 100 TFs that are seasonally expressed, 86% of which are significantly upregulated in the summer. Six nuclear receptors are upregulated in all tissues in the summer, suggesting that systemic seasonal changes are hormonally controlled, as occurs in vertebrates. Unexpectedly, there is a suite of stress-related chaperone proteins and TFs, including HIFa, ATF3, C/EBP, CREB and NF-KB, that are uniquely co-expressed in gravid females. The upregulation of these stress proteins in the summer suggests the demands of oogenesis in this highly fecund starfish affects protein stability and turnover in somatic cells. Together, these circannual changes in COTS gene expression provide novel insights into seasonal changes in this coral reef pest and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities for targeted biocontrol.\n",
