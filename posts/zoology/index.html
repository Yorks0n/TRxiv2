W.\nScore: 57.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566290\nMonoplacophoran molluscs have been dubbed living fossils due to their absence in the fossil record for about 375 million years, until Neopilina galatheae Lemche, 1957 was trawled off Costa Rica in 1952. Since then, over 35 species of living monoplacophorans have been discovered. Nevertheless, in situ observations of these rare deep-sea animals remain scant. Here, we observed and collected an intact specimen of N. galatheae using a remotely operated vehicle from 2460 m deep on the Eastern Galapagos Spreading Center. The animal was found attached to the glassy surface of solidified basalt lava flow, and no feeding trails were found near the animal. Such hard substrate is in contrast with previous records that were trawled on sand and mud, suggesting Neopilina can be found on a wide range of substrates. This is the first time this species was collected since 1959, and represents a southeast range extension of about 1000 km for the species.\nThe greening-causing agent alters the behavioral and electrophysiological responses of the Asian citrus psyllid to a putative sex pheromone\nAuthors: Volpe, H. X. L.; Carmo-Sousa, M.; Luvizotto, R. A. G.; de Freitas, R.; Esperanca, V.; Darolt, J. C.; Pegoraro, A. A. L.; Magalhaes, D. M.; Favaris, A. P.; Wulff, N. A.; Miranda, M. P.; Bento, J. M. S.; Leal, W. S.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566442\nThe Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, is a vector of the pathological bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which causes the most devastating disease to the citrus industry worldwide, known as greening or huanglongbing (HLB). Earlier field tests with an acetic acid-based lure in greening-free, Valencia citrus orange groves in California showed promising results. The same type of lures tested in Sao Paulo, Brazil, showed unsettling results. During the unsuccessful trials, we noticed a relatively large proportion of females in the field, ultimately leading us to test field-collected males and females for Wolbachia and CLas. The results showed high rates of Wolbachia and CLas infection in field populations. We then compared the olfactory responses of laboratory-raised, CLas-free, and CLas-infected males to acetic acid. As previously reported, CLas-uninfected males responded to acetic acid at 1 {micro}g. Surprisingly, CLas-infected males required 50x higher doses of the putative sex pheromone, thus explaining the failure to capture CLas-infected males in the field. CLas infection was also manifested in electrophysiological responses. Electroantennogram responses from CLas-infected ACP males were significantly higher than those obtained with uninfected males. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogen infection affecting a vectors response to a sex attractant.\nLeveraging whole genome sequencing to promote genetic diversity and population health in zoo-housed western lowland gorillas\nAuthors: Gorzynski, J.; Danforth, M. D.; Strong, V.; Kutinsky, I.; Murphy, H.; Lowenstine, L.; Priest, J. R.; Ashley, E. A.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.565567\nThe sustainability of zoo populations is dependent on maintaining genetic diversity and controlling heritable disease. Here, we explore the integration of whole genome sequencing data in the management of the international zoological population of western lowland gorillas, focusing on genetic diversity and heritable diseases. By comparing kinship values derived from classical pedigree mapping and whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that genomic data provides a more sensitive measure of relatedness. Our analysis reveals a decrease in genetic diversity due to closed breeding, emphasizing the potential for genetic intervention to mitigate negative impact on population fitness. We identify contributing factors to the decreasing genetic diversity including breeding within a closed population, unknown kinship among potential mates, and disproportionate genetic contributions from individual founders. Additionally, we highlight idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (IMF), a common cardiovascular pathology observed in zoologically housed gorillas, and identify a novel genetic variant in the TNNI3K gene that appears to be associated with this condition. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating molecular data into ex-situ population management strategies, and advocate for the adoption of advanced genomic techniques to optimize the genetic health and diversity of zoologically housed western lowland gorillas.\nTicks without borders: Microbial communities of immature Neotropical tick species parasitizing migratory landbirds along northern Gulf of Mexico\nAuthors: Karim, S.; Zenzal, T. J.; Beati, L.; Sen, R.; Adegoke, A.; Kumar, D.; Downs, L.; Keko, M.; Nussbaum, A.; Becker, D.; Moore, F.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563347\nThe long-distance, seasonal migrations of birds make them an effective ecological bridge for the movement of ticks. The introduction of exotic tick species to new geographical regions can lead to the emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens or the re-emergence of previously eradicated ones. This study assessed the prevalence of exotic tick species parasitizing resident, short-distance, and long-distance songbirds during spring and autumn at stopover sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico using the mitochondrial 12S rDNA gene. Birds were captured for tick collection from six different sites from late August to early November in both 2018 and 2019. The highest number of ticks were collected in the 2019 season. Most ticks were collected off the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and 54% of the total ticks collected were from Grand Chenier, LA. A high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing approach was followed to characterize the microbial communities and identify pathogenic microbes in all tick samples. Tick microbial communities, diversity, and community structure were determined using quantitative insight into microbial ecology (QIIME). The sparse correlations for compositional data (SparCC) approach was then used to construct microbial network maps and infer microbial correlations. A total of 421 individual ticks in the genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes were recorded from 28 songbird species, of which Amblyomma and Amblyomma longirostre was the most abundant tick genus and species, respectively. Microbial profiles showed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The most abundant bacteria include the pathogenic Rickettsia and endosymbiont Francisella, Candidatus Midichloria, and Spiroplasma. BLAST analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Rickettsia sequences revealed the highest similarities to pathogenic spotted and non-spotted fever groups, including R. buchneri, R. conorii, R. prowazekii, R. bellii, R. australis, R. parkeri, R. monacensis, and R. monteiroi. Permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the relative abundance of Francisella and Rickettsia drives microbial patterns across the tick genera. We also observed a higher percentage of positive correlations in microbe-microbe interactions among members of the microbial communities. Network analysis suggested a negative correlation between a) Francisella and Rickettsia and, b) Francisella and Cutibacterium. Lastly, mapping the distributions of bird species parasitized during spring migrations highlighted geographic hotspots where migratory songbirds could disperse ticks and their pathogens at stopover sites or upon arrival to their breeding grounds, the latter showing means dispersal distances from 421-5003 kilometers. These findings strongly highlight the potential role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.

During the unsuccessful trials, we noticed a relatively large proportion of females in the field, ultimately leading us to test field-collected males and females for Wolbachia and CLas. The results showed high rates of Wolbachia and CLas infection in field populations. We then compared the olfactory responses of laboratory-raised, CLas-free, and CLas-infected males to acetic acid. As previously reported, CLas-uninfected males responded to acetic acid at 1 {micro}g. Surprisingly, CLas-infected males required 50x higher doses of the putative sex pheromone, thus explaining the failure to capture CLas-infected males in the field. CLas infection was also manifested in electrophysiological responses. Electroantennogram responses from CLas-infected ACP males were significantly higher than those obtained with uninfected males. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogen infection affecting a vectors response to a sex attractant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The sustainability of zoo populations is dependent on maintaining genetic diversity and controlling heritable disease. Here, we explore the integration of whole genome sequencing data in the management of the international zoological population of western lowland gorillas, focusing on genetic diversity and heritable diseases. By comparing kinship values derived from classical pedigree mapping and whole genome sequencing, we demonstrate that genomic data provides a more sensitive measure of relatedness. Our analysis reveals a decrease in genetic diversity due to closed breeding, emphasizing the potential for genetic intervention to mitigate negative impact on population fitness. We identify contributing factors to the decreasing genetic diversity including breeding within a closed population, unknown kinship among potential mates, and disproportionate genetic contributions from individual founders. Additionally, we highlight idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (IMF), a common cardiovascular pathology observed in zoologically housed gorillas, and identify a novel genetic variant in the TNNI3K gene that appears to be associated with this condition. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating molecular data into ex-situ population management strategies, and advocate for the adoption of advanced genomic techniques to optimize the genetic health and diversity of zoologically housed western lowland gorillas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The long-distance, seasonal migrations of birds make them an effective ecological bridge for the movement of ticks. The introduction of exotic tick species to new geographical regions can lead to the emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens or the re-emergence of previously eradicated ones. This study assessed the prevalence of exotic tick species parasitizing resident, short-distance, and long-distance songbirds during spring and autumn at stopover sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico using the mitochondrial 12S rDNA gene. Birds were captured for tick collection from six different sites from late August to early November in both 2018 and 2019. The highest number of ticks were collected in the 2019 season. Most ticks were collected off the Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) and Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and 54% of the total ticks collected were from Grand Chenier, LA. A high throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing approach was followed to characterize the microbial communities and identify pathogenic microbes in all tick samples. Tick microbial communities, diversity, and community structure were determined using quantitative insight into microbial ecology (QIIME). The sparse correlations for compositional data (SparCC) approach was then used to construct microbial network maps and infer microbial correlations. A total of 421 individual ticks in the genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes were recorded from 28 songbird species, of which Amblyomma and Amblyomma longirostre was the most abundant tick genus and species, respectively. Microbial profiles showed that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The most abundant bacteria include the pathogenic Rickettsia and endosymbiont Francisella, Candidatus Midichloria, and Spiroplasma. BLAST analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of the Rickettsia sequences revealed the highest similarities to pathogenic spotted and non-spotted fever groups, including R. buchneri, R. conorii, R. prowazekii, R. bellii, R. australis, R. parkeri, R. monacensis, and R. monteiroi. Permutation multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the relative abundance of Francisella and Rickettsia drives microbial patterns across the tick genera. We also observed a higher percentage of positive correlations in microbe-microbe interactions among members of the microbial communities. Network analysis suggested a negative correlation between a) Francisella and Rickettsia and, b) Francisella and Cutibacterium. Lastly, mapping the distributions of bird species parasitized during spring migrations highlighted geographic hotspots where migratory songbirds could disperse ticks and their pathogens at stopover sites or upon arrival to their breeding grounds, the latter showing means dispersal distances from 421-5003 kilometers. These findings strongly highlight the potential role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.
