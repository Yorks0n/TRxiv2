Each museum is built around one or more biological collections that serve as a repository of important materials for study, which have contributed to scientific research in increasingly important areas ranging from understanding global climate change to developing new biotechnological applications. However, despite centuries of existence, global collections sizes have only been recently estimated, and aside from analyses of certain institutions or well-studied clades, little is known about how patterns of collecting activity across institutions, geographic regions, or taxonomic clades, or how these patterns vary across time. To address this important gap in our understanding of critical life sciences infrastructure, I gathered and analyzed zoological records associated with preserved specimens collected between 1900 and 2015 and housed in worldwide natural history collections using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. My analysis indicated that global, museum-associated collecting activity focused on animals has varied greatly over time, peaking around 2000 and declining significantly since. By stratifying data by institution, nation, and taxonomic phylum and class, I also illuminated how individual data series contribute to these global patterns. Institutions and nations had either concentrated or dispersed periods of relatively high collecting activity that occurred over different time periods, although most growth occurred in the second half of the 20th century for both many individual institutions and globally. Certain taxonomic clades comprise the largest proportions of collections records over this time period, namely arthropods (especially insects) and chordates (especially vertebrates), underscoring the taxonomically biased collecting histories of many institutions. Altogether, my analyses provide a critical, early view of historical zoological collecting activity and, to help other museum stakeholders to explore the data and results in more depth, I also describe and release NHMinformatics, an interactive dashboard built using R Shiny. These resources, when combined with recommendations I have made for sustainable collections growth, will be helpful for establishing policy goals, provisioning museum infrastructure, and training curatorial personnel.\nHeat Tolerance is Affected by the Gut Microbiota in a Vertebrate Ectotherm\nAuthors: Dallas, J. W.; Kazarina, A.; Lee, S. T. M.; Warne, R. W.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556683\nThe gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.\nMechanical and elemental characterization of ant mandibles: consequences for bite mechanics\nAuthors: Klunk, C. L.; Heethoff, M.; Hammel, J. U.; Gorb, S.; Krings, W.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558673\nChewing with the mandibles is a food processing behavior observed in most current insect lineages. Mandible morphology has an essential role in biting behavior and food processing capacity. However, the mandible cuticle can have regional differences in its mechanical properties, associated or not with the accumulation of elements that increase cuticle stiffness. The effects of such a heterogeneous distribution of cuticle material properties in the mandible responses to biting loading are still poorly explored in chewing insects. Here we measured the elemental composition and material properties of workers of an ant species, Formica cunicularia, and tested the effects of the cuticular variation in Youngs modulus (E) under bite-loading with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We divided worker mandibles into four regions that we expect would vary in elemental composition and material properties, namely the masticatory margin, mandible blade, ventral (VMA), and dorsal (DMA) mandibular articulations with the head. Specifically, we expect the masticatory margin will show higher cuticular hardness (H) and E values, followed by the mandibular joints and the mandible blade. We also predict that such cuticle material properties variation is functionally relevant under bite-loading, changing stress patterns when compared to the mechanical responses of a mandible with a homogeneous distribution of material properties. To measure elemental composition, we used energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy, while H and E were accessed through nanoindentation tests. Mandible mechanical responses to bite-loading were tested with FEA, comparing a mandible with a homogeneous versus a heterogeneous E distribution. As expected, the mandibular regions showed distinct proportions of relevant elements, like Cu and Zn, with the masticatory margin showing the higher levels of those elements, followed by the mandibular articulations with the head and the mandible blade. The same pattern was observed regarding the values of cuticle H and E. When incorporated into FEA, this variation in E effectively changed mandible stress patterns, leading to a higher concentration of stresses in the stiffer mandibular regions, letting the softer mandible blade with relatively lower stress levels. Our results demonstrated the relevance of cuticle heterogeneity in mechanical properties to deal with bite-loading demands and suggest that the accumulation of transition metals such as Cu and Zn has a relevant correlation with such mechanical characteristics of the mandible in this ant species.\nAn integrative taxonomic treatment of the Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) from Singapore reveals 115 new species on 730km2\nAuthors: Amorim, D. d. S.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Srivathsan, A.; Meier, R.\nScore: 49.7, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.555672\n\"Open ended\" or \"dark taxa\" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu \u0026 Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu \u0026 Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Natural history museums comprise a unique and important component of biological infrastructure worldwide, and underlie diverse research, education, and outreach in the natural sciences. Each museum is built around one or more biological collections that serve as a repository of important materials for study, which have contributed to scientific research in increasingly important areas ranging from understanding global climate change to developing new biotechnological applications. However, despite centuries of existence, global collections sizes have only been recently estimated, and aside from analyses of certain institutions or well-studied clades, little is known about how patterns of collecting activity across institutions, geographic regions, or taxonomic clades, or how these patterns vary across time. To address this important gap in our understanding of critical life sciences infrastructure, I gathered and analyzed zoological records associated with preserved specimens collected between 1900 and 2015 and housed in worldwide natural history collections using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. My analysis indicated that global, museum-associated collecting activity focused on animals has varied greatly over time, peaking around 2000 and declining significantly since. By stratifying data by institution, nation, and taxonomic phylum and class, I also illuminated how individual data series contribute to these global patterns. Institutions and nations had either concentrated or dispersed periods of relatively high collecting activity that occurred over different time periods, although most growth occurred in the second half of the 20th century for both many individual institutions and globally. Certain taxonomic clades comprise the largest proportions of collections records over this time period, namely arthropods (especially insects) and chordates (especially vertebrates), underscoring the taxonomically biased collecting histories of many institutions. Altogether, my analyses provide a critical, early view of historical zoological collecting activity and, to help other museum stakeholders to explore the data and results in more depth, I also describe and release NHMinformatics, an interactive dashboard built using R Shiny. These resources, when combined with recommendations I have made for sustainable collections growth, will be helpful for establishing policy goals, provisioning museum infrastructure, and training curatorial personnel.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chewing with the mandibles is a food processing behavior observed in most current insect lineages. Mandible morphology has an essential role in biting behavior and food processing capacity. However, the mandible cuticle can have regional differences in its mechanical properties, associated or not with the accumulation of elements that increase cuticle stiffness. The effects of such a heterogeneous distribution of cuticle material properties in the mandible responses to biting loading are still poorly explored in chewing insects. Here we measured the elemental composition and material properties of workers of an ant species, Formica cunicularia, and tested the effects of the cuticular variation in Youngs modulus (E) under bite-loading with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We divided worker mandibles into four regions that we expect would vary in elemental composition and material properties, namely the masticatory margin, mandible blade, ventral (VMA), and dorsal (DMA) mandibular articulations with the head. Specifically, we expect the masticatory margin will show higher cuticular hardness (H) and E values, followed by the mandibular joints and the mandible blade. We also predict that such cuticle material properties variation is functionally relevant under bite-loading, changing stress patterns when compared to the mechanical responses of a mandible with a homogeneous distribution of material properties. To measure elemental composition, we used energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy, while H and E were accessed through nanoindentation tests. Mandible mechanical responses to bite-loading were tested with FEA, comparing a mandible with a homogeneous versus a heterogeneous E distribution. As expected, the mandibular regions showed distinct proportions of relevant elements, like Cu and Zn, with the masticatory margin showing the higher levels of those elements, followed by the mandibular articulations with the head and the mandible blade. The same pattern was observed regarding the values of cuticle H and E. When incorporated into FEA, this variation in E effectively changed mandible stress patterns, leading to a higher concentration of stresses in the stiffer mandibular regions, letting the softer mandible blade with relatively lower stress levels. Our results demonstrated the relevance of cuticle heterogeneity in mechanical properties to deal with bite-loading demands and suggest that the accumulation of transition metals such as Cu and Zn has a relevant correlation with such mechanical characteristics of the mandible in this ant species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Open ended&#34; or &#34;dark taxa&#34; are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu &amp; Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu &amp; Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.</p>
