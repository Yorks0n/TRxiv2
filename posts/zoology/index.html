W.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556683\nThe gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.\nMechanical and elemental characterization of ant mandibles: consequences for bite mechanics\nAuthors: Klunk, C. L.; Heethoff, M.; Hammel, J. U.; Gorb, S.; Krings, W.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558673\nChewing with the mandibles is a food processing behavior observed in most current insect lineages. Mandible morphology has an essential role in biting behavior and food processing capacity. However, the mandible cuticle can have regional differences in its mechanical properties, associated or not with the accumulation of elements that increase cuticle stiffness. The effects of such a heterogeneous distribution of cuticle material properties in the mandible responses to biting loading are still poorly explored in chewing insects. Here we measured the elemental composition and material properties of workers of an ant species, Formica cunicularia, and tested the effects of the cuticular variation in Youngs modulus (E) under bite-loading with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We divided worker mandibles into four regions that we expect would vary in elemental composition and material properties, namely the masticatory margin, mandible blade, ventral (VMA), and dorsal (DMA) mandibular articulations with the head. Specifically, we expect the masticatory margin will show higher cuticular hardness (H) and E values, followed by the mandibular joints and the mandible blade. We also predict that such cuticle material properties variation is functionally relevant under bite-loading, changing stress patterns when compared to the mechanical responses of a mandible with a homogeneous distribution of material properties. To measure elemental composition, we used energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy, while H and E were accessed through nanoindentation tests. Mandible mechanical responses to bite-loading were tested with FEA, comparing a mandible with a homogeneous versus a heterogeneous E distribution. As expected, the mandibular regions showed distinct proportions of relevant elements, like Cu and Zn, with the masticatory margin showing the higher levels of those elements, followed by the mandibular articulations with the head and the mandible blade. The same pattern was observed regarding the values of cuticle H and E. When incorporated into FEA, this variation in E effectively changed mandible stress patterns, leading to a higher concentration of stresses in the stiffer mandibular regions, letting the softer mandible blade with relatively lower stress levels. Our results demonstrated the relevance of cuticle heterogeneity in mechanical properties to deal with bite-loading demands and suggest that the accumulation of transition metals such as Cu and Zn has a relevant correlation with such mechanical characteristics of the mandible in this ant species.\nAn integrative taxonomic treatment of the Mycetophilidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) from Singapore reveals 115 new species on 730km2\nAuthors: Amorim, D. d. S.; Oliveira, S. S.; Balbi, M. I. P. A.; Ang, Y.; Yeo, D.; Srivathsan, A.; Meier, R.\nScore: 51.4, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.555672\n\"Open ended\" or \"dark taxa\" are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu \u0026 Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu \u0026 Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.\nAssessing molecular phylogenetics of Hydroptilidae (Trichoptera) subfamily lineages, with notes on biogeography\nAuthors: Murray-Stoker, K. M.; McCauley, S. J.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558543\nThe microcaddisfly family Hydroptilidae is the most species-rich within the insect order Trichoptera and has a global distribution. The taxonomy and systematics of this group remains understudied in proportion to its diversity. Here, we present a phylogenetic assessment of subfamily relationships that includes five of the six Hydroptilidae subfamilies (Hydroptilinae, Leucotrichiinae, Ochrotrichiinae, Orthotrichiinae, and Stactobiinae) using publicly available molecular data. Our analyses recovered Leucotrichiinae, Ochrotrichiinae, and Stactobiinae as monophyletic and Hydroptilinae as paraphyletic. Based on the diversity and distribution of taxa, much more representation of species is needed to fully understand the relationships of subfamilies; however, our results suggest a need to revisit the placement of Ithytrichia, which concurs with other recent molecular work on Hydroptilidae. Further clarity into the relationships of Hydroptilidae will be important for understanding the variability and phylogenetic signal of ecological traits.\nPersonality heterophily and friendship as drivers for successful cooperation\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Waasdorp, S.; Middelburg, E.; Sterck, E. H. M.; Massen, J. J. M.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558534\nCooperation is widespread and arguably a pivotal evolutionary force in maintaining animal societies. Yet, proximately, what underlying motivators drive individuals to cooperate remains relatively unclear. Since free-riders can exploit the benefits by cheating, selecting the right partner is paramount. Such decision rules need not be based on complex calculations and can be driven by cognitively less-demanding mechanisms, like social relationships (e.g., kinship, non-kin friendships, dyadic tolerance), social status (e.g., dominance hierarchies) and personalities (social and non-social traits); however, holistic evidence related to those mechanisms is scarce. Using the classical loose-string paradigm, we tested cooperative tendencies of a hierarchical primate, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). We studied three groups (n=32) in social settings, allowing free partner choice. We supplemented cooperation with observational and experimental data on social relationships, dominance hierarchies, and personality. Friendship and dissimilarity in a non-social exploration personality trait predicted the likelihood of cooperative dyad formation. Furthermore, the magnitude of cooperative success was positively associated with friendship, low rank-distance, and dissimilarity in an activity-sociability personality trait. Kinship did not affect cooperation. While some findings align with prior studies, the evidence of (non-social)personality heterophily promoting cooperation may deepen our understanding of the proximate mechanisms and, broadly, the evolution of cooperation.\nMosquitoes do not like bitter: new perspectives for biorational repellents\nAuthors: Lazzari, C. R.; Ortega-Insaurralde, I.; Esnault, J.; Costa, E.; Crespo, J. E.; Barrozo, R. B.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558838\nChemical repellents play a crucial role in personal protection, serving as essential elements in reducing the transmission of vector-borne diseases. A biorational perspective that extends beyond the olfactory system as the classical target may be a promising direction to move. The taste system provides reliable information regarding food quality, helping animals discriminate between nutritious and potentially harmful food sources, often associated with a bitter taste. Understanding how bitter compounds affect feeding in blood-sucking insects could unveil novel molecules with the potential to reduce biting and feeding. Here, we investigated the impact of two naturally occurring bitter compounds, caffeine and quinine, on the feeding decisions in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at two distinctive phases: (1) when the mosquito explores the biting substrate using external taste sensors and (2) when the mosquito takes a sip of food and tastes it using internal taste receptors. We assessed the aversiveness of bitter compounds through both an artificial feeding condition (artificial feeder test) and a real host (arm-in-cage test). Our findings revealed different sensitivities in the external and internal sensory pathways responsible for detecting bitter taste in Ae. aegypti. Internal detectors exhibited responsiveness to lower doses compared to the external sensors. Quinine exerted a more pronounced negative impact on biting and feeding activity than caffeine. The implications of our findings are discussed in the context of mosquito food recognition and the potential practical implications for personal protection.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The gut microbiota is known to influence and have regulatory effects in diverse physiological functions of host animals, but only recently has the relationship between host thermal biology and gut microbiota been explored. Here, we examined how early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota in larval amphibians influenced their critical thermal maximum (CTmax) at different acclimation temperatures. We removed the resident microbiome on the outside of wild-caught wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) egg masses via an antibiotic wash, and then either maintained eggs without a microbiota or inoculated eggs with pond water or the intestinal microbiota of another species, green frogs (L. clamitans), that have a wider thermal tolerance. We predicted that this cross-species transplant would improve the CTmax of the recipient wood frog larvae relative to the other treatments. In line with this prediction, green frog-recipient larvae had the highest CTmax while those with no inoculum had the lowest CTmax. Both the microbiome treatment and acclimation temperature significantly influenced the larval gut microbiota communities and alpha diversity indices. Green frog inoculated larvae were enriched in Rikenellaceae relative to the other treatments, which produce short-chain fatty acids and could contribute to greater energy availability and enhanced heat tolerance. Larvae that received no inoculation had higher relative abundances of potentially pathogenic Aeromonas spp., which negatively affects host health and performance. Our results are the first to show that cross-species gut microbiota transplants alter heat tolerance in a predictive manner. This finding has repercussions for the conservation of species that are threatened by climate change and demonstrates a need to further explore the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates host thermal tolerance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chewing with the mandibles is a food processing behavior observed in most current insect lineages. Mandible morphology has an essential role in biting behavior and food processing capacity. However, the mandible cuticle can have regional differences in its mechanical properties, associated or not with the accumulation of elements that increase cuticle stiffness. The effects of such a heterogeneous distribution of cuticle material properties in the mandible responses to biting loading are still poorly explored in chewing insects. Here we measured the elemental composition and material properties of workers of an ant species, Formica cunicularia, and tested the effects of the cuticular variation in Youngs modulus (E) under bite-loading with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We divided worker mandibles into four regions that we expect would vary in elemental composition and material properties, namely the masticatory margin, mandible blade, ventral (VMA), and dorsal (DMA) mandibular articulations with the head. Specifically, we expect the masticatory margin will show higher cuticular hardness (H) and E values, followed by the mandibular joints and the mandible blade. We also predict that such cuticle material properties variation is functionally relevant under bite-loading, changing stress patterns when compared to the mechanical responses of a mandible with a homogeneous distribution of material properties. To measure elemental composition, we used energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy, while H and E were accessed through nanoindentation tests. Mandible mechanical responses to bite-loading were tested with FEA, comparing a mandible with a homogeneous versus a heterogeneous E distribution. As expected, the mandibular regions showed distinct proportions of relevant elements, like Cu and Zn, with the masticatory margin showing the higher levels of those elements, followed by the mandibular articulations with the head and the mandible blade. The same pattern was observed regarding the values of cuticle H and E. When incorporated into FEA, this variation in E effectively changed mandible stress patterns, leading to a higher concentration of stresses in the stiffer mandibular regions, letting the softer mandible blade with relatively lower stress levels. Our results demonstrated the relevance of cuticle heterogeneity in mechanical properties to deal with bite-loading demands and suggest that the accumulation of transition metals such as Cu and Zn has a relevant correlation with such mechanical characteristics of the mandible in this ant species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Open ended&#34; or &#34;dark taxa&#34; are species-rich clades that are so abundant and diverse that conventional taxonomic methods tend to struggle with the onslaught of specimens and species. New approaches based on presorting specimens to putative species with affordable barcodes may make tackling these taxa manageable. However, this will still require limiting the geographic scope of revisions, given that most countries and biogeographic regions will have too many specimens and species for comprehensive coverage. We demonstrate the power of this approach by carrying out a revision of the fungus gnats (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) of Singapore. The material revised here was obtained from 496 Malaise trap samples caught by 71 Malaise traps placed at 107 collecting sites in different habitats: mangroves, swamp forests, freshwater swamps, primary rainforests, and different types of secondary forests (old, maturing, young, urban). Based on molecular and morphological data for more than 1,456 specimens, we delimit 120 species with molecular and morphological data. Of these, only 4 or 5 are species previously described. The remaining 115 are new to science and described here. However, we only name only 99 species, since two species lacks molecular data and 14 others are currently only known from females where we cannot prepare a fully satisfying morphological diagnosis. The match ratio between morphology and standard MOTUs (3% clusters) was overall high (95%) with even higher match ratios (99%) observed for 5% Objective Clustering and MOTUs obtained with ABGD (P=0.060). Overall, the ratio of undescribed to described is an astonishing 23:1., Only revising the Singapore fauna increases the number of described species of Oriental Mycetophilidae by over 25%. This highlights the size of the taxonomic impediment for fungus gnats. Most of the Singapore Mycetophilidae diversity belongs to three of 22 genera--Neoempheria Osten-Sacken (31 species), Epicypta Winnertz (29 species) and Manota Williston (14 species), but we also describe a new genus, Integricypta, gen. n. based on three species. It belongs to Mycetophilinae Mycetophilini and is the putative sistergroup of Aspidionia Colless. The species sequenced, illustrated, and named are: Leptomorphus rafflesi, sp. n.; Monoclona simhapura, sp. n.; Azana demeijeri, sp. n.; Azana leekongchiani, sp. n. (Sciophilinae); Tetragoneura crawfurdi, sp. n.; Tetragoneura chola, sp. n.; Tetragoneura dayuan, sp. n.; Tetragoneura farquhari, sp. n.; Ectrepesthoneura johor, sp. n.

(Mycetophilinae). The previously described species are: Metanepsia malaysiana Kallweit, Eumanota racola Soli, Parempheriella defectiva (Edwards), and Neoempheria dizonalis (Edwards) (all known from Sumatra and/or the Malaysian peninsula). Two females belong to a species of Chalastonepsia that may be one of the described species of the genus. The gnoristine genus Vecella Wu &amp; Yang is here proposed as a new synonym to Parempheriella, with P. guadunana (Wu &amp; Yang), n. comb., corresponding to an additional Palearctic species of the genus. Barcodes for a second set of 1,567 specimens suggest the presence of an additional 24 MOTUs. We thus estimate that approximately 85% of all the species that routinely enter Malaise traps are here identified or described. The revision concludes with a discussion of the biogeography and generic composition of the mycetophilid fauna at the southern end of the Malay Peninsula.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microcaddisfly family Hydroptilidae is the most species-rich within the insect order Trichoptera and has a global distribution. The taxonomy and systematics of this group remains understudied in proportion to its diversity. Here, we present a phylogenetic assessment of subfamily relationships that includes five of the six Hydroptilidae subfamilies (Hydroptilinae, Leucotrichiinae, Ochrotrichiinae, Orthotrichiinae, and Stactobiinae) using publicly available molecular data. Our analyses recovered Leucotrichiinae, Ochrotrichiinae, and Stactobiinae as monophyletic and Hydroptilinae as paraphyletic. Based on the diversity and distribution of taxa, much more representation of species is needed to fully understand the relationships of subfamilies; however, our results suggest a need to revisit the placement of Ithytrichia, which concurs with other recent molecular work on Hydroptilidae. Further clarity into the relationships of Hydroptilidae will be important for understanding the variability and phylogenetic signal of ecological traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cooperation is widespread and arguably a pivotal evolutionary force in maintaining animal societies. Yet, proximately, what underlying motivators drive individuals to cooperate remains relatively unclear. Since  free-riders can exploit the benefits by cheating, selecting the right partner is paramount. Such decision rules need not be based on complex calculations and can be driven by cognitively less-demanding mechanisms, like social relationships (e.g., kinship, non-kin friendships, dyadic tolerance), social status (e.g., dominance hierarchies) and personalities (social and non-social traits); however, holistic evidence related to those mechanisms is scarce. Using the classical  loose-string paradigm, we tested cooperative tendencies of a hierarchical primate, the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). We studied three groups (n=32) in social settings, allowing free partner choice. We supplemented cooperation with observational and experimental data on social relationships, dominance hierarchies, and personality. Friendship and dissimilarity in a non-social  exploration personality trait predicted the likelihood of cooperative dyad formation. Furthermore, the magnitude of cooperative success was positively associated with friendship, low rank-distance, and dissimilarity in an  activity-sociability personality trait. Kinship did not affect cooperation. While some findings align with prior studies, the evidence of (non-social)personality heterophily promoting cooperation may deepen our understanding of the proximate mechanisms and, broadly, the evolution of cooperation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chemical repellents play a crucial role in personal protection, serving as essential elements in reducing the transmission of vector-borne diseases. A biorational perspective that extends beyond the olfactory system as the classical target may be a promising direction to move. The taste system provides reliable information regarding food quality, helping animals discriminate between nutritious and potentially harmful food sources, often associated with a bitter taste. Understanding how bitter compounds affect feeding in blood-sucking insects could unveil novel molecules with the potential to reduce biting and feeding. Here, we investigated the impact of two naturally occurring bitter compounds, caffeine and quinine, on the feeding decisions in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at two distinctive phases: (1) when the mosquito explores the biting substrate using external taste sensors and (2) when the mosquito takes a sip of food and tastes it using internal taste receptors. We assessed the aversiveness of bitter compounds through both an artificial feeding condition (artificial feeder test) and a real host (arm-in-cage test). Our findings revealed different sensitivities in the external and internal sensory pathways responsible for detecting bitter taste in Ae. aegypti. Internal detectors exhibited responsiveness to lower doses compared to the external sensors. Quinine exerted a more pronounced negative impact on biting and feeding activity than caffeine. The implications of our findings are discussed in the context of mosquito food recognition and the potential practical implications for personal protection.</p>
