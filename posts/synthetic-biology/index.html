Advancements in generative AI have paved the way for designing synthetic sequences with the aim of safely and accurately modulating gene expression. We leverage diffusion models to design context-specific DNA regulatory sequences, which hold significant potential toward enabling novel therapeutic applications requiring precise modulation of gene expression. Our framework uses a cell type-specific diffusion model to generate synthetic 200 bp regulatory elements based on chromatin accessibility across different cell types. We evaluate the generated sequences based on key metrics to ensure they retain properties of endogenous sequences: transcription factor binding site composition, potential for cell type-specific chromatin accessibility, and capacity for sequences generated by DNA diffusion to activate gene expression in different cell contexts using state-of-the-art prediction models. Our results demonstrate the ability to robustly generate DNA sequences with cell type-specific regulatory potential. DNA-Diffusion paves the way for revolutionizing a regulatory modulation approach to mammalian synthetic biology and precision gene therapy.\nCRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE) for RNA-based gene editing and delivery\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Lin, R.-Z.; Harris, M.; Lavayen, B.; Mccreedy, B.; Getts, D.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577809\nTo realize the potential of genome editing for broad therapeutic applications, new tools are needed for delivery of multi-kilobase (kb) payloads at desired genomic sites with high precision. Here we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), an RNA-based genome editing system that merges CRISPR/Cas9 with the human L1 retrotransposon to insert gene-sized payloads without DNA donors or double strand breaks. CREATE enables L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration of an RNA-encoded payload gene specifically at two Cas9-induced nick sites. CREATE is delivered using mRNA components and achieves integration of \u003e1 kb payload in mammalian cells, opening the door to mRNA mediated therapeutic genome editing in vivo.

K.; Lucci, T. J.; Jung, J. K.; Shekhawat, G. S.; Lucks, J. B.; Dravid, V. P. B.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578376\nWater contamination is a growing global concern, creating a need to develop technologies that can detect a range of target compounds at the required thresholds. Here, we address this need by merging biological allosteric transcription factors with DNA coated nanomechanical microcantilevers to detect chemicals in water with digital readout. After proof-of-concept demonstration and optimization to detect tetracycline with the TetR transcription factor, we use the CadC transcription factor to detect Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water at concentrations down to 2 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively, in less than fifteen minutes. A computational model suggests this improvement in sensitivity could be achieved by the DNA coated microcantilever surface changing transcription factor binding properties. Our findings demonstrate a promising new approach for water quality monitoring with fast, highly sensitive, digital readouts.\nFunctional Modification of Cyanobacterial Phycobiliprotein and Phycobilisomes through Bilin Metabolism Control\nAuthors: Sato, M.; Kawaguchi, T.; Maeda, K.; Watanabe, M.; Ikeuchi, M.; Narikawa, R.; Watanabe, S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.04.578791\nThe light-harvesting antenna complexes in cyanobacteria are known as phycobilisomes (PBSs), and they can adapt to a diverse range of light environments owing to the deployment of different phycobiliproteins within the PBS structures. Freshwater cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 thrive under red light due to phycocyanin (PC), along with phycocyanobilin (PCB), in PBS. Conversely, cyanobacteria in shorter-wavelength light environments, such as green light, employ phycoerythrin paired with phycoerythrobilin (PEB) alongside PC in PBS. Synthetic biology studies have shown that PEB production can be enhanced by additional expression of the heterologous PEB synthases, namely 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and PEB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebAB), leading to cellular browning due to PEB accumulation. This approach is genetically unstable, and the properties of the resulting PEB-bound PBS complexes remain uncharacterized. Herein, we engineered a novel strain of Synechococcus 7942 PEB1, with finely tuned control of PEB metabolism. PEB1 exhibited a remarkable and reversible color shift from green to brown and pink, based on the PebAB induction levels. High induction led to a complete PCB-to-PEB substitution, causing the disassembly of the PBS rod complex. In contrast, low PebAB levels resulted in the formation of a stable chimeric PBS complex with partial PCB-to-PEB substitution. This adaptation enabled efficient light harvesting in the green spectrum and energy transfer to the photosynthetic reaction center. These findings, which improve our understanding of PBS and highlight the structural importance of the bilin composition, lay the foundation for future PBS adaptation studies in bioengineering, synthetic biology, and renewable energy.\nThe integration of tandem gene repeats via a bacterial type-II toxin-antitoxin-mediated gene amplification (ToxAmp) system and stability visualisation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nAuthors: Evans, S.; Lu, Z.; McDonnell, L.; Anderson, W.; Peralta, F.; Watkins, T.; Ahmed, H.; Luna-Flores, C. H.; Loan, T. D.; Navone, L.; Trau, M.; Scott, C.; Speight, R.; Vickers, C.; Peng, B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578080\nTandem gene repeats naturally occur as important genomic features and determine many traits in living organisms, like human diseases and microbial productivities of target bioproducts. Here, we develop a bacterial type-II toxin-antitoxin-mediated method to manipulate genomic integration of tandem gene repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and further visualise the evolutionary trajectories of gene repeats. We designed a tri-vector system to introduce toxin-antitoxin-driven gene amplification (ToxAmp) modules, and accidentally re-visited the high-level capacity of multi-fragment co-transformation in S. cerevisiae. This system delivered the multi-copy gene integration in the form of tandem gene repeats spontaneously and independently from toxin-antitoxin-mediated selection. Inducing the toxin (RelE) expressing via a copper (II)-inducible CUP1 promoter successfully drove the in-situ gene amplification of the antitoxin (RelB) module, resulting in [~]40 copies of a green fluorescence reporter (GFP) gene per copy of genome. The copy-number changes, increasing and decreasing, and stable maintenance were visualised using the GFP and blue chromoprotein AeBlue as reporters. Copy-number increasing happened spontaneously not depending on a selection pressure and was quickly enriched through toxin-antitoxin-mediated selection. In summary, the bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems provide a flexible mechanism to manipulate gene copy number in eukaryotic cells and can be exploited for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications.

A wide range of genetic parts and genome engineering methods have already been developed. However, there is still a need for a well-characterized tool to effectively and gradually reduce the expression level of native genes. To bridge this gap, we created graded-CRISPRi, a system utilizing gRNA variants that lead to varying levels of repression strength. By incorporating multiple gRNA sequences into our design, we successfully extended this concept to simultaneously repress four distinct reporter genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capability of using graded-CRISPRi to target native genes, thereby examining the effect of various knockdown levels on growth.\nxTrimoPGLM: Unified 100B-Scale Pre-trained Transformer for Deciphering the Language of Protein\nAuthors: Chen, B.; Cheng, X.; Li, P.; Gengyang, L.-a.; Gong, J.; Li, S.; Bei, Z.; Tan, X.; Wang, B.; Zeng, X.; Liu, C.; Zeng, A.; Dong, Y.; Tang, J.; Song, L.\nScore: 97.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547496\nProtein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. We propose a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pre-training framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that 1) xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in 18 protein understanding benchmarks across four categories. The model also facilitates an atomic-resolution view of protein structures, leading to an advanced 3D structural prediction model that surpasses existing language model-based tools. 2) xTrimoPGLM not only can generate de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones, but also can perform programmable generation after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated sequences. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences, contributing to the evolving landscape of foundation models in protein science.\nEnhanced Sequence-Activity Mapping and Evolution of Artificial Metalloenzymes by Active Learning\nAuthors: Vornholt, T.; Mutny, M.; Schmidt, G. W.; Schellhaas, C.; Tachibana, R.; Panke, S.; Ward, T. R.; Krause, A.; Jeschek, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579157\nTailored enzymes hold great potential to accelerate the transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. Yet, enzyme engineering remains challenging as it relies largely on serendipity and is, therefore, highly laborious and prone to failure. The efficiency and success rates of engineering campaigns may be improved substantially by applying machine learning to construct a comprehensive representation of the sequence-activity landscape from small sets of experimental data. However, it often proves challenging to reliably model a large protein sequence space while keeping the experimental effort tractable. To address this challenge, we present an integrated pipeline combining large-scale screening with active machine learning and model-guided library design. We applied this strategy to efficiently engineer an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) catalysing a new-to-nature hydroamination reaction. By combining lab automation and next-generation sequencing, we acquired sequence-activity data for several thousand ArM variants. We then used Gaussian process regression to model the activity landscape and guide further screening rounds according to user-defined objectives. Crucial characteristics of our enhanced enzyme engineering pipeline include i) the cost-effective generation of information-rich experimental data sets, ii) the integration of an explorative round to improve the performance of the model, as well as iii) the consideration of experimental noise during modelling. Our approach led to an order-of-magnitude boost in the hit rate of screening while making efficient use of experimental resources. Smart search strategies like this should find broad utility in enzyme engineering and accelerate the development of novel biocatalysts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The challenge of systematically modifying and optimizing regulatory elements for precise gene expression control is central to modern genomics and synthetic biology. Advancements in generative AI have paved the way for designing synthetic sequences with the aim of safely and accurately modulating gene expression. We leverage diffusion models to design context-specific DNA regulatory sequences, which hold significant potential toward enabling novel therapeutic applications requiring precise modulation of gene expression. Our framework uses a cell type-specific diffusion model to generate synthetic 200 bp regulatory elements based on chromatin accessibility across different cell types. We evaluate the generated sequences based on key metrics to ensure they retain properties of endogenous sequences: transcription factor binding site composition, potential for cell type-specific chromatin accessibility, and capacity for sequences generated by DNA diffusion to activate gene expression in different cell contexts using state-of-the-art prediction models. Our results demonstrate the ability to robustly generate DNA sequences with cell type-specific regulatory potential. DNA-Diffusion paves the way for revolutionizing a regulatory modulation approach to mammalian synthetic biology and precision gene therapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To realize the potential of genome editing for broad therapeutic applications, new tools are needed for delivery of multi-kilobase (kb) payloads at desired genomic sites with high precision. Here we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), an RNA-based genome editing system that merges CRISPR/Cas9 with the human L1 retrotransposon to insert gene-sized payloads without DNA donors or double strand breaks. CREATE enables L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration of an RNA-encoded payload gene specifically at two Cas9-induced nick sites. CREATE is delivered using mRNA components and achieves integration of &gt;1 kb payload in mammalian cells, opening the door to mRNA mediated therapeutic genome editing in vivo.

        <p class="abstract">Water contamination is a growing global concern, creating a need to develop technologies that can detect a range of target compounds at the required thresholds. Here, we address this need by merging biological allosteric transcription factors with DNA coated nanomechanical microcantilevers to detect chemicals in water with digital readout. After proof-of-concept demonstration and optimization to detect tetracycline with the TetR transcription factor, we use the CadC transcription factor to detect Pb2&#43; and Cd2&#43; in water at concentrations down to 2 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively, in less than fifteen minutes. A computational model suggests this improvement in sensitivity could be achieved by the DNA coated microcantilever surface changing transcription factor binding properties. Our findings demonstrate a promising new approach for water quality monitoring with fast, highly sensitive, digital readouts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The light-harvesting antenna complexes in cyanobacteria are known as phycobilisomes (PBSs), and they can adapt to a diverse range of light environments owing to the deployment of different phycobiliproteins within the PBS structures. Freshwater cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 thrive under red light due to phycocyanin (PC), along with phycocyanobilin (PCB), in PBS. Conversely, cyanobacteria in shorter-wavelength light environments, such as green light, employ phycoerythrin paired with phycoerythrobilin (PEB) alongside PC in PBS. Synthetic biology studies have shown that PEB production can be enhanced by additional expression of the heterologous PEB synthases, namely 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and PEB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebAB), leading to cellular browning due to PEB accumulation. This approach is genetically unstable, and the properties of the resulting PEB-bound PBS complexes remain uncharacterized. Herein, we engineered a novel strain of Synechococcus 7942 PEB1, with finely tuned control of PEB metabolism. PEB1 exhibited a remarkable and reversible color shift from green to brown and pink, based on the PebAB induction levels. High induction led to a complete PCB-to-PEB substitution, causing the disassembly of the PBS rod complex. In contrast, low PebAB levels resulted in the formation of a stable chimeric PBS complex with partial PCB-to-PEB substitution. This adaptation enabled efficient light harvesting in the green spectrum and energy transfer to the photosynthetic reaction center. These findings, which improve our understanding of PBS and highlight the structural importance of the bilin composition, lay the foundation for future PBS adaptation studies in bioengineering, synthetic biology, and renewable energy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tandem gene repeats naturally occur as important genomic features and determine many traits in living organisms, like human diseases and microbial productivities of target bioproducts. Here, we develop a bacterial type-II toxin-antitoxin-mediated method to manipulate genomic integration of tandem gene repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and further visualise the evolutionary trajectories of gene repeats. We designed a tri-vector system to introduce toxin-antitoxin-driven gene amplification (ToxAmp) modules, and accidentally re-visited the high-level capacity of multi-fragment co-transformation in S. cerevisiae. This system delivered the multi-copy gene integration in the form of tandem gene repeats spontaneously and independently from toxin-antitoxin-mediated selection. Inducing the toxin (RelE) expressing via a copper (II)-inducible CUP1 promoter successfully drove the in-situ gene amplification of the antitoxin (RelB) module, resulting in [~]40 copies of a green fluorescence reporter (GFP) gene per copy of genome. The copy-number changes, increasing and decreasing, and stable maintenance were visualised using the GFP and blue chromoprotein AeBlue as reporters. Copy-number increasing happened spontaneously not depending on a selection pressure and was quickly enriched through toxin-antitoxin-mediated selection. In summary, the bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems provide a flexible mechanism to manipulate gene copy number in eukaryotic cells and can be exploited for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications.

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, the fast-growing bacterium Vibrio natriegens has gained increasing attention as it has the potential to become a next-generation chassis for Synthetic Biology. A wide range of genetic parts and genome engineering methods have already been developed. However, there is still a need for a well-characterized tool to effectively and gradually reduce the expression level of native genes. To bridge this gap, we created graded-CRISPRi, a system utilizing gRNA variants that lead to varying levels of repression strength. By incorporating multiple gRNA sequences into our design, we successfully extended this concept to simultaneously repress four distinct reporter genes. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capability of using graded-CRISPRi to target native genes, thereby examining the effect of various knockdown levels on growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. We propose a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pre-training framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that 1) xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in 18 protein understanding benchmarks across four categories. The model also facilitates an atomic-resolution view of protein structures, leading to an advanced 3D structural prediction model that surpasses existing language model-based tools. 2) xTrimoPGLM not only can generate de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones, but also can perform programmable generation after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated sequences. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences, contributing to the evolving landscape of foundation models in protein science.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tailored enzymes hold great potential to accelerate the transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. Yet, enzyme engineering remains challenging as it relies largely on serendipity and is, therefore, highly laborious and prone to failure. The efficiency and success rates of engineering campaigns may be improved substantially by applying machine learning to construct a comprehensive representation of the sequence-activity landscape from small sets of experimental data. However, it often proves challenging to reliably model a large protein sequence space while keeping the experimental effort tractable. To address this challenge, we present an integrated pipeline combining large-scale screening with active machine learning and model-guided library design. We applied this strategy to efficiently engineer an artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) catalysing a new-to-nature hydroamination reaction. By combining lab automation and next-generation sequencing, we acquired sequence-activity data for several thousand ArM variants. We then used Gaussian process regression to model the activity landscape and guide further screening rounds according to user-defined objectives. Crucial characteristics of our enhanced enzyme engineering pipeline include i) the cost-effective generation of information-rich experimental data sets, ii) the integration of an explorative round to improve the performance of the model, as well as iii) the consideration of experimental noise during modelling. Our approach led to an order-of-magnitude boost in the hit rate of screening while making efficient use of experimental resources. Smart search strategies like this should find broad utility in enzyme engineering and accelerate the development of novel biocatalysts.</p>
