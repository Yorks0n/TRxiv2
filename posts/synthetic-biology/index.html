V.; Fabrini, G.; Di Michele, L.; Rothemund, P. W. K.; Franco, E.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561123\nRecent discoveries in biology have highlighted the importance of protein and RNA-based condensates as an alternative to classical membrane-bound organelles for the task of compartmentalizing molecules and biochemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate the rational design of pure RNA condensates from star-shaped RNA motifs. We generate condensates using two different RNA nanostar architectures: multi-stranded nanostars whose binding interactions are programmed via single-stranded overhangs, and single-stranded nanostars whose interactions are programmed via kissing loops. Through rational design of the nanostar interaction sequences, we demonstrate that both architectures can produce orthogonal (distinct and immiscible) condensates, which can be individually tracked via fluorogenic aptamers. We also show that aptamers make it possible to recruit peptides and proteins to the condensates with high specificity. Successful cotranscriptional formation of condensates from single-stranded nanostars suggests that they may be genetically encoded and produced in living cells. We provide a library of orthogonal RNA condensates that can be modularly customized and offer a route toward creating systems of functional artificial organelles.\nA Modular Design for Synthetic Membraneless Organelles Enables Compositional and Functional Control\nAuthors: Walls, M. T.; Xu, K.; Brangwynne, C. P.; Avalos, J. L.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560789\nLiving cells organize a wide variety of processes through compartmentalization into membraneless organelles, known as biomolecular condensates. Given their ubiquitous presence across a wide spectrum of different organisms and cell types, biomolecular condensates are increasingly considered to offer great potential for biotechnological applications. However, native condensates remain difficult to harness for engineering applications, both due to their intertwined mechanisms of assembly and compositional control, and potential disruptions to native cellular processes. Here, we demonstrate a modular framework for the formation of synthetic condensates designed to decouple cluster formation and protein recruitment. Synthetic condensates are built through constitutive oligomerization of intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs), which drive the formation of condensates whose composition can be independently defined through fused interaction domains. The composition of the proteins driven to partition into the condensate can be quantitatively described using a binding equilibrium model, demonstrating predictive control of how component expression levels and interaction affinity determine the degree of protein recruitment. Finally, the engineered system is utilized to regulate protein interactions and metabolic flux by harnessing the system's compositional tunability.\nProbiotic neoantigen delivery vectors for precision cancer immunotherapy\nAuthors: Redenti, A.; Im, J.; Redenti, B.; Li, F.; Rouanne, M.; Sheng, Z.; Sun, W.; Gurbatri, C.

With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home to tumors5-7 and modulate anti-tumor immunity8,9, one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines10-12. In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumor-specific neoantigen-derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective, and durable systemic anti-tumor immunity.\nBackbone extension acyl rearrangements enable cellular synthesis of proteins with internal β2-peptide linkages\nAuthors: Roe, L.; Schissel, C. K.; Dover, T. L.; Shah, B.; Hamlish, N. X.; Zheng, S.; Dilworth, D. A.; Wong, N.; Zhang, Z.; Chatterjee, A.; Francis, M. B.; Miller, S. J.; Schepartz, A.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560714\nProteins and polypeptides containing extended backbone monomers embody highly desirable structures and functions, but they cannot yet be biosynthesized in cells. There are two challenges at work. First is the ribosome, whose ability to promote rapid bond-forming reactions to and from anything other than an -amino acid or -hydroxy acid is unknown. The second challenge is the absence of orthogonal enzymes that acylate tRNA with extended backbone monomers. Here we describe a general approach to the programmed cellular synthesis of proteins containing extended backbone monomers that circumvents both of these challenges. Rather than relying on direct and uncharacterized reactions of non--amino acid monomers within the ribosomal PTC, we develop a proximity-guided intramolecular rearrangement that effectively edits the protein backbone post-translationally. The method relies on the ability of PylRS-like aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes to accept diverse -hydroxy acid monomers, including those whose side chains contain masked nucleophiles. Introduction of such an -hydroxy acid monomer into a protein translated in vivo, followed by nucleophile unmasking, sets up a thermodynamically favored and quantitative intramolecular Backbone Extension Acyl Rearrangement (BEAR) reaction that edits the protein backbone to install an extended backbone monomer. In the examples described here, the intramolecular rearrangement converts an -peptide backbone directly into a {beta}-backbone. As far as we know, this report represents the first example in which a much-desired expanded backbone {beta}-amino acid linkage has been introduced site selectively into a protein in a cell.\nCompact Programmable Control of Protein Secretion in Mammalian Cells\nAuthors: Vlahos, A. E.; Call, C. C.; Kadaba, S. E.; Guo, S.; Gao, X. J.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560774\nSynthetic biology currently holds immense potential to engineer the spatiotemporal control of intercellular signals for biomedicine. Programming behaviors using protein-based circuits has advantages over traditional gene circuits such as compact delivery and direct interactions with signaling proteins. Previously, we described a generalizable platform called RELEASE to enable the control of intercellular signaling through the proteolytic removal of ER-retention motifs compatible with pre-existing protease-based circuits. However, these tools lacked the ability to reliably program complex expression profiles and required numerous proteases, limiting delivery options. Here, we harness the recruitment and antagonistic behavior of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins to create RELEASE-NOT to turn off protein secretion in response to protease activity. By combining RELEASE and RELEASE-NOT, we establish a suite of protein-level processing and output modules called Compact RELEASE (compRELEASE). This innovation enables functions such as logic processing and analog signal filtering using a single input protease. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compactness of the post-translational design by using polycistronic single transcripts to engineer cells to control protein secretion via lentiviral integration and leverage mRNA delivery to selectively express cell surface proteins only in engineered cells harboring inducible proteases. CompRELEASE enables complex control of protein secretion and enhances the potential of synthetic protein circuits for therapeutic applications, while minimizing the overall genetic payload.\nCo-transcriptional production of programmable RNA condensates and synthetic organelles\nAuthors: Fabrini, G.; Nuccio, S. P.; Stewart, J. M.; Lin, S.; Tang, A.; Rothemund, P. W. K.; Franco, E.; Di Antonio, M.; Di Michele, L.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561174\nCondensation of RNA and proteins is central to cellular functions, and the ability to program it would be valuable in synthetic biology and synthetic cell science. Here we introduce a modular platform for engineering synthetic RNA condensates from tailor-made, branched RNA nanostructures that fold and assemble co-transcriptionally. Up to three orthogonal condensates can form simultaneously and selectively accumulate guest molecules. The RNA condensates can be expressed within synthetic cells to produce membrane-less organelles with controlled number, size, morphology and compositions, and that display the ability to selectively capture proteins. The in situ expression of programmable RNA condensates could underpin spatial organisation of functionalities in both biological and synthetic cells.\nEngineered bacteria launch and control an oncolytic virus\nAuthors: Singer, Z.

Here we design a cooperative strategy whereby S. typhimurium bacteria transcribe and deliver the Senecavirus A RNA genome inside host cells, launching a potent oncolytic viral infection. Then, we engineer the virus to require a bacterially delivered protease in order to achieve virion maturation, demonstrating bacterial control over the virus. This work extends bacterially delivered therapeutics to viral genomes, and the governing of a viral population through engineered microbial interactions. One-Sentence SummaryBacteria are engineered to act as a synthetic \"capsid\" delivering Senecavirus A genome and controlling its spread.\nOptoProfilin: A Single Component Biosensor of Applied Cellular Stress\nAuthors: Mann, N.; Hill, J. T.; Wang, K.; Hughes, R. M.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560945\nThe actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as cofilin-actin rods and stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and ALS. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, neurodegenerative disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (OptoProfilin) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.\nDesigned Endocytosis-Triggering Proteins mediate Targeted Degradation and amplify signaling\nAuthors: Huang, B.; Abedi, M.; Ahn, G.; Coventry, B.; Sappington, I.; Wang, R.; Schlichthaerle, T.; Zhang, J.

L.; Roybal, K. T.; Greisen, P.; Li, X.; Bertozzi, C.; Baker, D.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.19.553321\nEndocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by interaction with endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as LYTAC1,2 and KineTAC3, have taken advantage of this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. While powerful, these approaches can be limited by possible competition with the endogenous ligand(s), the requirement in some cases for chemical modification that limits genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and more generally, there may not be natural ligands which stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe general protein design approaches for designing endocytosis triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for the IGF-2R, ASGPR, Sortillin, and Transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to proteins which bind to soluble or transmembrane protein leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation; as these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. The tunability and modularity of our genetically encodable EndoTags should contribute to deciphering the relationship between receptor engagement and cellular trafficking, and they have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signaling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody drug and RNA conjugates.\nProgramming dynamic division of labor using horizontal gene transfer\nAuthors: Hamrick, G. S.; Maddamsetti, R.; Son, H.-I.; Wilson, M. L.; Davis, H. M.; You, L.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560696\nThe metabolic engineering of microbes has broad applications, including in biomanufacturing, bioprocessing, and environmental remediation. The introduction of a complex, multi-step pathway often imposes a substantial metabolic burden on the host cell, restraining the accumulation of productive biomass and limiting pathway efficiency. One strategy to alleviate metabolic burden is division of labor (DOL), in which different subpopulations carry out different parts of the pathway and work together to convert a substrate into a final product. However, the maintenance of different engineered subpopulations is challenging due to competition and convoluted inter-strain population dynamics. Through modeling, we show that dynamic division of labor (DDOL) mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can overcome these limitations and enable the robust maintenance of burdensome, multi-step pathways. We also use plasmid genomics to uncover evidence that DDOL is a strategy utilized by natural microbial communities. Our work suggests that bioengineers can harness HGT to stabilize synthetic metabolic pathways in microbial communities, enabling the development of robust engineered systems for deployment in a variety of contexts.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent discoveries in biology have highlighted the importance of protein and RNA-based condensates as an alternative to classical membrane-bound organelles for the task of compartmentalizing molecules and biochemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate the rational design of pure RNA condensates from star-shaped RNA motifs. We generate condensates using two different RNA nanostar architectures: multi-stranded nanostars whose binding interactions are programmed via single-stranded overhangs, and single-stranded nanostars whose interactions are programmed via kissing loops. Through rational design of the nanostar interaction sequences, we demonstrate that both architectures can produce orthogonal (distinct and immiscible) condensates, which can be individually tracked via fluorogenic aptamers. We also show that aptamers make it possible to recruit peptides and proteins to the condensates with high specificity. Successful cotranscriptional formation of condensates from single-stranded nanostars suggests that they may be genetically encoded and produced in living cells. We provide a library of orthogonal RNA condensates that can be modularly customized and offer a route toward creating systems of functional artificial organelles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Living cells organize a wide variety of processes through compartmentalization into membraneless organelles, known as biomolecular condensates. Given their ubiquitous presence across a wide spectrum of different organisms and cell types, biomolecular condensates are increasingly considered to offer great potential for biotechnological applications. However, native condensates remain difficult to harness for engineering applications, both due to their intertwined mechanisms of assembly and compositional control, and potential disruptions to native cellular processes. Here, we demonstrate a modular framework for the formation of synthetic condensates designed to decouple cluster formation and protein recruitment. Synthetic condensates are built through constitutive oligomerization of intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs), which drive the formation of condensates whose composition can be independently defined through fused interaction domains. The composition of the proteins driven to partition into the condensate can be quantitatively described using a binding equilibrium model, demonstrating predictive control of how component expression levels and interaction affinity determine the degree of protein recruitment. Finally, the engineered system is utilized to regulate protein interactions and metabolic flux by harnessing the system&#39;s compositional tunability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial systems have been synthetically engineered to deploy therapeutic payloads in vivo1-4. With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home to tumors5-7 and modulate anti-tumor immunity8,9, one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines10-12. In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumor-specific neoantigen-derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective, and durable systemic anti-tumor immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Proteins and polypeptides containing extended backbone monomers embody highly desirable structures and functions, but they cannot yet be biosynthesized in cells. There are two challenges at work. First is the ribosome, whose ability to promote rapid bond-forming reactions to and from anything other than an -amino acid or -hydroxy acid is unknown. The second challenge is the absence of orthogonal enzymes that acylate tRNA with extended backbone monomers. Here we describe a general approach to the programmed cellular synthesis of proteins containing extended backbone monomers that circumvents both of these challenges. Rather than relying on direct and uncharacterized reactions of non--amino acid monomers within the ribosomal PTC, we develop a proximity-guided intramolecular rearrangement that effectively edits the protein backbone post-translationally. The method relies on the ability of PylRS-like aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes to accept diverse -hydroxy acid monomers, including those whose side chains contain masked nucleophiles. Introduction of such an -hydroxy acid monomer into a protein translated in vivo, followed by nucleophile unmasking, sets up a thermodynamically favored and quantitative intramolecular Backbone Extension Acyl Rearrangement (BEAR) reaction that edits the protein backbone to install an extended backbone monomer. In the examples described here, the intramolecular rearrangement converts an -peptide backbone directly into a {beta}-backbone. As far as we know, this report represents the first example in which a much-desired expanded backbone {beta}-amino acid linkage has been introduced site selectively into a protein in a cell.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic biology currently holds immense potential to engineer the spatiotemporal control of intercellular signals for biomedicine. Programming behaviors using protein-based circuits has advantages over traditional gene circuits such as compact delivery and direct interactions with signaling proteins. Previously, we described a generalizable platform called RELEASE to enable the control of intercellular signaling through the proteolytic removal of ER-retention motifs compatible with pre-existing protease-based circuits. However, these tools lacked the ability to reliably program complex expression profiles and required numerous proteases, limiting delivery options. Here, we harness the recruitment and antagonistic behavior of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins to create RELEASE-NOT to turn off protein secretion in response to protease activity. By combining RELEASE and RELEASE-NOT, we establish a suite of protein-level processing and output modules called Compact RELEASE (compRELEASE). This innovation enables functions such as logic processing and analog signal filtering using a single input protease. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compactness of the post-translational design by using polycistronic single transcripts to engineer cells to control protein secretion via lentiviral integration and leverage mRNA delivery to selectively express cell surface proteins only in engineered cells harboring inducible proteases. CompRELEASE enables complex control of protein secretion and enhances the potential of synthetic protein circuits for therapeutic applications, while minimizing the overall genetic payload.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Condensation of RNA and proteins is central to cellular functions, and the ability to program it would be valuable in synthetic biology and synthetic cell science. Here we introduce a modular platform for engineering synthetic RNA condensates from tailor-made, branched RNA nanostructures that fold and assemble co-transcriptionally. Up to three orthogonal condensates can form simultaneously and selectively accumulate guest molecules. The RNA condensates can be expressed within synthetic cells to produce membrane-less organelles with controlled number, size, morphology and compositions, and that display the ability to selectively capture proteins. The in situ expression of programmable RNA condensates could underpin spatial organisation of functionalities in both biological and synthetic cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of bacteria and viruses to selectively replicate in tumors has led to synthetic engineering of new microbial therapies. Here we design a cooperative strategy whereby S. typhimurium bacteria transcribe and deliver the Senecavirus A RNA genome inside host cells, launching a potent oncolytic viral infection. Then, we engineer the virus to require a bacterially delivered protease in order to achieve virion maturation, demonstrating bacterial control over the virus. This work extends bacterially delivered therapeutics to viral genomes, and the governing of a viral population through engineered microbial interactions.

        <p class="abstract">The actin cytoskeleton is a biosensor of cellular stress and a potential prognosticator of human disease. In particular, aberrant cytoskeletal structures such as cofilin-actin rods and stress granules formed in response to energetic and oxidative stress are closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and ALS. Whether these cytoskeletal phenomena can be harnessed for the development of biosensors for cytoskeletal dysfunction and, by extension, neurodegenerative disease progression, remains an open question. In this work, we describe the design and development of an optogenetic iteration of profilin, an actin monomer binding protein with critical functions in cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that this optically activated profilin (OptoProfilin) can act as an optically triggered biosensor of applied cellular stress in select immortalized cell lines. Notably, OptoProfilin is a single component biosensor, likely increasing its utility for experimentalists. While a large body of work closely links profilin activity with cellular stress and neurodegenerative disease, this, to our knowledge, is the first example of profilin as an optogenetic biosensor of stress-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by interaction with endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as LYTAC1,2 and KineTAC3, have taken advantage of this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. While powerful, these approaches can be limited by possible competition with the endogenous ligand(s), the requirement in some cases for chemical modification that limits genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and more generally, there may not be natural ligands which stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe general protein design approaches for designing endocytosis triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for the IGF-2R, ASGPR, Sortillin, and Transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to proteins which bind to soluble or transmembrane protein leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation; as these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. The tunability and modularity of our genetically encodable EndoTags should contribute to deciphering the relationship between receptor engagement and cellular trafficking, and they have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signaling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody drug and RNA conjugates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The metabolic engineering of microbes has broad applications, including in biomanufacturing, bioprocessing, and environmental remediation. The introduction of a complex, multi-step pathway often imposes a substantial metabolic burden on the host cell, restraining the accumulation of productive biomass and limiting pathway efficiency. One strategy to alleviate metabolic burden is division of labor (DOL), in which different subpopulations carry out different parts of the pathway and work together to convert a substrate into a final product. However, the maintenance of different engineered subpopulations is challenging due to competition and convoluted inter-strain population dynamics. Through modeling, we show that dynamic division of labor (DDOL) mediated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can overcome these limitations and enable the robust maintenance of burdensome, multi-step pathways. We also use plasmid genomics to uncover evidence that DDOL is a strategy utilized by natural microbial communities. Our work suggests that bioengineers can harness HGT to stabilize synthetic metabolic pathways in microbial communities, enabling the development of robust engineered systems for deployment in a variety of contexts.</p>
