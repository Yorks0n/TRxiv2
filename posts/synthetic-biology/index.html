B.; Alcalay, Y.; Zecharia, C.; Krsticevic, F.; Yonah, E. S.; Avraham, R. D.; Windbichler, N.; Papathanos, P. A.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554004\nEngineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of both self-limiting and self-sustaining genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pest or disease vector populations such as malaria mosquitoes. Two different CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms, X-shredding which eliminates X-bearing sperm in males and X-poisoning which causes postzygotic mortality of daughters inheriting disrupted X-linked genes, have been proposed. The nature of the sex distortion mechanism is predicted to affect the population dynamics of released Y-chromosome SRDs: A Y-linked X-shredder is invasive constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas Y-linked X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection and disappearance. Here, we established the first X-poisoning SRD system in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae targeting three X-linked ribosomal protein (RP) genes during spermatogenesis. Surprisingly, when we characterized transgenic strains showing a significant male bias, we found that sex distortion was primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of daughters. By leveraging the Drosophila model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explored premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs, once trade-offs between sex chromosome transmission distortion and male fertility are functionally balanced.\nDesigned Endocytosis-Triggering Proteins mediate Targeted Degradation and amplify signaling\nAuthors: Huang, B.; Abedi, M.; Ahn, G.; Coventry, B.; Sappington, I.; Wang, R.; Schlichthaerle, T.; Zhang, J. Z.; Wang, Y.; Goreshnik, I.; Chiu, C. W.; Chazin-Gray, A.; Chan, S.; Gerben, S.; Murray, A.; Wang, S.; O'Neill, J.; Yeh, R.; Misquith, A.; Wolf, A.; Tomasovic, L. M.; Piraner, D. I.; Gonzalez, M. J.

Therapeutic approaches such as LYTAC1,2 and KineTAC3, have taken advantage of this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. While powerful, these approaches can be limited by possible competition with the endogenous ligand(s), the requirement in some cases for chemical modification that limits genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and more generally, there may not be natural ligands which stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe general protein design approaches for designing endocytosis triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for the IGF-2R, ASGPR, and Transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to proteins which bind to soluble or transmembrane protein leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation; as these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. The tunability and modularity of our genetically encodable EndoTags should contribute to deciphering the relationship between receptor engagement and cellular trafficking, and they have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signaling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody drug and RNA conjugates.\nRationally seeded computational protein design\nAuthors: Albanese, K. I.; Petrenas, R.; Pirro, F.; Naudin, E. A.; Borucu, U.; Dawson, W. M.; Scott, D. A.; Leggett, G. J.; Weiner, O. D.; Oliver, T.; Woolfson, D.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-08-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554789\nComputational protein design is advancing rapidly. Here we describe efficient routes to two families of a-helical-barrel proteins with central channels that bind small molecules. The designs are seeded by the sequences and structures of defined de novo oligomeric barrel-forming peptides. Adjacent helices are connected using computational loop building. For targets with antiparallel helices, short loops are sufficient. However, targets with parallel helices require longer connectors; namely, an outer layer of helix-turn-helix-turn-helix motifs that are packed onto the barrels computationally. Throughout these pipelines, residues that define open states of the barrels are maintained. This minimises sequence sampling and accelerates routes to successful designs. For each of 6 targets, just 2-6 synthetic genes are made for expression in E. coli. On average, 80% express to give soluble monomeric proteins that are characterized fully, including high-resolution structures for most targets that match the seed structures and design models with high accuracy.\nOne-pot chemo-enzymatic synthesis and one-step recovery of homogeneous long-chain polyphosphates from microalgal biomass\nAuthors: Lin, Y.-H.; Nishikawa, S.; Jia, T.

Despite some chemical-based methods, biological phosphorus removal using polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, such as microalgae, serves as a sustainable alternative to reclaim phosphate from wastewater. Polyphosphates have profound biological functions and biomedical applications, serving as energy stock, coagulation factors, and antiviral agents depending on their length, showing inherent value in polyphosphate recovery. Here, we leveraged the power of thermodynamic coupling and phase transitions to establish a one-pot, two-step multi-enzyme cascade to convert polydisperse polyphosphate in microalgae biomass into high-molecular-weight insoluble long-chain polyphosphates, allowing for one-step purification. We then optimzed a thermo-digestion approach to transform the 1,300-mers into shorter polyphosphates. Altogether, the processes established here enable the establishment of a sustainable P bioeconomy platform to refine microalgal biomass for biotechnological uses.\nAromatic natural products synthesis from aromatic lignin monomers using Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1\nAuthors: Biggs, B. W.; Tyo, K. E. J.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.24.554694\nAchieving sustainable chemical synthesis and a circular economy will require process innovation to minimize or recover existing waste streams. Valorization of lignin biomass has the ability to advance this goal. While lignin has proved a recalcitrant feedstock for upgrading, biological approaches can leverage native microbial metabolism to simplify complex and heterogeneous feedstocks to tractable starting points for biochemical upgrading. Recently, we demonstrated that one microbe with lignin relevant metabolism, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, is both highly engineerable and capable of undergoing rapid design-build-test-learn cycles, making it an ideal candidate for these applications. Here, we utilize these genetic traits and native {beta}-ketoadipate metabolism to convert mock alkali pretreated liquor lignin (APL) to two valuable natural products, vanillin-glucoside and resveratrol. En route, we create strains with up to 22 genetic modifications, including up to 8 heterologously expressed enzymes. Our approach takes advantage of preexisting aromatic species in APL (vanillate, ferulate, and p-coumarate) to create shortened biochemical routes to end products. Together, this work demonstrates the potential of ADP1 as a platform for upgrading lignin waste streams and highlights the potential for biosynthetic methods to maximize the existing chemical potential of lignin aromatic monomers.\nGene drive and genetic sex conversion in the global agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata\nAuthors: Meccariello, A.; Hou, S.; Davydova, S.; Fawcett, J.; Siddall, A.; Leftwich, P. T.; Krsticevic, F.; Papathanos, P. A.; Windbichler, N.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553191\nHoming-based gene drives are novel interventions promising the area-wide, species-specific genetic control of harmful insect populations. Here we characterise a first set of gene drives in a tephritid agricultural pest species, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). Our results show that the medfly is highly amenable to homing-based gene drive strategies. By targeting the medfly transformer gene, we also demonstrate two different mechanisms by which CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive can be coupled to sex conversion, whereby genetic females are transformed into fertile and harmless XX males. Given this unique malleability of sex determination, we modelled gene drive interventions that couple sex conversion and female sterility and found that such approaches could be effective and tolerant of resistant allele selection in the target population. Our results open the door for developing gene drive strains for the population suppression of the medfly and related tephritid pests by co-targeting female reproduction and shifting the reproductive sex ratio towards males. They demonstrate the untapped potential for gene drives to tackle agricultural pests in an environmentally friendly and economical way.\nCell-Free Protein Expression in Polymer Materials\nAuthors: Lee, M. F. S.; Lee, J. A.; Biondo, J. R.; Lux, J. E.; Raig, R. M.; Berger, P. N.; Bernhards, C. B.; Kuhn, D. L.; Gupta, M. K.; Lux, M. W.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553881\nWhile synthetic biology has advanced complex capabilities like sensing and molecule synthesis in aqueous solutions, important applications may also be pursued for biological systems in solid materials. Harsh processing conditions used to produce many synthetic materials such as plastics makes incorporation of biological functionality challenging. One technology that shows promise in circumventing these issues is cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), where core cellular functionality is reconstituted outside the cell. CFPS enables genetic functions to be implemented without the complications of membrane transport or concerns over cellular viability or release of genetically modified organisms. Here we demonstrate that dried CFPS reactions have remarkable tolerance to heat and organic solvent exposure during the casting processes for polymer materials. We demonstrate the utility of this observation by creating plastics that have spatially patterned genetic functionality, produce antimicrobials in situ, and perform sensing reactions. The resulting materials unlock the potential to deliver DNA-programmable bio-functionality in a ubiquitous class of synthetic materials.\nCell free expression in proteinosomes prepared from native protein-PNIPAAm conjugates\nAuthors: Gao, M.; Wang, D.; Wilsch-Brauninger, M.; Leng, W.; Schulte, J.; Morgner, N.; Appelhans, D.; Tang, T.-Y. D.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554401\nTowards the goal of building synthetic cells from the bottom-up, the establishment of micrometer-sized compartments that contain and support cell free transcription and translation that couple cellular structure to function is of critical importance. Proteinosomes, formed from crosslinked cationized protein-polymer conjugates offer a promising solution to membrane-bound compartmentalisation with an open, semi-permeable membrane. Critically, to date, there have been no demonstration of cell free transcription and translation within water-in-water proteinosomes. Herein, we present a novel approach to the fabrication of proteinosomes directly from native protein-polymer (BSA-PNIPAAm) conjugates. We show that these native proteinosomes offer an excellent alternative as artificial cell chassis. Significantly, the native proteinosomes are stable under high salt conditions and can consequently support cell free transcription and translation. The native proteinosomes offer enhanced protein expression compared to proteinosomes prepared from traditional methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of proteinosomes into higher order cellular architectures with membrane free compartments and liposomes. The integration of bioinspired architectural elements with the central dogma is an essential building block for realizing minimal synthetic cells and is key for exploiting artificial cells in real-world applications.\nMachine-guided design of synthetic cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements\nAuthors: Gosai, S.

K.; Tewhey, R.\nScore: 61.9, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552077\nCis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing, and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.\nEfficient Natural Plasmid Transformation of Vibrio natriegens Enables Zero-capital Molecular Biology\nAuthors: Specht, D. A.; Sheppard, T. J.; Kennedy, F.; Li, S.; Gadikota, G.; Barstow, B.\nScore: 39.8, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553013\nThe fast-growing microbe Vibrio natriegens is capable of natural transformation where it draws DNA in from media via an active process under physiological conditions. Using an engineered strain with a genomic copy of the master competence regulator tfoX from Vibrio cholera in combination with a new minimal competence media (MCM) that uses acetate as an energy source, we demonstrate naturally competent cells which are created, transformed, and recovered entirely in the same media, without exchange or addition of new media. Cells are naturally competent to plasmids, recombination with linear DNA, and co-transformation of both to select for scarless and markerless genomic edits. The entire process is simple and inexpensive, requiring no capital equipment for an entirely room temperature process (Zero Capital protocol, 104 cfu/{micro}g), or just an incubator (High Efficiency protocol, 105-6 cfu/{micro}g). These cells retain their naturally competent state when frozen and are transformable immediately upon thawing like a typical chemical or electrochemical competent cell. Since the optimized transformation protocol requires only 50 minutes of hands-on time, and V. natriegens grows quickly even on plates, a transformation started at 9 AM yields abundant culturable single colonies by 5 PM. Further, because all stages of transformation occur in the same media, and the process can be arbitrarily scaled in volume, this natural competence strain and media could be ideal for automated directed evolution applications. As a result, naturally competent V. natriegens could compete with E. coli as an excellent chassis for low-cost and highly scalable synthetic biology.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Engineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of both self-limiting and self-sustaining genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pest or disease vector populations such as malaria mosquitoes. Two different CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms, X-shredding which eliminates X-bearing sperm in males and X-poisoning which causes postzygotic mortality of daughters inheriting disrupted X-linked genes, have been proposed. The nature of the sex distortion mechanism is predicted to affect the population dynamics of released Y-chromosome SRDs: A Y-linked X-shredder is invasive constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas Y-linked X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection and disappearance. Here, we established the first X-poisoning SRD system in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae targeting three X-linked ribosomal protein (RP) genes during spermatogenesis. Surprisingly, when we characterized transgenic strains showing a significant male bias, we found that sex distortion was primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of daughters. By leveraging the Drosophila model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explored premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs, once trade-offs between sex chromosome transmission distortion and male fertility are functionally balanced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of cell surface receptors can be triggered by interaction with endogenous ligands. Therapeutic approaches such as LYTAC1,2 and KineTAC3, have taken advantage of this to target specific proteins for degradation by fusing modified native ligands to target binding proteins. While powerful, these approaches can be limited by possible competition with the endogenous ligand(s), the requirement in some cases for chemical modification that limits genetic encodability and can complicate manufacturing, and more generally, there may not be natural ligands which stimulate endocytosis through a given receptor. Here we describe general protein design approaches for designing endocytosis triggering binding proteins (EndoTags) that overcome these challenges. We present EndoTags for the IGF-2R, ASGPR, and Transferrin receptors, and show that fusing these tags to proteins which bind to soluble or transmembrane protein leads to lysosomal trafficking and target degradation; as these receptors have different tissue distributions, the different EndoTags could enable targeting of degradation to different tissues. The modularity and genetic encodability of EndoTags enables AND gate control for higher specificity targeted degradation, and the localized secretion of degraders from engineered cells. The tunability and modularity of our genetically encodable EndoTags should contribute to deciphering the relationship between receptor engagement and cellular trafficking, and they have considerable therapeutic potential as targeted degradation inducers, signaling activators for endocytosis-dependent pathways, and cellular uptake inducers for targeted antibody drug and RNA conjugates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computational protein design is advancing rapidly. Here we describe efficient routes to two families of a-helical-barrel proteins with central channels that bind small molecules. The designs are seeded by the sequences and structures of defined de novo oligomeric barrel-forming peptides. Adjacent helices are connected using computational loop building. For targets with antiparallel helices, short loops are sufficient. However, targets with parallel helices require longer connectors; namely, an outer layer of helix-turn-helix-turn-helix motifs that are packed onto the barrels computationally. Throughout these pipelines, residues that define open states of the barrels are maintained. This minimises sequence sampling and accelerates routes to successful designs. For each of 6 targets, just 2-6 synthetic genes are made for expression in E. coli. On average, 80% express to give soluble monomeric proteins that are characterized fully, including high-resolution structures for most targets that match the seed structures and design models with high accuracy.</p>

Despite some chemical-based methods, biological phosphorus removal using polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, such as microalgae, serves as a sustainable alternative to reclaim phosphate from wastewater. Polyphosphates have profound biological functions and biomedical applications, serving as energy stock, coagulation factors, and antiviral agents depending on their length, showing inherent value in polyphosphate recovery. Here, we leveraged the power of thermodynamic coupling and phase transitions to establish a one-pot, two-step multi-enzyme cascade to convert polydisperse polyphosphate in microalgae biomass into high-molecular-weight insoluble long-chain polyphosphates, allowing for one-step purification. We then optimzed a thermo-digestion approach to transform the 1,300-mers into shorter polyphosphates. Altogether, the processes established here enable the establishment of a sustainable P bioeconomy platform to refine microalgal biomass for biotechnological uses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Achieving sustainable chemical synthesis and a circular economy will require process innovation to minimize or recover existing waste streams. Valorization of lignin biomass has the ability to advance this goal. While lignin has proved a recalcitrant feedstock for upgrading, biological approaches can leverage native microbial metabolism to simplify complex and heterogeneous feedstocks to tractable starting points for biochemical upgrading. Recently, we demonstrated that one microbe with lignin relevant metabolism, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, is both highly engineerable and capable of undergoing rapid design-build-test-learn cycles, making it an ideal candidate for these applications. Here, we utilize these genetic traits and native {beta}-ketoadipate metabolism to convert mock alkali pretreated liquor lignin (APL) to two valuable natural products, vanillin-glucoside and resveratrol. En route, we create strains with up to 22 genetic modifications, including up to 8 heterologously expressed enzymes. Our approach takes advantage of preexisting aromatic species in APL (vanillate, ferulate, and p-coumarate) to create shortened biochemical routes to end products. Together, this work demonstrates the potential of ADP1 as a platform for upgrading lignin waste streams and highlights the potential for biosynthetic methods to maximize the existing chemical potential of lignin aromatic monomers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Homing-based gene drives are novel interventions promising the area-wide, species-specific genetic control of harmful insect populations. Here we characterise a first set of gene drives in a tephritid agricultural pest species, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). Our results show that the medfly is highly amenable to homing-based gene drive strategies. By targeting the medfly transformer gene, we also demonstrate two different mechanisms by which CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive can be coupled to sex conversion, whereby genetic females are transformed into fertile and harmless XX males. Given this unique malleability of sex determination, we modelled gene drive interventions that couple sex conversion and female sterility and found that such approaches could be effective and tolerant of resistant allele selection in the target population. Our results open the door for developing gene drive strains for the population suppression of the medfly and related tephritid pests by co-targeting female reproduction and shifting the reproductive sex ratio towards males. They demonstrate the untapped potential for gene drives to tackle agricultural pests in an environmentally friendly and economical way.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While synthetic biology has advanced complex capabilities like sensing and molecule synthesis in aqueous solutions, important applications may also be pursued for biological systems in solid materials. Harsh processing conditions used to produce many synthetic materials such as plastics makes incorporation of biological functionality challenging. One technology that shows promise in circumventing these issues is cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), where core cellular functionality is reconstituted outside the cell. CFPS enables genetic functions to be implemented without the complications of membrane transport or concerns over cellular viability or release of genetically modified organisms. Here we demonstrate that dried CFPS reactions have remarkable tolerance to heat and organic solvent exposure during the casting processes for polymer materials. We demonstrate the utility of this observation by creating plastics that have spatially patterned genetic functionality, produce antimicrobials in situ, and perform sensing reactions. The resulting materials unlock the potential to deliver DNA-programmable bio-functionality in a ubiquitous class of synthetic materials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Towards the goal of building synthetic cells from the bottom-up, the establishment of micrometer-sized compartments that contain and support cell free transcription and translation that couple cellular structure to function is of critical importance. Proteinosomes, formed from crosslinked cationized protein-polymer conjugates offer a promising solution to membrane-bound compartmentalisation with an open, semi-permeable membrane. Critically, to date, there have been no demonstration of cell free transcription and translation within water-in-water proteinosomes. Herein, we present a novel approach to the fabrication of proteinosomes directly from native protein-polymer (BSA-PNIPAAm) conjugates. We show that these native proteinosomes offer an excellent alternative as artificial cell chassis. Significantly, the native proteinosomes are stable under high salt conditions and can consequently support cell free transcription and translation. The native proteinosomes offer enhanced protein expression compared to proteinosomes prepared from traditional methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of proteinosomes into higher order cellular architectures with membrane free compartments and liposomes. The integration of bioinspired architectural elements with the central dogma is an essential building block for realizing minimal synthetic cells and is key for exploiting artificial cells in real-world applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing, and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fast-growing microbe Vibrio natriegens is capable of natural transformation where it draws DNA in from media via an active process under physiological conditions. Using an engineered strain with a genomic copy of the master competence regulator tfoX from Vibrio cholera in combination with a new minimal competence media (MCM) that uses acetate as an energy source, we demonstrate naturally competent cells which are created, transformed, and recovered entirely in the same media, without exchange or addition of new media. Cells are naturally competent to plasmids, recombination with linear DNA, and co-transformation of both to select for scarless and markerless genomic edits. The entire process is simple and inexpensive, requiring no capital equipment for an entirely room temperature process (Zero Capital protocol, 104 cfu/{micro}g), or just an incubator (High Efficiency protocol, 105-6 cfu/{micro}g). These cells retain their naturally competent state when frozen and are transformable immediately upon thawing like a typical chemical or electrochemical competent cell. Since the optimized transformation protocol requires only 50 minutes of hands-on time, and V. natriegens grows quickly even on plates, a transformation started at 9 AM yields abundant culturable single colonies by 5 PM. Further, because all stages of transformation occur in the same media, and the process can be arbitrarily scaled in volume, this natural competence strain and media could be ideal for automated directed evolution applications. As a result, naturally competent V. natriegens could compete with E. coli as an excellent chassis for low-cost and highly scalable synthetic biology.</p>
