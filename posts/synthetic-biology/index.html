Using an engineered strain with a genomic copy of the master competence regulator tfoX from Vibrio cholera in combination with a new minimal competence media (MCM) that uses acetate as an energy source, we demonstrate naturally competent cells which are created, transformed, and recovered entirely in the same media, without exchange or addition of new media. Cells are naturally competent to plasmids, recombination with linear DNA, and co-transformation of both to select for scarless and markerless genomic edits. The entire process is simple and inexpensive, requiring no capital equipment for an entirely room temperature process (Zero Capital protocol, 104 cfu/{micro}g), or just an incubator (High Efficiency protocol, 105-6 cfu/{micro}g). These cells retain their naturally competent state when frozen and are transformable immediately upon thawing like a typical chemical or electrochemical competent cell. Since the optimized transformation protocol requires only 50 minutes of hands-on time, and V. natriegens grows quickly even on plates, a transformation started at 9 AM yields abundant culturable single colonies by 5 PM. Further, because all stages of transformation occur in the same media, and the process can be arbitrarily scaled in volume, this natural competence strain and media could be ideal for automated directed evolution applications. As a result, naturally competent V. natriegens could compete with E. coli as an excellent chassis for low-cost and highly scalable synthetic biology.\nA molecular proximity sensor based on an engineered, dual-component guide RNA\nAuthors: Choi, J.; Chen, W.; Liao, H.; Li, X.; Shendure, J.\nScore: 36.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553235\nOne of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.\nMachine-guided design of synthetic cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements\nAuthors: Gosai, S. J.; Castro, R. I.; Fuentes, N.; Butts, J. C.; Kales, S.; Noche, R. R.; Mouri, K.; Sabeti, P. C.; Reilly, S. K.; Tewhey, R.\nScore: 59.3, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552077\nCis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing, and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.\nGene drive and genetic sex conversion in the global agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata\nAuthors: Meccariello, A.; Hou, S.; Davydova, S.; Fawcett, J.; Siddall, A.; Leftwich, P. T.; Krsticevic, F.; Papathanos, P. A.; Windbichler, N.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553191\nHoming-based gene drives are novel interventions promising the area-wide, species-specific genetic control of harmful insect populations. Here we characterise a first set of gene drives in a tephritid agricultural pest species, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). Our results show that the medfly is highly amenable to homing-based gene drive strategies. By targeting the medfly transformer gene, we also demonstrate two different mechanisms by which CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive can be coupled to sex conversion, whereby genetic females are transformed into fertile and harmless XX males. Given this unique malleability of sex determination, we modelled gene drive interventions that couple sex conversion and female sterility and found that such approaches could be effective and tolerant of resistant allele selection in the target population. Our results open the door for developing gene drive strains for the population suppression of the medfly and related tephritid pests by co-targeting female reproduction and shifting the reproductive sex ratio towards males. They demonstrate the untapped potential for gene drives to tackle agricultural pests in an environmentally friendly and economical way.\nA chemical reaction network model of PURE\nAuthors: Jurado, Z.; Pandey, A.; Murray, R. M.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553301\nCell-free expression systems provide a method for rapid DNA circuit prototyping and functional protein synthesis. While crude extracts remain a black box with many components carrying out unknown reactions, the PURE system contains only the required transcription and translation components for protein production. All proteins and small molecules are at known concentrations, opening up the possibility of detailed modeling for reliable computational predictions. However, there is little to no experimental data supporting the expression of target proteins for detailed protein models PURE models. In this work, we build a chemical reaction network transcription model for PURE protein synthesis. We compare the transcription models using DNA encoding for the malachite-green aptamer (MGapt) to measure mRNA production. Furthermore, we expand the PURE detailed translation model for an arbitrary set of amino acids and length. Lastly, we combine the transcription and the expanded translation models to create a PURE protein synthesis model built purely from mass-action reactions. We use the combined model to capture the translation of a plasmid encoding MGapt and deGFP under a T7-promoter and a strong RBS. The model accurately predicts the MGapt mRNA production for the first two hours, the dynamics of deGFP expression, and the total protein production with an accuracy within 10 %.\nManipulating the 3D organization of the largest synthetic yeast chromosome\nAuthors: Zhang, W.; Stefanita, L.

Here we report de novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome thus far, synIV, a 1,454,621-bp Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome resulting from extensive genome streamlining and modification. During the construction of synIV, we developed megachunk assembly combined with a hierarchical integration strategy, which significantly increased the accuracy and flexibility of synthetic chromosome construction and facilitated chromosome debugging. In addition to the drastic sequence changes made to synIV by rewriting it, we further manipulated the three-dimensional structure of synIV in the yeast nucleus to explore spatial gene regulation within the nuclear space. Surprisingly, we found few gene expression changes, suggesting that positioning inside the yeast nucleoplasm plays a minor role in gene regulation. Lastly, we tethered synIV to the inner nuclear membrane via its hundreds of loxPsym sites and observed transcriptional repression of the entire chromosome, demonstrating chromosome-wide transcription manipulation without changing the DNA sequences. Our manipulation of the spatial structure of the largest synthetic yeast chromosome shed light on higher-order architectural design of the synthetic genomes.

W.; Leichthammer, C. D.; Saita, I. M.; Lukas, N. D.; Batko, I. Z.; Heinrichs, D. E.; Edgell, D.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553307\nLimiting the spread of synthetic genetic information outside of the intended use is essential for applications where biocontainment is critical. In particular, biocontainment of engineered probiotics and plasmids that are excreted from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract is needed to prevent escape and acquisition of genetic material that could confer a selective advantage to microbial communities. Here, we built a simple and lightweight biocontainment system that post-translationally activates a site-specific DNA endonuclease to degrade DNA at 18{degrees}C and not at higher temperatures. We constructed an orthogonal set of temperature sensitive-meganucleases, or TSMs, by inserting the yeast VMA1 L212P temperature-sensitive intein into the coding regions of LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases. We showed that the TSMs eliminated plasmids carrying the cognate TSM target site from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli at the permissive 18{degrees}C but not at higher restrictive temperatures. Plasmid elimination is dependent on both TSM endonuclease activity and intein splicing. We demonstrated that TSMs eliminated plasmids from the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain after passage through the mouse gut when fecal resuspensions were incubated at 18{degrees}C but not at 37{degrees}C. Collectively, our data demonstrates the potential of thermoregulated meganucleases as a means of restricting engineered plasmids and probiotics to the mammalian gut.\nDesign of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality\nAuthors: Mohsenin, H.; Wagner, H.; Rosenblatt, M.; Kemmer, S.; Timmer, J.; Weber, W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552766\nSynthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information-processing circuits into materials. Here, we engineer a set of protease-based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design-build-test-learn cycle, we wire the modules according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. We design a 2-input/4-output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that could perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and could be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.\nSynthetic Homoserine Lactone Sensors for Gram-Positive Bacillus subtilis using LuxR-type Regulators\nAuthors: Zeng, M.; Sarker, B.; Howitz, N.; Shah, I.; Andrews, L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553781\nA universal biochemical signal for bacterial cell-cell communication could facilitate programming dynamic responses in diverse bacterial consortia. However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via homoserine lactones (HSL) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively, to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for gram-positive Bacillus subtilis 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional HSL sensors ([\u0026ge;] 20-fold dynamic range) in B. subtilis for four different HSL chemical signals: p-coumaroyl-HSL, 3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, n-butyryl-HSL, and n-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL. This set of synthetic HSL sensors for a gram-positive bacterium can pave the way for designable interspecies communication within microbial consortia.\nEngineering a Synthetic Escherichia coli Coculture for Compartmentalized de novo Biosynthesis of Isobutyl Butyrate from Mixed Sugars\nAuthors: Seo, H.; Castro, G. I.; Trinh, C. T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553049\nShort-chain esters are versatile chemicals with use as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and fuels. The de novo ester biosynthesis consists of diverging and converging pathway submodules, which is challenging to engineer to achieve optimal metabolic fluxes and selective product synthesis. Compartmentalizing the pathway submodules into specialist cells that facilitate pathway modularization and labor division can present a promising solution. Here, we engineered a synthetic Escherichia coli coculture with the compartmentalized sugar utilization and ester biosynthesis pathways to produce isobutyl butyrate from a mixture of glucose and xylose. To compartmentalize the sugar-utilizing pathway submodules, we engineered a xylose-utilizing E. coli specialist that selectively consumes xylose over glucose and bypasses the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) while leveraging the native CCR machinery to activate a glucose-utilizing E. coli specialist. Upon compartmentalizing the isobutyl butyrate pathway submodules into these sugar-utilizing specialist cells, a robust synthetic coculture could be engineered to selectively produce isobutyl butyrate at a level of 392 mg/L, about 31-fold higher than the monoculture.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The fast-growing microbe Vibrio natriegens is capable of natural transformation where it draws DNA in from media via an active process under physiological conditions. Using an engineered strain with a genomic copy of the master competence regulator tfoX from Vibrio cholera in combination with a new minimal competence media (MCM) that uses acetate as an energy source, we demonstrate naturally competent cells which are created, transformed, and recovered entirely in the same media, without exchange or addition of new media. Cells are naturally competent to plasmids, recombination with linear DNA, and co-transformation of both to select for scarless and markerless genomic edits. The entire process is simple and inexpensive, requiring no capital equipment for an entirely room temperature process (Zero Capital protocol, 104 cfu/{micro}g), or just an incubator (High Efficiency protocol, 105-6 cfu/{micro}g). These cells retain their naturally competent state when frozen and are transformable immediately upon thawing like a typical chemical or electrochemical competent cell. Since the optimized transformation protocol requires only 50 minutes of hands-on time, and V. natriegens grows quickly even on plates, a transformation started at 9 AM yields abundant culturable single colonies by 5 PM. Further, because all stages of transformation occur in the same media, and the process can be arbitrarily scaled in volume, this natural competence strain and media could be ideal for automated directed evolution applications. As a result, naturally competent V. natriegens could compete with E. coli as an excellent chassis for low-cost and highly scalable synthetic biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) control gene expression, orchestrating tissue identity, developmental timing, and stimulus responses, which collectively define the thousands of unique cell types in the body. While there is great potential for strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology applications that require tissue specificity, there is no guarantee that an optimal CRE for an intended purpose has arisen naturally through evolution. Here, we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell type specificity. We leverage innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and empirically test thousands of CREs. Through in vitro and in vivo validation, we show that synthetic sequences outperform natural sequences from the human genome in driving cell type-specific expression. Synthetic sequences leverage unique sequence syntax to promote activity in the on-target cell type and simultaneously reduce activity in off-target cells. Together, we provide a generalizable framework to prospectively engineer CREs and demonstrate the required literacy to write regulatory code that is fit-for-purpose in vivo across vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Homing-based gene drives are novel interventions promising the area-wide, species-specific genetic control of harmful insect populations. Here we characterise a first set of gene drives in a tephritid agricultural pest species, the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (medfly). Our results show that the medfly is highly amenable to homing-based gene drive strategies. By targeting the medfly transformer gene, we also demonstrate two different mechanisms by which CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive can be coupled to sex conversion, whereby genetic females are transformed into fertile and harmless XX males. Given this unique malleability of sex determination, we modelled gene drive interventions that couple sex conversion and female sterility and found that such approaches could be effective and tolerant of resistant allele selection in the target population. Our results open the door for developing gene drive strains for the population suppression of the medfly and related tephritid pests by co-targeting female reproduction and shifting the reproductive sex ratio towards males. They demonstrate the untapped potential for gene drives to tackle agricultural pests in an environmentally friendly and economical way.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell-free expression systems provide a method for rapid DNA circuit prototyping and functional protein synthesis. While crude extracts remain a black box with many components carrying out unknown reactions, the PURE system contains only the required transcription and translation components for protein production. All proteins and small molecules are at known concentrations, opening up the possibility of detailed modeling for reliable computational predictions. However, there is little to no experimental data supporting the expression of target proteins for detailed protein models PURE models. In this work, we build a chemical reaction network transcription model for PURE protein synthesis. We compare the transcription models using DNA encoding for the malachite-green aptamer (MGapt) to measure mRNA production. Furthermore, we expand the PURE detailed translation model for an arbitrary set of amino acids and length. Lastly, we combine the transcription and the expanded translation models to create a PURE protein synthesis model built purely from mass-action reactions. We use the combined model to capture the translation of a plasmid encoding MGapt and deGFP under a T7-promoter and a strong RBS. The model accurately predicts the MGapt mRNA production for the first two hours, the dynamics of deGFP expression, and the total protein production with an accuracy within 10 %.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Whether synthetic genomes can power life has attracted broad interest in the synthetic biology field, especially when the synthetic genomes are extensively modified with thousands of designer features. Here we report de novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome thus far, synIV, a 1,454,621-bp Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome resulting from extensive genome streamlining and modification. During the construction of synIV, we developed megachunk assembly combined with a hierarchical integration strategy, which significantly increased the accuracy and flexibility of synthetic chromosome construction and facilitated chromosome debugging. In addition to the drastic sequence changes made to synIV by rewriting it, we further manipulated the three-dimensional structure of synIV in the yeast nucleus to explore spatial gene regulation within the nuclear space. Surprisingly, we found few gene expression changes, suggesting that positioning inside the yeast nucleoplasm plays a minor role in gene regulation. Lastly, we tethered synIV to the inner nuclear membrane via its hundreds of loxPsym sites and observed transcriptional repression of the entire chromosome, demonstrating chromosome-wide transcription manipulation without changing the DNA sequences. Our manipulation of the spatial structure of the largest synthetic yeast chromosome shed light on higher-order architectural design of the synthetic genomes.

        <p class="abstract">Limiting the spread of synthetic genetic information outside of the intended use is essential for applications where biocontainment is critical. In particular, biocontainment of engineered probiotics and plasmids that are excreted from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract is needed to prevent escape and acquisition of genetic material that could confer a selective advantage to microbial communities. Here, we built a simple and lightweight biocontainment system that post-translationally activates a site-specific DNA endonuclease to degrade DNA at 18{degrees}C and not at higher temperatures. We constructed an orthogonal set of temperature sensitive-meganucleases, or TSMs, by inserting the yeast VMA1 L212P temperature-sensitive intein into the coding regions of LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases. We showed that the TSMs eliminated plasmids carrying the cognate TSM target site from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli at the permissive 18{degrees}C but not at higher restrictive temperatures. Plasmid elimination is dependent on both TSM endonuclease activity and intein splicing. We demonstrated that TSMs eliminated plasmids from the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain after passage through the mouse gut when fecal resuspensions were incubated at 18{degrees}C but not at 37{degrees}C. Collectively, our data demonstrates the potential of thermoregulated meganucleases as a means of restricting engineered plasmids and probiotics to the mammalian gut.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information-processing circuits into materials. Here, we engineer a set of protease-based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design-build-test-learn cycle, we wire the modules according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. We design a 2-input/4-output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that could perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and could be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A universal biochemical signal for bacterial cell-cell communication could facilitate programming dynamic responses in diverse bacterial consortia. However, the classical quorum sensing paradigm is that gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria generally communicate via homoserine lactones (HSL) or oligopeptide molecular signals, respectively, to elicit population responses. Here, we create synthetic HSL sensors for gram-positive Bacillus subtilis 168 using allosteric LuxR-type regulators (RpaR, LuxR, RhlR, and CinR) and synthetic promoters. Promoters were combinatorially designed from different sequence elements (-35, -16, -10, and transcriptional start regions). We quantified the effects of these combinatorial promoters on sensor activity and determined how regulator expression affects its activation, achieving up to 293-fold activation. Using statistical design of experiments, we identified significant effects of promoter regions and pairwise interactions on sensor activity, which helped to understand the sequence-function relationships for synthetic promoter design. We present the first known set of functional HSL sensors ([&amp;ge;] 20-fold dynamic range) in B. subtilis for four different HSL chemical signals: p-coumaroyl-HSL, 3-oxohexanoyl-HSL, n-butyryl-HSL, and n-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-HSL. This set of synthetic HSL sensors for a gram-positive bacterium can pave the way for designable interspecies communication within microbial consortia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Short-chain esters are versatile chemicals with use as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and fuels. The de novo ester biosynthesis consists of diverging and converging pathway submodules, which is challenging to engineer to achieve optimal metabolic fluxes and selective product synthesis. Compartmentalizing the pathway submodules into specialist cells that facilitate pathway modularization and labor division can present a promising solution. Here, we engineered a synthetic Escherichia coli coculture with the compartmentalized sugar utilization and ester biosynthesis pathways to produce isobutyl butyrate from a mixture of glucose and xylose. To compartmentalize the sugar-utilizing pathway submodules, we engineered a xylose-utilizing E. coli specialist that selectively consumes xylose over glucose and bypasses the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) while leveraging the native CCR machinery to activate a glucose-utilizing E. coli specialist. Upon compartmentalizing the isobutyl butyrate pathway submodules into these sugar-utilizing specialist cells, a robust synthetic coculture could be engineered to selectively produce isobutyl butyrate at a level of 392 mg/L, about 31-fold higher than the monoculture.</p>
