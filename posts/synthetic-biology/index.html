M.\nScore: 19.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555787\nPhosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a LOV domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and non-perturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.\nRationally seeded computational protein design\nAuthors: Albanese, K. I.; Petrenas, R.; Pirro, F.; Naudin, E. A.; Borucu, U.; Dawson, W. M.; Scott, D. A.; Leggett, G. J.; Weiner, O. D.; Oliver, T.; Woolfson, D.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-08-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554789\nComputational protein design is advancing rapidly. Here we describe efficient routes to two families of -helical-barrel proteins with central channels that bind small molecules. The designs are seeded by the sequences and structures of defined de novo oligomeric barrel-forming peptides. Adjacent helices are connected using computational loop building. For targets with antiparallel helices, short loops are sufficient. However, targets with parallel helices require longer connectors; namely, an outer layer of helix-turn-helix-turn-helix motifs that are packed onto the barrels computationally. Throughout these pipelines, residues that define open states of the barrels are maintained. This minimises sequence sampling and accelerates routes to successful designs. For each of 6 targets, just 2 - 6 synthetic genes are made for expression in E. coli. On average, 80% express to give soluble monomeric proteins that are characterized fully, including high-resolution structures for most targets that match the seed structures and design models with high accuracy.\nEscherichia coli Microcin B17 as a chassis for the development of novel antimicrobial peptides.\nAuthors: Withanage, S.; Masschelein, J.; Pinheiro, V. B.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555279\nAntimicrobial resistance remains an urgent and growing global health problem. Peptides with antimicrobial activity are widespread in nature but are rarely harnessed for application, making them an underexplored and untapped resource. Many harbor post-translational modifications, which are essential for function and have evolved alongside specialized export and immunity machineries - leading to the current paradigm that natural sequences cannot be changed, and curtailing their development as antimicrobial agents. Nonetheless, we found sufficient ambiguity in literature to question if that remained true for E. coli MccB17. We demonstrate that its natural machinery for synthesis, export and immunity, can be co-opted as a platform for novel azole-modified antimicrobial peptide discovery. We show that the sequence space available for exploration is large and densely populated with functional sequences. One-Sentence SummaryE. coli can be harnessed as an in vivo platform for the isolation of novel antimicrobial azole-modified peptides.\nBuilding the bioeconomy: A targeted assessment approach to identifying biobased technologies, challenges and opportunities in the UK\nAuthors: Holland, C.; Shapira, P.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.554388\nWe explore opportunities, challenges, and strategies to translate and responsibly scale innovative biobased technologies to build more sustainable bioeconomies. The pandemic and other recent disruptions have increased exposure to issues of resilience and regional imbalance and raised attention to pathways that could shift production and consumption regimes based more on local biobased resources and dispersed production. The paper reviews potential biobased technologies strategies and then identifies promising and feasible options with a focus on the United Kingdom. Initial landscape and bibliometric analyses identified 50 potential existing and emerging potential biobased technologies. These technologies were assessed for their ability to fulfil requirements related to biobased production, national applicability, and economic, societal, and environmental benefits, leading to identification of 18 promising biobased production technologies. Through further analysis and focus group discussion with industrial, governmental, academic, agricultural, and social stakeholders, three technology clusters were identified for targeted assessment, drawing on cellulose-, lignin-, and seaweed-feedstocks. Case studies for each of these clusters were developed, addressing conversations around sustainable management and the use of biomass feedstocks, and associated environmental, social, and economic challenges. These cases are presented with discussion of insights and implications for policy. The approach presented in the paper is put forward as a scalable assessment method which can be useful in prompting, informing, and advancing discussion and deliberation on opportunities and challenges for biobased transformations.\nA synthetic biology approach to transgene expression\nAuthors: Leftwich, P. T.; Purcell, J. C.; Anderson, M. A. E.; Fragkoudis, R.; Basu, S.; Lycett, G. T.; Alphey, L.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555539\nThe ability to control gene expression is pivotal in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. However, in most non-model and pest insect species, empirical evidence for predictable modulation of gene expression levels is lacking. This knowledge gap is critical for genetic control systems, particularly in mosquitoes, where transgenic methods offer novel routes for pest control. Commonly, the choice of RNA polymerase II promoter (Pol II) is the primary method for controlling gene expression, but the options are limited. To address this, we developed a systematic approach to characterize modifications in translation initiation sequences (TIS) and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of transgenes, enabling the creation of a toolbox for gene expression modulation in mosquitoes and potentially other insects. The approach demonstrated highly predictable gene expression changes across various cell lines and promoter sequences, representing a significant advancement in mosquito synthetic biology gene expression.\nCell free expression in proteinosomes prepared from native protein-PNIPAAm conjugates\nAuthors: Gao, M.; Wang, D.; Wilsch-Brauninger, M.; Leng, W.; Schulte, J.; Morgner, N.; Appelhans, D.; Tang, T.-Y. D.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554401\nTowards the goal of building synthetic cells from the bottom-up, the establishment of micrometer-sized compartments that contain and support cell free transcription and translation that couple cellular structure to function is of critical importance. Proteinosomes, formed from crosslinked cationized protein-polymer conjugates offer a promising solution to membrane-bound compartmentalisation with an open, semi-permeable membrane. Critically, to date, there have been no demonstration of cell free transcription and translation within water-in-water proteinosomes. Herein, we present a novel approach to the fabrication of proteinosomes directly from native protein-polymer (BSA-PNIPAAm) conjugates. We show that these native proteinosomes offer an excellent alternative as artificial cell chassis. Significantly, the native proteinosomes are stable under high salt conditions and can consequently support cell free transcription and translation. The native proteinosomes offer enhanced protein expression compared to proteinosomes prepared from traditional methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of proteinosomes into higher order cellular architectures with membrane free compartments and liposomes. The integration of bioinspired architectural elements with the central dogma is an essential building block for realizing minimal synthetic cells and is key for exploiting artificial cells in real-world applications.\nMicrobial cell factory optimisation using genome-wide host-pathway interaction screens\nAuthors: Cachera, P. P.-Y. J.; Kurt, N. C.; Ropke, A.; Strucko, T.; Mortensen, U. H.; Jensen, M. K.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555557\nThe ubiquity of genetic interactions in living cells challenges the concept of parts orthogonality, which is a cornerstone of synthetic biology. Parts, such as heterologously expressed genes, draw from shared pools of limited cellular resources and interactions between parts themselves and their host are inevitable. Instead of trying to eliminate or disregard these interactions, we propose to leverage them to promote desirable phenotypes. We recently described CRI-SPA, a method for high-throughput genome-wide gene delivery and screening of host:pathway interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we combine this method with biosensor-based high-throughput screening and high-density colony image analysis to identify lead engineering targets for optimising cis-cis-muconic acid (CCM) production in yeast cell factories. Using the biosensor screen, we phenotype \u003e9,700 genotypes for their interaction with the heterologously expressed CCM biosynthesis pathway, including both gene knock-out and overexpression, and identify novel metabolic targets belonging to sulphur assimilation and methionine synthesis, as well as cellular redox homeostasis, positively impacting CCM biosynthesis by up to 280%. Our genome-wide exploration of host pathway interaction opens novel strategies for the metabolic engineering of yeast cell factories.\nCell-Free Protein Expression in Polymer Materials\nAuthors: Lee, M. F. S.; Lee, J. A.; Biondo, J. R.; Lux, J. E.; Raig, R. M.; Berger, P. N.; Bernhards, C. B.; Kuhn, D. L.; Gupta, M. K.; Lux, M. W.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553881\nWhile synthetic biology has advanced complex capabilities like sensing and molecule synthesis in aqueous solutions, important applications may also be pursued for biological systems in solid materials. Harsh processing conditions used to produce many synthetic materials such as plastics makes incorporation of biological functionality challenging. One technology that shows promise in circumventing these issues is cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), where core cellular functionality is reconstituted outside the cell. CFPS enables genetic functions to be implemented without the complications of membrane transport or concerns over cellular viability or release of genetically modified organisms. Here we demonstrate that dried CFPS reactions have remarkable tolerance to heat and organic solvent exposure during the casting processes for polymer materials. We demonstrate the utility of this observation by creating plastics that have spatially patterned genetic functionality, produce antimicrobials in situ, and perform sensing reactions. The resulting materials unlock the potential to deliver DNA-programmable bio-functionality in a ubiquitous class of synthetic materials.\nTargeting mosquito X-chromosomes reveals complex transmission dynamics of sex ratio distorting gene drives\nAuthors: Haber, D. A.; Arien, Y.; Lamdan, L. B.; Alcalay, Y.; Zecharia, C.; Krsticevic, F.; Yonah, E. S.; Avraham, R. D.; Windbichler, N.; Papathanos, P. A.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554004\nEngineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of both self-limiting and self-sustaining genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pest or disease vector populations such as malaria mosquitoes. Two different CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms, X-shredding which eliminates X-bearing sperm in males and X-poisoning which causes postzygotic mortality of daughters inheriting disrupted X-linked genes, have been proposed. The nature of the sex distortion mechanism is predicted to affect the population dynamics of released Y-chromosome SRDs: A Y-linked X-shredder is invasive constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas Y-linked X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection and disappearance. Here, we established the first X-poisoning SRD system in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae targeting three X-linked ribosomal protein (RP) genes during spermatogenesis. Surprisingly, when we characterized transgenic strains showing a significant male bias, we found that sex distortion was primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of daughters. By leveraging the Drosophila model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explored premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs, once trade-offs between sex chromosome transmission distortion and male fertility are functionally balanced.\nA molecular proximity sensor based on an engineered, dual-component guide RNA\nAuthors: Choi, J.; Chen, W.; Liao, H.; Li, X.; Shendure, J.\nScore: 38.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553235\nOne of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a LOV domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and non-perturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Computational protein design is advancing rapidly. Here we describe efficient routes to two families of -helical-barrel proteins with central channels that bind small molecules. The designs are seeded by the sequences and structures of defined de novo oligomeric barrel-forming peptides. Adjacent helices are connected using computational loop building. For targets with antiparallel helices, short loops are sufficient. However, targets with parallel helices require longer connectors; namely, an outer layer of helix-turn-helix-turn-helix motifs that are packed onto the barrels computationally. Throughout these pipelines, residues that define open states of the barrels are maintained. This minimises sequence sampling and accelerates routes to successful designs. For each of 6 targets, just 2 - 6 synthetic genes are made for expression in E. coli. On average, 80% express to give soluble monomeric proteins that are characterized fully, including high-resolution structures for most targets that match the seed structures and design models with high accuracy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Antimicrobial resistance remains an urgent and growing global health problem. Peptides with antimicrobial activity are widespread in nature but are rarely harnessed for application, making them an underexplored and untapped resource. Many harbor post-translational modifications, which are essential for function and have evolved alongside specialized export and immunity machineries - leading to the current paradigm that natural sequences cannot be changed, and curtailing their development as antimicrobial agents. Nonetheless, we found sufficient ambiguity in literature to question if that remained true for E. coli MccB17. We demonstrate that its natural machinery for synthesis, export and immunity, can be co-opted as a platform for novel azole-modified antimicrobial peptide discovery. We show that the sequence space available for exploration is large and densely populated with functional sequences.

One-Sentence SummaryE. coli can be harnessed as an in vivo platform for the isolation of novel antimicrobial azole-modified peptides.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We explore opportunities, challenges, and strategies to translate and responsibly scale innovative biobased technologies to build more sustainable bioeconomies. The pandemic and other recent disruptions have increased exposure to issues of resilience and regional imbalance and raised attention to pathways that could shift production and consumption regimes based more on local biobased resources and dispersed production. The paper reviews potential biobased technologies strategies and then identifies promising and feasible options with a focus on the United Kingdom. Initial landscape and bibliometric analyses identified 50 potential existing and emerging potential biobased technologies. These technologies were assessed for their ability to fulfil requirements related to biobased production, national applicability, and economic, societal, and environmental benefits, leading to identification of 18 promising biobased production technologies. Through further analysis and focus group discussion with industrial, governmental, academic, agricultural, and social stakeholders, three technology clusters were identified for targeted assessment, drawing on cellulose-, lignin-, and seaweed-feedstocks. Case studies for each of these clusters were developed, addressing conversations around sustainable management and the use of biomass feedstocks, and associated environmental, social, and economic challenges. These cases are presented with discussion of insights and implications for policy. The approach presented in the paper is put forward as a scalable assessment method which can be useful in prompting, informing, and advancing discussion and deliberation on opportunities and challenges for biobased transformations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to control gene expression is pivotal in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. However, in most non-model and pest insect species, empirical evidence for predictable modulation of gene expression levels is lacking. This knowledge gap is critical for genetic control systems, particularly in mosquitoes, where transgenic methods offer novel routes for pest control. Commonly, the choice of RNA polymerase II promoter (Pol II) is the primary method for controlling gene expression, but the options are limited. To address this, we developed a systematic approach to characterize modifications in translation initiation sequences (TIS) and 3&#39; untranslated regions (UTR) of transgenes, enabling the creation of a toolbox for gene expression modulation in mosquitoes and potentially other insects. The approach demonstrated highly predictable gene expression changes across various cell lines and promoter sequences, representing a significant advancement in mosquito synthetic biology gene expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Towards the goal of building synthetic cells from the bottom-up, the establishment of micrometer-sized compartments that contain and support cell free transcription and translation that couple cellular structure to function is of critical importance. Proteinosomes, formed from crosslinked cationized protein-polymer conjugates offer a promising solution to membrane-bound compartmentalisation with an open, semi-permeable membrane. Critically, to date, there have been no demonstration of cell free transcription and translation within water-in-water proteinosomes. Herein, we present a novel approach to the fabrication of proteinosomes directly from native protein-polymer (BSA-PNIPAAm) conjugates. We show that these native proteinosomes offer an excellent alternative as artificial cell chassis. Significantly, the native proteinosomes are stable under high salt conditions and can consequently support cell free transcription and translation. The native proteinosomes offer enhanced protein expression compared to proteinosomes prepared from traditional methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of proteinosomes into higher order cellular architectures with membrane free compartments and liposomes. The integration of bioinspired architectural elements with the central dogma is an essential building block for realizing minimal synthetic cells and is key for exploiting artificial cells in real-world applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ubiquity of genetic interactions in living cells challenges the concept of parts orthogonality, which is a cornerstone of synthetic biology. Parts, such as heterologously expressed genes, draw from shared pools of limited cellular resources and interactions between parts themselves and their host are inevitable. Instead of trying to eliminate or disregard these interactions, we propose to leverage them to promote desirable phenotypes. We recently described CRI-SPA, a method for high-throughput genome-wide gene delivery and screening of host:pathway interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we combine this method with biosensor-based high-throughput screening and high-density colony image analysis to identify lead engineering targets for optimising cis-cis-muconic acid (CCM) production in yeast cell factories. Using the biosensor screen, we phenotype &gt;9,700 genotypes for their interaction with the heterologously expressed CCM biosynthesis pathway, including both gene knock-out and overexpression, and identify novel metabolic targets belonging to sulphur assimilation and methionine synthesis, as well as cellular redox homeostasis, positively impacting CCM biosynthesis by up to 280%. Our genome-wide exploration of host pathway interaction opens novel strategies for the metabolic engineering of yeast cell factories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While synthetic biology has advanced complex capabilities like sensing and molecule synthesis in aqueous solutions, important applications may also be pursued for biological systems in solid materials. Harsh processing conditions used to produce many synthetic materials such as plastics makes incorporation of biological functionality challenging. One technology that shows promise in circumventing these issues is cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), where core cellular functionality is reconstituted outside the cell. CFPS enables genetic functions to be implemented without the complications of membrane transport or concerns over cellular viability or release of genetically modified organisms. Here we demonstrate that dried CFPS reactions have remarkable tolerance to heat and organic solvent exposure during the casting processes for polymer materials. We demonstrate the utility of this observation by creating plastics that have spatially patterned genetic functionality, produce antimicrobials in situ, and perform sensing reactions. The resulting materials unlock the potential to deliver DNA-programmable bio-functionality in a ubiquitous class of synthetic materials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Engineered sex ratio distorters (SRDs) have been proposed as a powerful component of both self-limiting and self-sustaining genetic control strategies designed to suppress harmful insect pest or disease vector populations such as malaria mosquitoes. Two different CRISPR-based SRD mechanisms, X-shredding which eliminates X-bearing sperm in males and X-poisoning which causes postzygotic mortality of daughters inheriting disrupted X-linked genes, have been proposed. The nature of the sex distortion mechanism is predicted to affect the population dynamics of released Y-chromosome SRDs: A Y-linked X-shredder is invasive constituting a classical meiotic Y-drive, whereas Y-linked X-poisoning is self-limiting, unable to invade but also insulated from selection and disappearance. Here, we established the first X-poisoning SRD system in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae targeting three X-linked ribosomal protein (RP) genes during spermatogenesis. Surprisingly, when we characterized transgenic strains showing a significant male bias, we found that sex distortion was primarily driven by a loss of X-bearing sperm with limited evidence for postzygotic lethality of daughters. By leveraging the Drosophila model, we show unambiguously that engineered SRD traits can operate differently in these two insects. Unlike X-shredding, X-poisoning could theoretically operate at early stages of spermatogenesis. We therefore explored premeiotic Cas9 expression to target the mosquito X-chromosome. We find that, by pre-empting the onset of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, this approach may enable the development of Y-linked SRDs, once trade-offs between sex chromosome transmission distortion and male fertility are functionally balanced.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.</p>
