P.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563757\nAll cells are encapsulated by a lipid membrane which facilitates the interaction between life and its environment. The property and function of the cell membrane is critically dependent on its lipidome composition which can range from 10s to 100s of unique lipid structures. How life has evolved to exploit such diverse mixtures of lipids has been experimentally challenging to address. In this study, we introduce a simple approach to minimize and tune lipidome composition in Mycoplasma mycoides and the Minimal Cell (JCVI-Syn3A). By varying the lipid composition of the growth medium, and introducing unmodifiable diether phospholipids, we demonstrate that a lipidome composed of two lipids can support life. By systematically reintroducing phospholipid features, we show that acyl chain diversity is more critical for supporting growth than head group diversity. We also reveal significant effects of altering phospholipid chirality on membrane permeability, cellular robustness, and growth, demonstrating how subtle changes in lipid stereochemistry can have profound effects on cell fitness. Our approach to tune mycoplasma lipidome composition introduces a minimal living model membrane system to understand the design principles and the role of lipid complexity in bioengineering of cell membranes.\nTowards AI-designed genomes using a variational autoencoder\nAuthors: Dudek, N. K.; Precup, D.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563484\nSynthetic biology holds great promise for bioengineering applications such as environmental bioremediation, probiotic formulation, and production of renewable biofuels. Humans capacity to design biological systems from scratch is limited by their sheer size and complexity. We introduce a framework for training a machine learning model to learn the basic genetic principles underlying the gene composition of bacterial genomes. Our variational autoencoder model, DeepGenomeVector, was trained to take as input corrupted bacterial genetic blueprints (i.e. complete gene sets, henceforth genome vectors) in which most genes had been \"removed\", and re-create the original. The resulting model effectively captures the complex dependencies in genomic networks, as evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative metrics. An in-depth functional analysis of a generated gene vector shows that its encoded pathways are interconnected and nearly complete. On the test set, where the models ability to re-generate the original, uncorrupted genome vector was evaluated, an AUC score of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.82 provide support for the models ability to generate diverse, high-quality genome vectors. This work showcases the power of machine learning approaches for synthetic biology and highlights the possibility that just as humans can design an AI that animates a robot, AIs may one day be able to design a genomic blueprint that animates a carbon-based cell. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGenomes serve as the blueprints for life, encoding complex networks of genes whose products must seamlessly interact to result in living organisms. In this work, we develop a framework for training a machine learning algorithm to learn the basic genetic principles that underlie genome composition. This innovation may eventually lead to improvements in the genome design process, increasing the speed and reliability of designs while decreasing cost. It further suggests that AI agents may one day have the potential to design blueprints for carbon-based life.\nEngineered yeast cells simulating CD19+ cancers to control CAR T cell activation\nAuthors: Deichmann, M.; Schiesaro, G.; Ramanathan, K.; Zeeberg, K. V. W.; Koefoed, N. M. T.; Ormhoj, M.; Friis, R. U. W.; Gill, R. T.; Hadrup, S. R.; Jensen, E. D.; Jensen, M. K.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563929\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have become an established form of immunotherapy and continue to show promising results for the treatment of hematological cancers in most patients. While this immunotherapy continues to generate excitement in the clinic, antigen modulation in cancer cells affects the quality and safety of CAR T cell therapy. Here we present the engineering of yeast to robustly and dynamically modulate antigen densities, hence establishing a novel tool for assessing antigen-density thresholds in CAR T cell responses. Using a synthetic biology approach, we successfully engineer yeast to simulate cancer cells and demonstrate i) controllable antigen densities of CD19 through the use of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ii) a customizable system for tuning antigen densities through the employment of heterologous GPCRs for defining signal input types and signal pathway engineering for adapting intensities, and iii) activational control of clinically-derived CAR T cells within a physiologically relevant range compared to the activation elicited by a NALM6 cancer cell line. Based on this yeast-based antigen-presenting cell system, we envision an efficient assessment of how varying antigen densities in cancer cells from patients affect CAR T cell responses and ultimately support safer and better quality of personalized cancer therapies.\nDNA nanostructure-templated antibody complexes provide insights into the geometric requirements of human complement cascade activation\nAuthors: Abendstein, L.; Noteborn, W.; Veenman, L.; Dijkstra, D.; Bovenkamp, F. v. d.; Trouw, L.; Sharp, T.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.562751\nThe classical complement pathway is activated by antigen-bound IgG antibodies. Monomeric IgG must oligomerize to activate complement via the hexameric C1q complex, and hexamerizing mutants of IgG appear as promising therapeutic candidates. However, structural data have shown that it is not necessary to bind all six C1q arms to initiate complement, revealing a symmetry mismatch between C1 and the hexameric IgG complex, which has not been adequately explained. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to produce specific nanostructures to template antigens, and thereby control IgG valency. These DNA nano-templated IgG complexes can activate complement on cell-mimetic lipid membranes, which enabled us to determine the effect of IgG valency on complement activation without the requirement to mutate antibodies. We investigated this using biophysical assays together with 3D cryo-electron tomography. Our data revealed that the cleavage of complement component C4 by the C1 complex is proportional to the number of antigens. Increased IgG valency also translated to better terminal pathway activation and membrane attack complex formation. Together, these data provide insights into how nanopatterning antigen-antibody complexes influence the activation of the C1 complex and suggest routes to modulate complement activation by antibody engineering. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first time DNA nanotechnology has been used to study the activation of the complement system.\nBacteriocin peer selection for the production of antibiotic selection free biotherapeutic pDNA\nAuthors: El Bakkoury, M.; P. Gomez de Cadinanos, L.; Gabant, P.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563565\nPlasmid vectors are well established tools used to genetically engineer bacteria both in the laboratory and at industrial scale. The past few decades have seen a rising interest in the use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) for biotherapeutic applications. This interest is a strong driver for the development of technologies to increase pDNA production at biopharmaceutical scale in terms of decreasing production costs and meeting regulatory requirements. Although cell free technologies are emerging, pDNA vectors are still produced by fermentation in Escherichia coli strains. As plasmids are extra-chromosomic molecules there is a probability of losing a certain ratio within the E. coli population during the fermentation process leading to a decrease of DNA production efficiency. Maintaining pDNA in the population is thus a key element to reach efficient and robust production. Traditionally, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics have been used to generate a selective pressure to ensure pDNA stability in the microbial population during the production process. Nowadays, having an antibiotic resistance gene in the pDNA coding sequence represents a limitation both for safety and legal requirements and in terms of production yield. For this reason, we have developed a pDNA antibiotic-free bacteriocin-based selection system, based on the genes involved in the production, processing, secretion and immunity of the bacteriocin microcin V. Our approach is based on the peer pressure exerted by the bacteriocin and does not rely on the addition of any selective agent in the medium to limit population drift and ensure plasmid stability. This novel antibiotic-free approach may be applied to any pDNA vector in different E. coli strains and expands their potential applications in both animal and human health as delivery vectors for biotherapeutics.\nLight-driven synchronization of optogenetic clocks\nAuthors: Cannarsa, M. C.; Liguori, F.; Pellicciotta, N.; Frangipane, G.; Di Leonardo, R.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563722\nSynthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in E. coli, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the systems response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.\nA three-node Turing gene circuit forms periodic spatial patterns in bacteria\nAuthors: Tica, J.; Oliver Huidobro, M.; Zhu, T.; Wachter, G. K. A.; H. Pazuki, R.; Tonello, E.; Siebert, H.; Stumpf, M. P. H.; Endres, R. G.; Isalan, M.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563112\nTuring patterns1 are well-known self-organising systems that can form spots, stripes, or labyrinths. They represent a major theory of patterning in tissue organisation, due to their remarkable similarity to some natural patterns, such as skin pigmentation in zebrafish2, digit spacing3,4, and many others. The involvement of Turing patterns in biology has been debated because of their stringent fine-tuning requirements, where patterns only occur within a small subset of parameters5,6. This has complicated the engineering of a synthetic gene circuit for Turing patterns from first principles, even though natural genetic Turing networks have been successfully identified4,7. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic reaction-diffusion system where three nodes interact according to a non-classical Turing network with improved parametric robustness6. The system was optimised in E. coli and reproducibly generated stationary, periodic, concentric stripe patterns in growing colonies. The patterns were successfully reproduced with a partial differential equation model, in a parameter regime obtained by fitting to experimental data. Our synthetic Turing system can contribute to novel nanotechnologies, such as patterned biomaterial deposition8,9, and provide insights into developmental patterning programs10.\nA Straightforward Approach for Living Biomembrane Printing onto Nanoparticle\nAuthors: Mizuta, R.; Kanao, E.; Ukyo, K.; Sawada, S.-i.; Ishihama, Y.; Sasaki, Y.; Akiyoshi, K.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563496\nBiomembrane coating technologies have increasingly been pursued to grant natural dynamic bio-interfaces onto synthetic nanomaterials. Herein, we report a one-step method to coat \"living\" biomembrane on nanoparticle surfaces in a non-destructive manner. In our method, nanoparticles were efficiently coated with cell membranes without losing the structural integrity by mechanically facilitating the passage of nanoparticles to a concentration layer of living cells with simple centrifugation. This was similar to the exosome-releasing process via endocytosis and exocytosis. The biomembrane originating from living Raw264.7 cells was coated onto the silica nanoparticle prepared by our method, and proteome profiling with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated that it was constructed with proteins derived from the membranous component. This proteome profile was not observed in silica nanoparticles prepared with dead cells. Finally, the hybridized cell membrane effectively suppressed the phagocytic activity of Raw264.7 cells to silica nanoparticles and improved the uptake efficiency into cancer cells. We believe our simple and efficient method to coat living biomembranes should be useful in developing medical and pharmaceutical applications involving nanoparticles.\nProbiotic neoantigen delivery vectors for precision cancer immunotherapy\nAuthors: Redenti, A.; Im, J.; Redenti, B.; Li, F.; Rouanne, M.; Sheng, Z.; Sun, W.; Gurbatri, C.

With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home to tumors5-7 and modulate anti-tumor immunity8,9, one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines10-12. In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumor-specific neoantigen-derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective, and durable systemic anti-tumor immunity.\nExpression of Filaments of the Geobacter Extracellular Cytochrome OmcS in Shewanella oneidensis\nAuthors: Lin, T.; Ding, W.; Zhang, D.; Yang, Y.; Li, F.; Xu, D.; Lovley, D. R.; Song, H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564108\nThe physiological role of Geobacter sulfurreducens extracellular cytochrome filaments is a matter of debate and the development of proposed electronic device applications of cytochrome filaments awaits methods for large-scale cytochrome nanowire production. Functional studies in Geobacter sulfurreducens are stymied by the broad diversity of redox-active proteins on the outer cell surface and the redundancy and plasticity of extracellular electron transport routes. G. sulfurreducens is a poor chassis for producing cytochrome nanowires for electronics because of its slow, anaerobic growth. Here we report that filaments of the G. sulfurreducens cytochrome OmcS can be heterologously expressed in Shewanella oneidensis. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrated that a strain of S. oneidensis, expressing the G. sulfurreducens OmcS gene on a plasmid, localized OmcS on the outer cell surface. Atomic force microscopy revealed filaments with the unique morphology of OmcS filaments emanating from cells. Electron transfer to OmcS appeared to require a functional outer-membrane porin-cytochrome conduit. The results suggest that S. oneidensis, which grows rapidly to high culture densities under aerobic conditions, may be a suitable for development of a chassis for producing cytochrome nanowires for electronics applications and may also be good model microbe for elucidating cytochrome filament function in anaerobic extracellular electron transfer.\n",

        <p class="abstract">All cells are encapsulated by a lipid membrane which facilitates the interaction between life and its environment. The property and function of the cell membrane is critically dependent on its lipidome composition which can range from 10s to 100s of unique lipid structures. How life has evolved to exploit such diverse mixtures of lipids has been experimentally challenging to address. In this study, we introduce a simple approach to minimize and tune lipidome composition in Mycoplasma mycoides and the Minimal Cell (JCVI-Syn3A). By varying the lipid composition of the growth medium, and introducing unmodifiable diether phospholipids, we demonstrate that a lipidome composed of two lipids can support life. By systematically reintroducing phospholipid features, we show that acyl chain diversity is more critical for supporting growth than head group diversity. We also reveal significant effects of altering phospholipid chirality on membrane permeability, cellular robustness, and growth, demonstrating how subtle changes in lipid stereochemistry can have profound effects on cell fitness. Our approach to tune mycoplasma lipidome composition introduces a minimal living model membrane system to understand the design principles and the role of lipid complexity in bioengineering of cell membranes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic biology holds great promise for bioengineering applications such as environmental bioremediation, probiotic formulation, and production of renewable biofuels. Humans capacity to design biological systems from scratch is limited by their sheer size and complexity. We introduce a framework for training a machine learning model to learn the basic genetic principles underlying the gene composition of bacterial genomes. Our variational autoencoder model, DeepGenomeVector, was trained to take as input corrupted bacterial genetic blueprints (i.e. complete gene sets, henceforth  genome vectors) in which most genes had been &#34;removed&#34;, and re-create the original. The resulting model effectively captures the complex dependencies in genomic networks, as evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative metrics. An in-depth functional analysis of a generated gene vector shows that its encoded pathways are interconnected and nearly complete. On the test set, where the models ability to re-generate the original, uncorrupted genome vector was evaluated, an AUC score of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.82 provide support for the models ability to generate diverse, high-quality genome vectors. This work showcases the power of machine learning approaches for synthetic biology and highlights the possibility that just as humans can design an AI that animates a robot, AIs may one day be able to design a genomic blueprint that animates a carbon-based cell.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGenomes serve as the blueprints for life, encoding complex networks of genes whose products must seamlessly interact to result in living organisms. In this work, we develop a framework for training a machine learning algorithm to learn the basic genetic principles that underlie genome composition. This innovation may eventually lead to improvements in the genome design process, increasing the speed and reliability of designs while decreasing cost. It further suggests that AI agents may one day have the potential to design blueprints for carbon-based life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have become an established form of immunotherapy and continue to show promising results for the treatment of hematological cancers in most patients. While this immunotherapy continues to generate excitement in the clinic, antigen modulation in cancer cells affects the quality and safety of CAR T cell therapy. Here we present the engineering of yeast to robustly and dynamically modulate antigen densities, hence establishing a novel tool for assessing antigen-density thresholds in CAR T cell responses. Using a synthetic biology approach, we successfully engineer yeast to simulate cancer cells and demonstrate i) controllable antigen densities of CD19 through the use of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ii) a customizable system for tuning antigen densities through the employment of heterologous GPCRs for defining signal input types and signal pathway engineering for adapting intensities, and iii) activational control of clinically-derived CAR T cells within a physiologically relevant range compared to the activation elicited by a NALM6 cancer cell line. Based on this yeast-based antigen-presenting cell system, we envision an efficient assessment of how varying antigen densities in cancer cells from patients affect CAR T cell responses and ultimately support safer and better quality of personalized cancer therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The classical complement pathway is activated by antigen-bound IgG antibodies. Monomeric IgG must oligomerize to activate complement via the hexameric C1q complex, and hexamerizing mutants of IgG appear as promising therapeutic candidates. However, structural data have shown that it is not necessary to bind all six C1q arms to initiate complement, revealing a symmetry mismatch between C1 and the hexameric IgG complex, which has not been adequately explained. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to produce specific nanostructures to template antigens, and thereby control IgG valency. These DNA nano-templated IgG complexes can activate complement on cell-mimetic lipid membranes, which enabled us to determine the effect of IgG valency on complement activation without the requirement to mutate antibodies. We investigated this using biophysical assays together with 3D cryo-electron tomography. Our data revealed that the cleavage of complement component C4 by the C1 complex is proportional to the number of antigens. Increased IgG valency also translated to better terminal pathway activation and membrane attack complex formation. Together, these data provide insights into how nanopatterning antigen-antibody complexes influence the activation of the C1 complex and suggest routes to modulate complement activation by antibody engineering. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first time DNA nanotechnology has been used to study the activation of the complement system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Plasmid vectors are well established tools used to genetically engineer bacteria both in the laboratory and at industrial scale. The past few decades have seen a rising interest in the use of plasmid DNA (pDNA) for biotherapeutic applications. This interest is a strong driver for the development of technologies to increase pDNA production at biopharmaceutical scale in terms of decreasing production costs and meeting regulatory requirements. Although cell free technologies are emerging, pDNA vectors are still produced by fermentation in Escherichia coli strains. As plasmids are extra-chromosomic molecules there is a probability of losing a certain ratio within the E. coli population during the fermentation process leading to a decrease of DNA production efficiency. Maintaining pDNA in the population is thus a key element to reach efficient and robust production. Traditionally, antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics have been used to generate a selective pressure to ensure pDNA stability in the microbial population during the production process. Nowadays, having an antibiotic resistance gene in the pDNA coding sequence represents a limitation both for safety and legal requirements and in terms of production yield. For this reason, we have developed a pDNA antibiotic-free bacteriocin-based selection system, based on the genes involved in the production, processing, secretion and immunity of the bacteriocin microcin V. Our approach is based on the peer pressure exerted by the bacteriocin and does not rely on the addition of any selective agent in the medium to limit population drift and ensure plasmid stability. This novel antibiotic-free approach may be applied to any pDNA vector in different E. coli strains and expands their potential applications in both animal and human health as delivery vectors for biotherapeutics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in E. coli, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the systems response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Turing patterns1 are well-known self-organising systems that can form spots, stripes, or labyrinths. They represent a major theory of patterning in tissue organisation, due to their remarkable similarity to some natural patterns, such as skin pigmentation in zebrafish2, digit spacing3,4, and many others. The involvement of Turing patterns in biology has been debated because of their stringent fine-tuning requirements, where patterns only occur within a small subset of parameters5,6. This has complicated the engineering of a synthetic gene circuit for Turing patterns from first principles, even though natural genetic Turing networks have been successfully identified4,7. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic reaction-diffusion system where three nodes interact according to a non-classical Turing network with improved parametric robustness6. The system was optimised in E. coli and reproducibly generated stationary, periodic, concentric stripe patterns in growing colonies. The patterns were successfully reproduced with a partial differential equation model, in a parameter regime obtained by fitting to experimental data. Our synthetic Turing system can contribute to novel nanotechnologies, such as patterned biomaterial deposition8,9, and provide insights into developmental patterning programs10.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biomembrane coating technologies have increasingly been pursued to grant natural dynamic bio-interfaces onto synthetic nanomaterials. Herein, we report a one-step method to coat &#34;living&#34; biomembrane on nanoparticle surfaces in a non-destructive manner. In our method, nanoparticles were efficiently coated with cell membranes without losing the structural integrity by mechanically facilitating the passage of nanoparticles to a concentration layer of living cells with simple centrifugation. This was similar to the exosome-releasing process via endocytosis and exocytosis. The biomembrane originating from living Raw264.7 cells was coated onto the silica nanoparticle prepared by our method, and proteome profiling with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry demonstrated that it was constructed with proteins derived from the membranous component. This proteome profile was not observed in silica nanoparticles prepared with dead cells. Finally, the hybridized cell membrane effectively suppressed the phagocytic activity of Raw264.7 cells to silica nanoparticles and improved the uptake efficiency into cancer cells. We believe our simple and efficient method to coat living biomembranes should be useful in developing medical and pharmaceutical applications involving nanoparticles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microbial systems have been synthetically engineered to deploy therapeutic payloads in vivo1-4. With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home to tumors5-7 and modulate anti-tumor immunity8,9, one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines10-12. In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4&#43; and CD8&#43; T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumor-specific neoantigen-derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective, and durable systemic anti-tumor immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The physiological role of Geobacter sulfurreducens extracellular cytochrome filaments is a matter of debate and the development of proposed electronic device applications of cytochrome filaments awaits methods for large-scale cytochrome nanowire production. Functional studies in Geobacter sulfurreducens are stymied by the broad diversity of redox-active proteins on the outer cell surface and the redundancy and plasticity of extracellular electron transport routes. G. sulfurreducens is a poor chassis for producing cytochrome nanowires for electronics because of its slow, anaerobic growth. Here we report that filaments of the G. sulfurreducens cytochrome OmcS can be heterologously expressed in Shewanella oneidensis. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrated that a strain of S. oneidensis, expressing the G. sulfurreducens OmcS gene on a plasmid, localized OmcS on the outer cell surface. Atomic force microscopy revealed filaments with the unique morphology of OmcS filaments emanating from cells. Electron transfer to OmcS appeared to require a functional outer-membrane porin-cytochrome conduit. The results suggest that S. oneidensis, which grows rapidly to high culture densities under aerobic conditions, may be a suitable for development of a chassis for producing cytochrome nanowires for electronics applications and may also be good model microbe for elucidating cytochrome filament function in anaerobic extracellular electron transfer.</p>
