H.; Jensen, M. K.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555557\nThe ubiquity of genetic interactions in living cells challenges the concept of parts orthogonality, which is a cornerstone of synthetic biology. Parts, such as heterologously expressed genes, draw from shared pools of limited cellular resources and interactions between parts themselves and their host are inevitable. Instead of trying to eliminate or disregard these interactions, we propose to leverage them to promote desirable phenotypes. We recently described CRI-SPA, a method for high-throughput genome-wide gene delivery and screening of host:pathway interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we combine this method with biosensor-based high-throughput screening and high-density colony image analysis to identify lead engineering targets for optimising cis-cis-muconic acid (CCM) production in yeast cell factories. Using the biosensor screen, we phenotype \u003e9,700 genotypes for their interaction with the heterologously expressed CCM biosynthesis pathway, including both gene knock-out and overexpression, and identify novel metabolic targets belonging to sulphur assimilation and methionine synthesis, as well as cellular redox homeostasis, positively impacting CCM biosynthesis by up to 280%. Our genome-wide exploration of host pathway interaction opens novel strategies for the metabolic engineering of yeast cell factories.\nA hybrid combination of in vitro cultured buccal mucosal cells using two different methodologies, complementing each other in successfully repairing a stricture-inflicted human male urethral epithelium\nAuthors: Horiguchi, A.; Kushibiki, T.; Yoshine, M.; Shinchi, M.; Ojima, K.; Hirano, Y.; Katoh, S.; Iwasaki, M.; Surya Prakash, V.; Ichiyama, K.; Senthilkumar, R.; Preethy, S.; Abraham, S. J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555240\nBackgroundAutologous buccal mucosal tissue derived cell transplantation techniques in repairing a stricture inflicted male urethral epithelium have been evolving. There was not much of clarity on the cell type, in vitro culture methods and the mode of transplantation, until we reported our buccal epithelium expanded and encapsulated in scaffold-hybrid approach to urethral stricture (BEES-HAUS) clinical study yielding a successful engraftment and repair with a long-term patency. We herein report with technical clarity on the advantages of mixing two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultured fibroblast like cells and three dimensional (3D) thermo-reversible gelation polymer (TGP) cultured cells; the former secreting IGF-1, a cytokine known for its healing effects and the latter expressing epithelial surface markers in flow cytometry, both sourced from human buccal tissue, together transplanted using TGP as a carrier. MethodsHuman buccal tissues (n=22) redundant after urethroplasty surgery was used after informed consent and IEC approval. They were enzyme digested, divided into two portions; one was cultured as monolayer method (2D) and the other in 3D in TGP. Flowcytometry and quantification of IGF-1 in cell culture supernatant through the culture period were undertaken. ResultsIn flowcytometry, the cells on day 0, lacked AE1/AE3 - pancytokeratin expression indicative of epithelial phenotype of culture, which progressively increased in the 3D-TGP group, during invitro culture of up to 21 days. The 2D showed expression of only fibroblasts like cells that were negative for AE1/AE3 but positive for CD140b. IGF-1 secretion was significantly higher in 2D cultures than in 3D-TGP (p-value \u003c 0.05). ConclusionThe 3D- TGP cultured cells of epithelial nature and the 2D cultured fibroblast like cells secreting IGF-1, together when transplanted using TGP scaffold as a carrier, adapted to a hostile in vivo milieu after releasing the fibrous strands with urethrotomy, successfully engrafted and repaired a stricture-inflicted male urethral epithelium in the BEES-HAUS procedure. While this hybrid combination of cells are considered to have potential in managing other epithelial damages, further research of such hybrid combination and their behaviour in disease affected environments may help to expand this solution in regenerating and repairing other tissues and organs as well.

G.; Zhu, Z.; Intasian, P.; Jain, M.; Petrov, V. A.; Tan, S.-I.; Xun, G.; Zhao, H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556564\nThe CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in metabolic engineering and human gene therapy. However, locating the optimal site on the chromosome to integrate heterologous genes using the CRISPR/Cas system remains an open question. Selecting a suitable site for gene integration involves considering multiple complex criteria, including factors related to CRISPR/Cas-mediated integration, genetic stability, and gene expression. Consequently, identifying such sites on specific or different chromosomal locations typically requires extensive characterization efforts. To address these challenges, we have developed CRISPR-COPIES, a COmputational Pipeline for the Identification of CRISPR/Cas-facilitated intEgration Sites. This tool leverages ScaNN, a state-of-the-art model on the embedding-based nearest neighbor search for fast and accurate off-target search and can identify genome-wide intergenic sites for most bacterial and fungal genomes within minutes. As a proof of concept, we utilized CRISPR-COPIES to characterize neutral integration sites in three diverse species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cupriavidus necator, and a human cell line. In addition, we developed a user-friendly web interface for CRISPR-COPIES (https://biofoundry.web.illinois.edu/copies/). We anticipate that CRISPR-COPIES will serve as a valuable tool for targeted DNA integration and aid in the characterization of synthetic biology toolkits, enable rapid strain construction to produce valuable biochemicals and support human gene and cell therapy applications.\nA molecular proximity sensor based on an engineered, dual-component guide RNA\nAuthors: Choi, J.; Chen, W.; Liao, H.; Li, X.; Shendure, J.\nScore: 40.6, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553235\nOne of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.\nEngineering the ADDobody protein scaffold for generation of high-avidity ADDomer super-binders\nAuthors: Buzas, D.; Sun, H.; Toelzer, C.; Yadav, S. K. N.; Borucu, U.; Gautam, G.; Gupta, K.; Bufton, J.; Capin, J.; Sessions, R. B.; Garzoni, F.; Berger, I.; Schaffitzel, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.09.556966\nAdenovirus-derived dodecamer (ADDomer) nanoparticles comprise 60 copies of Adenovirus penton base protein (PBP). ADDomer is thermostable, rendering the storage, transport and deployment of ADDomer-based therapeutics independent of a cold-chain. To expand the scope of ADDomer nanoparticles for new applications, we engineered ADDobodies. ADDobodies represent the crown domain of the PBP, genetically separated from its multimerization domain. We inserted heterologous sequences into hyper-variable loops in the crown domain. The resulting ADDobodies were expressed at high yields in Escherichia coli, are monomeric and maintain thermostability. We solved the X-ray structure of an ADDobody prototype validating our design. We demonstrated that ADDobodies can be used to select a specific binder against a target in in vitro selection experiments using ribosome display, with an enrichment factor of ~104-fold in one selection round. We show that ADDobodies can be converted back into ADDomers by genetically reconnecting the selected ADDobody with the PBP multimerization domain from a different species, giving rise to a multivalent nanoparticle, called Chimera, confirmed by a 2.2 A structure determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Chimera comprises 60 binding sites, resulting in ultra-high, picomolar avidity to the target.\nAn emergent biosynthetic pathway to essential amino acids by metabolic metathesis\nAuthors: Rivollier, J.; Gosling, S.; Pezo, V.; Heck, M.-P.; MARLIERE, P.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556532\nAn experimental approach to implanting foreign chemical reactions into living cells is to select for the catalytic production of a vital building-block such as an amino acid. Alkene metathesis is unknown in extant biochemistry, but is emerging as a new type of reaction to be catalyzed by protein enzymes. Here we show how the alkenic amino acid vinylglycine can be generated in a biocompatible reaction from 5-allyloxy-2-amino-pent-3-enoate (APE) by ring-closing metathesis catalyzed by a standard Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. The vinylglycine produced in situ is then used as a precursor of isoleucine and methionine, thus allowing the growth of strains of Escherichia coli requiring these essential amino acids. The robust nutritional screen we have developed paves the way for the directed evolution of genetically encoded metathesis enzymes and the chemical elaboration of metathesis coenzymes.\nPrecise manipulation of site and stoichiometry of capsid modification enables optimization of functional adeno-associated virus conjugates\nAuthors: Erickson, S. B.; Pham, Q.; Cao, X.; Glicksman, J.; Kelemen, R. E.; Shahraeini, S. S.; Bodkin, S.; Kiyam, Z.; Chatterjee, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556719\nThe ability to engineer adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for targeted infection of specific cell types is critically important to fully harness its potential of human gene therapy. A promising approach to achieve this objective involves chemically attaching retargeting ligands onto the virus capsid. Site-specific incorporation of a bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) into the AAV capsid proteins provides a particularly attractive strategy to introduce such modifications with exquisite precision. In this study, we show that using ncAA mutagenesis, it is possible to systematically alter the attachment site of a retargeting ligand (cyclic-RGD) on the AAV capsid to create diverse conjugate architectures, and that the site of attachment heavily impacts the retargeting efficiency. We further demonstrate that the performance of these AAV conjugates is highly sensitive to the stoichiometry of capsid labeling (labels per capsid), with an intermediate labeling density (~12 per capsid) providing optimal activity. Finally, we developed technology to precisely control the number of attachment sites per AAV capsid, by selectively incorporating a ncAA into the minor capsid proteins with high fidelity and efficiency, such that AAV-conjugates with varying stoichiometry can be synthesized in a homogeneous manner. Together, this platform provides unparalleled control over site and stoichiometry of capsid modification, which will enable the development of next-generation AAV vectors tailored with desirable attributes.\nUltralow background membrane editors for spatiotemporal control of lipid metabolism and signaling\nAuthors: Li, X.-L.; Tei, R.; Uematsu, M.; Baskin, J. M.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555787\nPhosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a LOV domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and non-perturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.

        <p class="abstract">The ubiquity of genetic interactions in living cells challenges the concept of parts orthogonality, which is a cornerstone of synthetic biology. Parts, such as heterologously expressed genes, draw from shared pools of limited cellular resources and interactions between parts themselves and their host are inevitable. Instead of trying to eliminate or disregard these interactions, we propose to leverage them to promote desirable phenotypes. We recently described CRI-SPA, a method for high-throughput genome-wide gene delivery and screening of host:pathway interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we combine this method with biosensor-based high-throughput screening and high-density colony image analysis to identify lead engineering targets for optimising cis-cis-muconic acid (CCM) production in yeast cell factories. Using the biosensor screen, we phenotype &gt;9,700 genotypes for their interaction with the heterologously expressed CCM biosynthesis pathway, including both gene knock-out and overexpression, and identify novel metabolic targets belonging to sulphur assimilation and methionine synthesis, as well as cellular redox homeostasis, positively impacting CCM biosynthesis by up to 280%. Our genome-wide exploration of host pathway interaction opens novel strategies for the metabolic engineering of yeast cell factories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAutologous buccal mucosal tissue derived cell transplantation techniques in repairing a stricture inflicted male urethral epithelium have been evolving. There was not much of clarity on the cell type, in vitro culture methods and the mode of transplantation, until we reported our buccal epithelium expanded and encapsulated in scaffold-hybrid approach to urethral stricture (BEES-HAUS) clinical study yielding a successful engraftment and repair with a long-term patency. We herein report with technical clarity on the advantages of mixing two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultured fibroblast like cells and three dimensional (3D) thermo-reversible gelation polymer (TGP) cultured cells; the former secreting IGF-1, a cytokine known for its healing effects and the latter expressing epithelial surface markers in flow cytometry, both sourced from human buccal tissue, together transplanted using TGP as a carrier.

MethodsHuman buccal tissues (n=22) redundant after urethroplasty surgery was used after informed consent and IEC approval. They were enzyme digested, divided into two portions; one was cultured as monolayer method (2D) and the other in 3D in TGP. Flowcytometry and quantification of IGF-1 in cell culture supernatant through the culture period were undertaken.

ResultsIn flowcytometry, the cells on day 0, lacked AE1/AE3 - pancytokeratin expression indicative of epithelial phenotype of culture, which progressively increased in the 3D-TGP group, during invitro culture of up to 21 days. The 2D showed expression of only fibroblasts like cells that were negative for AE1/AE3 but positive for CD140b. IGF-1 secretion was significantly higher in 2D cultures than in 3D-TGP (p-value &lt; 0.05).

ConclusionThe 3D- TGP cultured cells of epithelial nature and the 2D cultured fibroblast like cells secreting IGF-1, together when transplanted using TGP scaffold as a carrier, adapted to a hostile in vivo milieu after releasing the fibrous strands with urethrotomy, successfully engrafted and repaired a stricture-inflicted male urethral epithelium in the BEES-HAUS procedure. While this hybrid combination of cells are considered to have potential in managing other epithelial damages, further research of such hybrid combination and their behaviour in disease affected environments may help to expand this solution in regenerating and repairing other tissues and organs as well.

        <p class="abstract">The CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in metabolic engineering and human gene therapy. However, locating the optimal site on the chromosome to integrate heterologous genes using the CRISPR/Cas system remains an open question. Selecting a suitable site for gene integration involves considering multiple complex criteria, including factors related to CRISPR/Cas-mediated integration, genetic stability, and gene expression. Consequently, identifying such sites on specific or different chromosomal locations typically requires extensive characterization efforts. To address these challenges, we have developed CRISPR-COPIES, a COmputational Pipeline for the Identification of CRISPR/Cas-facilitated intEgration Sites. This tool leverages ScaNN, a state-of-the-art model on the embedding-based nearest neighbor search for fast and accurate off-target search and can identify genome-wide intergenic sites for most bacterial and fungal genomes within minutes. As a proof of concept, we utilized CRISPR-COPIES to characterize neutral integration sites in three diverse species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cupriavidus necator, and a human cell line. In addition, we developed a user-friendly web interface for CRISPR-COPIES (https://biofoundry.web.illinois.edu/copies/). We anticipate that CRISPR-COPIES will serve as a valuable tool for targeted DNA integration and aid in the characterization of synthetic biology toolkits, enable rapid strain construction to produce valuable biochemicals and support human gene and cell therapy applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. Such circuits bridge the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a strategy termed P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically-induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adenovirus-derived dodecamer (ADDomer) nanoparticles comprise 60 copies of Adenovirus penton base protein (PBP). ADDomer is thermostable, rendering the storage, transport and deployment of ADDomer-based therapeutics independent of a cold-chain. To expand the scope of ADDomer nanoparticles for new applications, we engineered ADDobodies. ADDobodies represent the crown domain of the PBP, genetically separated from its multimerization domain. We inserted heterologous sequences into hyper-variable loops in the crown domain. The resulting ADDobodies were expressed at high yields in Escherichia coli, are monomeric and maintain thermostability. We solved the X-ray structure of an ADDobody prototype validating our design. We demonstrated that ADDobodies can be used to select a specific binder against a target in in vitro selection experiments using ribosome display, with an enrichment factor of ~104-fold in one selection round. We show that ADDobodies can be converted back into ADDomers by genetically reconnecting the selected ADDobody with the PBP multimerization domain from a different species, giving rise to a multivalent nanoparticle, called Chimera, confirmed by a 2.2 A structure determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Chimera comprises 60 binding sites, resulting in ultra-high, picomolar avidity to the target.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An experimental approach to implanting foreign chemical reactions into living cells is to select for the catalytic production of a vital building-block such as an amino acid. Alkene metathesis is unknown in extant biochemistry, but is emerging as a new type of reaction to be catalyzed by protein enzymes. Here we show how the alkenic amino acid vinylglycine can be generated in a biocompatible reaction from 5-allyloxy-2-amino-pent-3-enoate (APE) by ring-closing metathesis catalyzed by a standard Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. The vinylglycine produced in situ is then used as a precursor of isoleucine and methionine, thus allowing the growth of strains of Escherichia coli requiring these essential amino acids. The robust nutritional screen we have developed paves the way for the directed evolution of genetically encoded metathesis enzymes and the chemical elaboration of metathesis coenzymes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to engineer adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for targeted infection of specific cell types is critically important to fully harness its potential of human gene therapy. A promising approach to achieve this objective involves chemically attaching retargeting ligands onto the virus capsid. Site-specific incorporation of a bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) into the AAV capsid proteins provides a particularly attractive strategy to introduce such modifications with exquisite precision. In this study, we show that using ncAA mutagenesis, it is possible to systematically alter the attachment site of a retargeting ligand (cyclic-RGD) on the AAV capsid to create diverse conjugate architectures, and that the site of attachment heavily impacts the retargeting efficiency. We further demonstrate that the performance of these AAV conjugates is highly sensitive to the stoichiometry of capsid labeling (labels per capsid), with an intermediate labeling density (~12 per capsid) providing optimal activity. Finally, we developed technology to precisely control the number of attachment sites per AAV capsid, by selectively incorporating a ncAA into the minor capsid proteins with high fidelity and efficiency, such that AAV-conjugates with varying stoichiometry can be synthesized in a homogeneous manner. Together, this platform provides unparalleled control over site and stoichiometry of capsid modification, which will enable the development of next-generation AAV vectors tailored with desirable attributes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a LOV domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and non-perturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.
