A.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572500\nTransmembrane {beta}-barrels (TMBs) are widely used for single molecule DNA and RNA sequencing and have considerable potential for a broad range of sensing and sequencing applications. Current engineering approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally occurring channels such as CsgG, which have evolved to carry out functions very different from sensing, and hence provide sub-optimal starting points. In contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to the design of transmembrane {beta}-barrel pores with different diameter and pore geometry. NMR and crystallographic characterization shows that the designs are stably folded with structures close to the design models. We report the first examples of de novo designed TMBs with 10, 12 and 14 stranded {beta}-barrels. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 pS ([~]0.5 nm pore diameter) to 430 pS ([~]1.1 nm pore diameter), and can be converted into sensitive small-molecule sensors with high signal to noise ratio. The capability to generate on demand {beta}-barrel pores of defined geometry opens up fundamentally new opportunities for custom engineering of sequencing and sensing technologies. One sentence summaryDe novo design enables the generation of stable and quite transmembrane beta-barrel nanopores with tailored sizes, shapes and properties.\nBuilding synthetic biosensors using red blood cell proteins\nAuthors: Dolberg, T. B.; Gunnels, T. F.; Ling, T.; Sarnese, K. A.; Crispino, J. D.; Leonard, J. N.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.571988\nAs the use of engineered cell therapies expands from pioneering efforts in cancer immunotherapy to other applications, an attractive but less explored approach is the use of engineered red blood cells (RBCs). Compared to other cells, RBCs have a very long circulation time and reside in the blood compartment, so they could be ideally suited for applications as sentinel cells that enable in situ sensing and diagnostics. However, we largely lack tools for converting RBCs into biosensors. A unique challenge is that RBCs remodel their membranes during maturation, shedding many membrane components, suggesting that an RBC-specific approach may be needed. Towards addressing this need, here we develop a biosensing architecture built on RBC membrane proteins that are retained through erythropoiesis. This biosensor employs a mechanism in which extracellular ligand binding is transduced into intracellular reconstitution of a split output protein (including either a fluorophore or an enzyme). By comparatively evaluating a range of biosensor architectures, linker types, scaffold choices, and output signals, we identify biosensor designs and design features that confer substantial ligand-induced signal in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that erythroid precursor cells engineered with our RBC protein biosensors function in vivo. This study establishes a foundation for developing RBC-based biosensors that could ultimately address unmet needs including non-invasive monitoring of physiological signals for a range of diagnostic applications.\nInverse folding of protein complexes with a structure-informed language model enables unsupervised antibody evolution\nAuthors: Shanker, V. R.; Bruun, T. U. J.; Hie, B. L.; Kim, P. S.\nScore: 17.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572475\nLarge language models trained on sequence information alone are capable of learning high level principles of protein design. However, beyond sequence, the three-dimensional structures of proteins determine their specific function, activity, and evolvability. Here we show that a general protein language model augmented with protein structure backbone coordinates and trained on the inverse folding problem can guide evolution for diverse proteins without needing to explicitly model individual functional tasks. We demonstrate inverse folding to be an effective unsupervised, structure-based sequence optimization strategy that also generalizes to multimeric complexes by implicitly learning features of binding and amino acid epistasis. Using this approach, we screened ~30 variants of two therapeutic clinical antibodies used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and achieved up to 26-fold improvement in neutralization and 37-fold improvement in affinity against antibody-escaped viral variants-of-concern BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively. In addition to substantial overall improvements in protein function, we find inverse folding performs with leading experimental success rates among other reported machine learning-guided directed evolution methods, without requiring any task-specific training data.\nContinual improvement of multiplex mutagenesis in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Develtere, W.; Decaestecker, W.; Rombaut, D.; Anders, C.; Clicque, E.; Vuylsteke, M.; Jacobs, T. B.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572307\nCRISPR/Cas9 is currently the most powerful tool to generate mutations in plant genomes and more efficient tools are needed as the scale of experiments increases. In the model plant Arabidopsis, the choice of promoter driving Cas9 expression is critical to generate germline mutations. Several optimal promoters have been reported. However, it is unclear which promoter is ideal as they have not been thoroughly tested side-by-side. Furthermore, most plant vectors still use one of the two Cas9 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) configurations initially reported and can still be optimized. We genotyped more than 6,000 Arabidopsis T2 plants to test seven promoters and eleven NLS architectures across 14 targets to systematically improve the generation of single and multiplex inheritable mutations. We find that the RPS5A promoter and double-BP NLS architecture were individually the most efficient components. When combined, 99% of T2 plant contained at least one knockout mutation and 84% contained 4-7-plex knock-outs. These optimizations will be useful to generate higher-order knockouts in the germline of Arabidopsis and likely be applicable to other CRISPR systems as well.\nA long-acting prolactin to combat lactation insufficiency\nAuthors: Kready, K.; Doiron, K.; Redfield Chan, K.; Way, J. C.; Justman, Q.; Powe, C. E.; Silver, P. A.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571886\nHuman infants are born to breastfeed. While 50% of lactating persons struggle to make enough milk, there are no governmentally-approved drugs to enhance lactation1. Here, we engineer a variant of the naturally-occurring driver of lactation, the hormone Prolactin, to increase its serum half-life and produce a viable drug candidate. Our engineered variant, Prolactin-eXtra Long-acting (Prolactin-XL), is comprised of endogenously active human prolactin fused to an engineered human IgG Fc domain designed to overcome the unique drug development challenges specific to the lactating person-infant dyad. Our Prolactin-XL has a serum half-life of 70.9h in mice, 2,625-fold longer than endogenously active prolactin alone (70.9h v. 0.027h). We demonstrate that Prolactin-XL increases milk production and restores growth of pups fed by dams with pharmacologically-ablated lactation. We show that Prolactin-XL-enhanced lactation is accompanied by reversible, lactocyte-driven changes in mammary gland morphology. This work establishes long-acting prolactins as a potentially powerful pharmacologic means to combat insufficient lactation.\nIdentifying functional multi-host shuttle plasmids to advance synthetic biology applications in Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium\nAuthors: Meaney, J. S.; Panchal, A. K.; Wilcox, A. J.; diCenzo, G. C.; Karas, B. J.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572671\nAmmonia availability has a crucial role in agriculture as it ensures healthy plant growth and increased crop yields. Since diazotrophs are the only organisms capable of reducing dinitrogen to ammonium, they have a great ecological importance and potential to mitigate the environmental and economic costs of synthetic fertilizer use. Rhizobia are especially valuable being that they can engage in nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships with legumes, and they demonstrate great diversity and plasticity in genomic and phenotypic traits. However, few rhizobial species have improved genetic tractability for synthetic biology applications. This study established a basic genetic toolbox with antibiotic resistance markers, multi-host shuttle plasmids and a streamlined protocol for biparental conjugation with Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species. We identified two repABC origins of replication from Sinorhizobium meliloti (pSymB) and Rhizobium etli (p42d) that were stable across all three strains of interest. Furthermore, the NZP2235 genome was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis determined its reclassification to Mesorhizobium huakuii. These tools will enable the use of plasmid-based strategies for more advanced genetic engineering projects and ultimately contribute towards the development of more sustainable agriculture practices by means of novel nitrogen-fixing organelles, elite bioinoculants or symbiotic association with non-legumes.\nAutotrophic growth of E. coli is achieved by a small number of genetic changes\nAuthors: Ben Nissan, R.; Milshtein, E.; Pahl, V.; de Pins, B.; Jona, G.; Levi, D.; Yung, H.; Nir, N.; Ezra, D.; Gleizer, S.; Link, H.; Noor, E.; Milo, R.\nScore: 63.9, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.03.543535\nSynthetic autotrophy is a promising avenue to sustainable bioproduction from CO2. Here, we use iterative laboratory evolution to generate several distinct autotrophic strains. Utilising this genetic diversity, we identify that just three mutations are sufficient for E. coli to grow autotrophically, when introduced alongside non-native energy (formate dehydrogenase) and carbon-fixing (RuBisCO, phosphoribulokinase, carbonic anhydrase) modules. The mutated genes are involved in glycolysis (pgi), central-carbon regulation (crp), and RNA transcription (rpoB). The pgi mutation reduces the enzymes activity, thereby stabilising the carbon-fixing cycle by capping a major branching flux. For the other two mutations, we observe down-regulation of several metabolic pathways and increased expression of native genes associated with the carbon-fixing module (rpiB) and the energy module (fdoGH), as well as an increased ratio of NADH/NAD+ - the cycles electron-donor. This study demonstrates the malleability of metabolism and its capacity to switch trophic modes using only a small number of genetic changes and could facilitate transforming other heterotrophic organisms into autotrophs.\nCell surface sculpting using logic-gated protein actuators\nAuthors: Kofoed, C.; Tay, N. E. S.; Ye, X.; Erkalo, G.; Muir, T. W.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572113\nCell differentiation and tissue specialization lead to unique cellular surface landscapes and exacerbated or loss of expression patterns can result in further heterogenicity distinctive of pathological phenotypes1-3. Immunotherapies and emerging protein therapeutics seek to exploit such differences by engaging cell populations selectively based on their surface markers. Since a single surface antigen rarely defines a specific cell type4,5, the development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is highly desirable. Here, we describe an autonomous decision-making protein device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive fragments. We show that this protein actuator platform can perform various Boolean logic operations on cell surfaces, allowing highly selective recruitment of enzymatic and cytotoxic activities to specific cells within mixed populations. Due to its intrinsic modularity and tunability, this technology is expected to be compatible with different types of inputs, targeting modalities and functional outputs, and as such will have broad application in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas.\nIn vitro validated antibody design against multiple therapeutic antigens using generative inverse folding\nAuthors: Shanehsazzadeh, A.; Alverio, J.; Kasun, G.; Levine, S.; Khan, J.

R.; Bachas, S.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2023-12-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570889\nDeep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to design protein sequences given backbone structures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. While these approaches have been applied in silico to designing antibody complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), they have yet to be validated in vitro for designing antibody binders, which is the true measure of success for antibody design. Here we describe IgDesign, a deep learning method for antibody CDR design, and demonstrate its robustness with successful binder design for 8 therapeutic antigens. The model is tasked with designing heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) or all three heavy chain CDRs (HCDR123) using native backbone structures of antibody-antigen complexes, along with the antigen and antibody framework (FWR) sequences as context. For each of the 8 antigens, we design 100 HCDR3s and 100 HCDR123s, scaffold them into the native antibodys variable region, and screen them for binding against the antigen using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As a baseline, we screen 100 HCDR3s taken from the models training set and paired with the native HCDR1 and HCDR2. We observe that both HCDR3 design and HCDR123 design outperform this HCDR3-only baseline. IgDesign is the first experimentally validated antibody inverse folding model. It can design antibody binders to multiple therapeutic antigens with high success rates and, in some cases, improved affinities over clinically validated reference antibodies. Antibody inverse folding has applications to both de novo antibody design and lead optimization, making IgDesign a valuable tool for accelerating drug development and enabling therapeutic design.\nGenetic modification strategies for electroporation and CRISPR-Cas-based technologies in the non-competent Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5\nAuthors: Ishikawa, M.; Hori, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572688\nEnvironmental isolates are promising candidates for new chassis of synthetic biology because of their inherent conversion capabilities and resilience to environmental stresses; however, many remain genetically intractable and unamenable to established genetic tools tailored for model bacteria. Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 possesses intriguing properties for use in synthetic biology applications. However, genetic manipulation via electroporation is hindered by its low transformation efficiency. This study demonstrated the genetic refinement of the Tol 5 strain, achieving efficient transformation via electroporation. We deleted two genes encoding restriction enzymes. The resulting mutant strain not only exhibited marked efficiency of electrotransformation but also proved receptive to both in vitro and in vivo DNA assembly technologies, thereby facilitating the construction of recombinant DNA. In addition, we successfully adapted a CRISPR-Cas9-based base-editing platform developed for other Acinetobacter species. Our genetic modification strategy allows for the domestication of non-model bacteria, streamlining their utilization in synthetic biology applications.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Transmembrane {beta}-barrels (TMBs) are widely used for single molecule DNA and RNA sequencing and have considerable potential for a broad range of sensing and sequencing applications. Current engineering approaches for nanopore sensors are limited to naturally occurring channels such as CsgG, which have evolved to carry out functions very different from sensing, and hence provide sub-optimal starting points. In contrast, de novo protein design can in principle create an unlimited number of new nanopores with any desired properties. Here we describe a general approach to the design of transmembrane {beta}-barrel pores with different diameter and pore geometry. NMR and crystallographic characterization shows that the designs are stably folded with structures close to the design models. We report the first examples of de novo designed TMBs with 10, 12 and 14 stranded {beta}-barrels. The designs have distinct conductances that correlate with their pore diameter, ranging from 110 pS ([~]0.5 nm pore diameter) to 430 pS ([~]1.1 nm pore diameter), and can be converted into sensitive small-molecule sensors with high signal to noise ratio. The capability to generate on demand {beta}-barrel pores of defined geometry opens up fundamentally new opportunities for custom engineering of sequencing and sensing technologies.

One sentence summaryDe novo design enables the generation of stable and quite transmembrane beta-barrel nanopores with tailored sizes, shapes and properties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As the use of engineered cell therapies expands from pioneering efforts in cancer immunotherapy to other applications, an attractive but less explored approach is the use of engineered red blood cells (RBCs). Compared to other cells, RBCs have a very long circulation time and reside in the blood compartment, so they could be ideally suited for applications as sentinel cells that enable in situ sensing and diagnostics. However, we largely lack tools for converting RBCs into biosensors. A unique challenge is that RBCs remodel their membranes during maturation, shedding many membrane components, suggesting that an RBC-specific approach may be needed. Towards addressing this need, here we develop a biosensing architecture built on RBC membrane proteins that are retained through erythropoiesis. This biosensor employs a mechanism in which extracellular ligand binding is transduced into intracellular reconstitution of a split output protein (including either a fluorophore or an enzyme). By comparatively evaluating a range of biosensor architectures, linker types, scaffold choices, and output signals, we identify biosensor designs and design features that confer substantial ligand-induced signal in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that erythroid precursor cells engineered with our RBC protein biosensors function in vivo. This study establishes a foundation for developing RBC-based biosensors that could ultimately address unmet needs including non-invasive monitoring of physiological signals for a range of diagnostic applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Large language models trained on sequence information alone are capable of learning high level principles of protein design. However, beyond sequence, the three-dimensional structures of proteins determine their specific function, activity, and evolvability. Here we show that a general protein language model augmented with protein structure backbone coordinates and trained on the inverse folding problem can guide evolution for diverse proteins without needing to explicitly model individual functional tasks. We demonstrate inverse folding to be an effective unsupervised, structure-based sequence optimization strategy that also generalizes to multimeric complexes by implicitly learning features of binding and amino acid epistasis. Using this approach, we screened ~30 variants of two therapeutic clinical antibodies used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and achieved up to 26-fold improvement in neutralization and 37-fold improvement in affinity against antibody-escaped viral variants-of-concern BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively. In addition to substantial overall improvements in protein function, we find inverse folding performs with leading experimental success rates among other reported machine learning-guided directed evolution methods, without requiring any task-specific training data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR/Cas9 is currently the most powerful tool to generate mutations in plant genomes and more efficient tools are needed as the scale of experiments increases. In the model plant Arabidopsis, the choice of promoter driving Cas9 expression is critical to generate germline mutations. Several optimal promoters have been reported. However, it is unclear which promoter is ideal as they have not been thoroughly tested side-by-side. Furthermore, most plant vectors still use one of the two Cas9 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) configurations initially reported and can still be optimized. We genotyped more than 6,000 Arabidopsis T2 plants to test seven promoters and eleven NLS architectures across 14 targets to systematically improve the generation of single and multiplex inheritable mutations. We find that the RPS5A promoter and double-BP NLS architecture were individually the most efficient components. When combined, 99% of T2 plant contained at least one knockout mutation and 84% contained 4-7-plex knock-outs. These optimizations will be useful to generate higher-order knockouts in the germline of Arabidopsis and likely be applicable to other CRISPR systems as well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human infants are born to breastfeed. While 50% of lactating persons struggle to make enough milk, there are no governmentally-approved drugs to enhance lactation1. Here, we engineer a variant of the naturally-occurring driver of lactation, the hormone Prolactin, to increase its serum half-life and produce a viable drug candidate. Our engineered variant, Prolactin-eXtra Long-acting (Prolactin-XL), is comprised of endogenously active human prolactin fused to an engineered human IgG Fc domain designed to overcome the unique drug development challenges specific to the lactating person-infant dyad. Our Prolactin-XL has a serum half-life of 70.9h in mice, 2,625-fold longer than endogenously active prolactin alone (70.9h v. 0.027h). We demonstrate that Prolactin-XL increases milk production and restores growth of pups fed by dams with pharmacologically-ablated lactation. We show that Prolactin-XL-enhanced lactation is accompanied by reversible, lactocyte-driven changes in mammary gland morphology. This work establishes long-acting prolactins as a potentially powerful pharmacologic means to combat insufficient lactation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ammonia availability has a crucial role in agriculture as it ensures healthy plant growth and increased crop yields. Since diazotrophs are the only organisms capable of reducing dinitrogen to ammonium, they have a great ecological importance and potential to mitigate the environmental and economic costs of synthetic fertilizer use. Rhizobia are especially valuable being that they can engage in nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships with legumes, and they demonstrate great diversity and plasticity in genomic and phenotypic traits. However, few rhizobial species have improved genetic tractability for synthetic biology applications. This study established a basic genetic toolbox with antibiotic resistance markers, multi-host shuttle plasmids and a streamlined protocol for biparental conjugation with Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species. We identified two repABC origins of replication from Sinorhizobium meliloti (pSymB) and Rhizobium etli (p42d) that were stable across all three strains of interest. Furthermore, the NZP2235 genome was sequenced and phylogenetic analysis determined its reclassification to Mesorhizobium huakuii. These tools will enable the use of plasmid-based strategies for more advanced genetic engineering projects and ultimately contribute towards the development of more sustainable agriculture practices by means of novel nitrogen-fixing organelles, elite bioinoculants or symbiotic association with non-legumes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Synthetic autotrophy is a promising avenue to sustainable bioproduction from CO2. Here, we use iterative laboratory evolution to generate several distinct autotrophic strains. Utilising this genetic diversity, we identify that just three mutations are sufficient for E. coli to grow autotrophically, when introduced alongside non-native energy (formate dehydrogenase) and carbon-fixing (RuBisCO, phosphoribulokinase, carbonic anhydrase) modules. The mutated genes are involved in glycolysis (pgi), central-carbon regulation (crp), and RNA transcription (rpoB). The pgi mutation reduces the enzymes activity, thereby stabilising the carbon-fixing cycle by capping a major branching flux. For the other two mutations, we observe down-regulation of several metabolic pathways and increased expression of native genes associated with the carbon-fixing module (rpiB) and the energy module (fdoGH), as well as an increased ratio of NADH/NAD&#43; - the cycles electron-donor. This study demonstrates the malleability of metabolism and its capacity to switch trophic modes using only a small number of genetic changes and could facilitate transforming other heterotrophic organisms into autotrophs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell differentiation and tissue specialization lead to unique cellular surface landscapes and exacerbated or loss of expression patterns can result in further heterogenicity distinctive of pathological phenotypes1-3. Immunotherapies and emerging protein therapeutics seek to exploit such differences by engaging cell populations selectively based on their surface markers. Since a single surface antigen rarely defines a specific cell type4,5, the development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is highly desirable. Here, we describe an autonomous decision-making protein device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive fragments. We show that this protein actuator platform can perform various Boolean logic operations on cell surfaces, allowing highly selective recruitment of enzymatic and cytotoxic activities to specific cells within mixed populations. Due to its intrinsic modularity and tunability, this technology is expected to be compatible with different types of inputs, targeting modalities and functional outputs, and as such will have broad application in the synthetic biology and biotechnology areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to design protein sequences given backbone structures [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. While these approaches have been applied in silico to designing antibody complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), they have yet to be validated in vitro for designing antibody binders, which is the true measure of success for antibody design. Here we describe IgDesign, a deep learning method for antibody CDR design, and demonstrate its robustness with successful binder design for 8 therapeutic antigens. The model is tasked with designing heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) or all three heavy chain CDRs (HCDR123) using native backbone structures of antibody-antigen complexes, along with the antigen and antibody framework (FWR) sequences as context. For each of the 8 antigens, we design 100 HCDR3s and 100 HCDR123s, scaffold them into the native antibodys variable region, and screen them for binding against the antigen using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As a baseline, we screen 100 HCDR3s taken from the models training set and paired with the native HCDR1 and HCDR2. We observe that both HCDR3 design and HCDR123 design outperform this HCDR3-only baseline. IgDesign is the first experimentally validated antibody inverse folding model. It can design antibody binders to multiple therapeutic antigens with high success rates and, in some cases, improved affinities over clinically validated reference antibodies. Antibody inverse folding has applications to both de novo antibody design and lead optimization, making IgDesign a valuable tool for accelerating drug development and enabling therapeutic design.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental isolates are promising candidates for new chassis of synthetic biology because of their inherent conversion capabilities and resilience to environmental stresses; however, many remain genetically intractable and unamenable to established genetic tools tailored for model bacteria. Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 possesses intriguing properties for use in synthetic biology applications. However, genetic manipulation via electroporation is hindered by its low transformation efficiency. This study demonstrated the genetic refinement of the Tol 5 strain, achieving efficient transformation via electroporation. We deleted two genes encoding restriction enzymes. The resulting mutant strain not only exhibited marked efficiency of electrotransformation but also proved receptive to both in vitro and in vivo DNA assembly technologies, thereby facilitating the construction of recombinant DNA. In addition, we successfully adapted a CRISPR-Cas9-based base-editing platform developed for other Acinetobacter species. Our genetic modification strategy allows for the domestication of non-model bacteria, streamlining their utilization in synthetic biology applications.</p>
