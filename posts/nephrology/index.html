L.; Huang, K.; Ye, J.; Nitsch, D.; Saleem, M.; Bockenhauer, D.; Bramham, K.; Gale, D. P.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.23296009\nRare kidney diseases are not well characterised, despite making a significant contribution to the burden of kidney disease globally. The National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR) collects longitudinal disease and treatment related data from people living with rare kidney diseases across the UK, and is the largest rare kidney disease registry in the world. We present the clinical demographics and renal function of 25,880 prevalent patients and evaluate for any potential recruitment bias to RaDaR. RaDaR recruits patients from 108 UK hospitals and is linked with the UK Renal Registry (UKRR, with which all UK patients receiving Kidney Replacement Therapy (KRT) are registered). To assess for recruitment bias to RaDaR we performed three comparisons of ethnicity and socioeconomic status: 1) All prevalent RaDaR patients receiving KRT were compared with patients with eligible rare disease diagnoses receiving KRT in the UKRR 2) Patients recruited to RaDaR and all eligible unrecruited patients at two renal centres were compared 3) The age-stratified ethnicity distribution RaDaR patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) was compared with the English Census. We observed over-representation of individuals reporting South Asian ethnicity in some rare diseases (most markedly Cystinosis and Primary Hyperoxaluria). We found no evidence of systematic bias in recruitment to RaDaR in terms of ethnicity or social deprivation. Predominant rare kidney diseases in adults ([\u0026ge;]18 years) were ADPKD (29.2%), Vasculitis (15.8%) and IgA nephropathy (15.7%), compared to Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (43.6%), Vasculitis (10.8%) and Alport Syndrome (5.9%) in children (\u003c18 years). Compared with either adults recruited to RaDaR or the general UK population, children recruited to RaDaR were more likely to be of Asian ethnicity and live in more socially deprived areas. Lay SummaryRare kidney diseases make a significant contribution to the number of people living with kidney disease globally: \u003e25% of adults and \u003e50% of children with kidney failure have a rare disease. However, there is a lack of high-quality published data on how these conditions present, and in which patient groups. Patients often face delays in diagnosis and lack of reliable information on their condition once diagnosed. The UK National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR) was formed in 2010 to address this knowledge gap. It collects long-term data for UK patients with rare kidney conditions, and is the largest rare kidney disease registry in the world. Here, we present information about 25,880 adults and children recruited to RaDaR, including ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and kidney function, and investigate whether there is any bias in recruitment to RaDaR. To our knowledge, this is the largest epidemiological description of rare kidney diseases worldwide.\nCell Catcher: a new method to extract and preserve live renal cells from urine.\nAuthors: Nazmutdinova, K.; Man, C. Y.; Carter, M.; Beales, P. L.; Winyard, P. J.; Walsh, S. B.; Price, K. L.; Long, D. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.23295442\nPatient-specific urine-derived cells are valuable tools for biomedical research and personalised medicine since collection is non-invasive and easily repeated, unlike biopsies. The full potential of urine-derived cells remains untapped, however, due to the short shelf life of samples and necessity for prompt centrifugation. This study aims to address this limitation by evaluating a novel filtration-based Cell Catcher device and comparing its efficiency to centrifugation. We obtained urine from 18 tubulopathy patients and using paired analysis demonstrated that the Cell Catcher device significantly improves the success rate of isolating viable renal cells, and the cell yield. The findings were confirmed in a second independent study, using 44 samples obtained from healthy controls or patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome or tubulopathies, where colonies were established in 90% of the Cell Catcher-processed samples. Cultured cells displayed a variety of morphologies and expressed markers of podocyte and proximal tubule cells. Collectively, we describe an improved, point-of-care methodology to obtain live patient cells from urine using a filtration technique, with potential personalised medicine applications in nephrology, regenerative medicine, and urological cancers.\n",
