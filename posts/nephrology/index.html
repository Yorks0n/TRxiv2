However, how variations in PCC affect ACP participation remain unclear. Therefore, we examined variations in PCC across facilities and examined the association between PCC and ACP participation. Study Design: Multicenter cross-sectional study. Setting \u0026 Participants: Japanese adults receiving outpatient hemodialysis at six dialysis centers. Exposures: PCC was measured using the 13-item Japanese version of the Primary Care Assessment Tool-short form. Outcome: ACP participation as defined by discussion with the attending physician or written documentation or notes regarding treatment preferences. Analytical Approach: A general linear model was used to examine the correlates of the quality of PCC. Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the associations of ACP participation. Results: A total of 453 individuals were analyzed; 26.3% participated in ACP. Compared to respondents with no usual source of care (USC), higher PCC was associated with greater ACP participation in a dose-response manner (vs. no USC, adjusted prevalence ratios for the first to fourth quartiles: 1.36, 2.31, 2.64, and 3.10, respectively). Among the PCC sub-domains, first contact, longitudinality, comprehensiveness (services provided), and community orientation were particularly associated with ACP participation. There was a maximum of 12.0 points of facility variation in the quality of PCC. Limitations: Possible reverse causation and unmeasured confounders. Conclusions: High PCC quality was associated with ACP participation. The substantial disparity in PCC between facilities provides an opportunity to revisit the quality improvement in PCC.\nLUPUS NEPHRITIS SUBTYPE CLASSIFICATION WITH ONLY SLIDE LEVEL LABELS\nAuthors: Sharma, A.; Chauhan, E.; Uppin, M. S.; Liza, R.; Jawahar, C. V.; Vinod, P. K.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.23299357\nLupus Nephritis classification has historically relied on labor-intensive and meticulous glomerular-level labeling of renal structures in whole slide images (WSIs). However, this approach presents a formidable challenge due to its tedious and resource-intensive nature, limiting its scalability and practicality in clinical settings. In response to this challenge, our work introduces a novel methodology that utilizes only slide-level labels, eliminating the need for granular glomerular-level labeling. A comprehensive multi-stained lupus nephritis digital histopathology WSI dataset was created from the Indian population, which is the largest of its kind. LupusNet, a deep learning MIL-based model, was developed for subtype classification of LN. The results underscore its effectiveness, achieving an AUC score of 91.0%, an F1-score of 77.3%, and an accuracy of 81.1% on our dataset in distinguishing membranous and diffused classes of LN.\n",
