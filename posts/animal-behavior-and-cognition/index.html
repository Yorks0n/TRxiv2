In spite of the thermodynamic constraints on biology, some animals have evolved to live and move in extremely cold environments. Here, we investigate behavioral mechanisms of cold tolerance in the snow fly (Chionea spp.), a flightless crane fly that is active throughout the winter in boreal and alpine environments of the northern hemisphere. Using thermal imaging, we show that adult snow flies maintain the ability to walk down to an average body temperature of -7 {degrees}C. At this supercooling limit, ice crystallization occurs within the snow flys hemolymph and rapidly spreads throughout the body, resulting in death. However, we discovered that snow flies frequently survive freezing by rapidly amputating legs before ice crystallization can spread to their vital organs. Self-amputation of freezing limbs is a last-ditch tactic to prolong survival in frigid conditions that few animals can endure. Understanding the extreme physiology and behavior of snow insects is urgently important, as the alpine ecosystems they inhabit are being disproportionately altered by anthropogenic climate change.\nA model-based hypothesis framework to define and estimate the diel niche via the 'Diel.Niche' R package\nAuthors: Gerber, B. D.; Devarajan, K.; Farris, Z. J.; Fidino, M.\nScore: 25.5, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545898\nO_LIHow animals use the diel period (24-hour light-dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes. C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime). C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available. C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators. C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

A.; Cecchetti, G.; Ericson, P.; Cano, E.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546175\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music \"to keep them company\"; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear. In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages. Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants' descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants' imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.\nEndocannabinoid system modulation alters fine motor behavior in mice: insights from 3D motion capture\nAuthors: Ignatowska-Jankowska, B. M.; Gurkan Ozer, A.; Kuck, A.; Niphakis, M. J.; Ogasawara, D.; Cravatt, B. F.; Uusisaari, M. Y.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546437\nThe neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is the inhibition of locomotor activity. However, the behavioral effects of endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.\nIntent matters: how flow \u0026 forms of information impact collective navigation\nAuthors: Hodgson, T. M.; Johnston, S. T.; Ottobre, M.; Painter, K. J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.545920\nThe phenomenon of collective navigation has received considerable interest in recent years. A common line of thinking, backed by theoretical studies, is that collective navigation can improve navigation efficiency through the 'many-wrongs' principle, whereby individual error is reduced by comparing the headings of neighbours. When navigation takes place in a flowing environment, each individual's trajectory is influenced by drift. Accordingly a potential discrepancy emerges between an individual's intended heading and its actual heading. In this study we develop a theoretical model to explore whether collective navigation benefits are altered according to the form of heading information transmitted between neighbours. Navigation based on each individual's intended heading is found to confer robust advantages across a wide spectrum of flows, via both a marked improvement in migration times and a capacity for a group to overcome flows unnavigable by solitary individuals. Navigation based on individual's actual headings is far less effective, only offering an improvement under highly favourable currents. For many currents, sharing actual heading information leads to journey times that exceed those of individual navigators, negating the suggested benefits proposed by the 'many-wrongs' principle.\nDirect Intake Estimation and Longitudinal Tracking of Solid-food Consumption (DIETS) in Drosophila\nAuthors: Thakare, M. R.; Choudhary, P.; Sunke, S.; Pydah, B.; Yadav, R. S. P.; Agrawal, P.; Das, G.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-06-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.07.543033\nIn Drosophila, an organism much used for dietary studies, comprehending the regulation of feeding and the effect of diet requires accurate measurement of food intake. Although flies are normally housed on agar-based foods, direct estimation of solid feeding has been thought infeasible due to the minute amounts they consume. Moreover, it has been technically challenging to precisely restrict the amount of food flies consume during an experiment. Here, we report a label-free, sensitive, and precise assay, DIETS (Direct Intake Estimation and Tracking of Solid food consumption), that is compatible with videography. In DIETS, food consumed by a group of flies, from a small cup is directly weighed over hours to days. Dietary choice is measured in the assay by weighing food intake from two cups with distinct diets. DIETS enables the quantification of a high-fat diet intake over days. Notably, by limiting food in the cups, we could precisely implement targeted dietary restrictions in flies without diluting nutrients or causing compensatory feeding.\nLevy statistics define anxiety and depression in mice subjected to chronic stress\nAuthors: Li, Q.; Nie, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Xia, M.; Zhao, B.; Tian, C.; Lai, Q.; Luo, Y.; Chen, D.; Zhang, N.; Kuang, W.; He, Y.; Li, X.; Mei, C.; Zhang, T.; Wu, Z.; Zhong, Z.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.18.545232\nAnxiety and depression are considered coping mechanisms organisms adopt in response to external stressors. We employed Levy statistics to investigate the movement patterns of rodent models subjected to stress and compared them to non-stressed controls. Our analysis revealed that stressed mice exhibited heavy-tailed distributions in open fields, consistent with the Levy flights utilized by animal predators in search of scarce food sources. In contrast, non-stressed mice demonstrated a normal distribution of speed. We used the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify significant differences in the {gamma} and parameters derived from Levy flight between anxiety, depression, and control mice. Additionally, we employed the support vector machine algorithm to determine the optimal separation of each group. Furthermore, our mathematical model demonstrated the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. These findings have the potential to contribute to the development of more precise definitions of anxiety and depression, as well as facilitate the evaluation of pharmaceutical developments.\ntakeout gene expression is associated with temporal kin recognition\nAuthors: Potticary, A.; McKinney, E. C.; Moore, P. J.; Moore, A. J.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-06-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.12.544599\nA key component of parental care is avoiding killing and eating your own offspring. Many organisms commit infanticide but switch to parental care at the time when their own offspring would be expected, known as temporal kin recognition. It is unclear how such indirect kin recognition is so common across taxa. One possibility is that temporal kin recognition can be achieved by altering a simple mechanism, such as co-opting the regulation of timing and feeding in other contexts. Here we determine whether takeout, a gene implicated in coordinating feeding, influences temporal kin recognition in the roundneck sexton beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We find that takeout expression is not associated with non-parental feeding changes resulting from hunger, or in the general switch to the full parental care repertoire. However, beetles that accepted and provided care to their offspring had a higher takeout expression than beetles that committed infanticide. Together, these data support the idea that the evolution of temporal kin recognition may be enabled by co-option of mechanisms that integrate feeding behaviour in other contexts.\nThanks to repetition, dustbathing detection can be automated combining accelerometry and wavelet analysis\nAuthors: Fonseca, R. G.; Flesia, A. G.; Spanevello, F.; de la Fuente, M. V.; Bosch, M. C.; Marin, R. H.; Barberis, L.; Kembro, J. M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.546399\nDustbathing is performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes. It consists of a well-defined orderly sequence of movements. Repetitive changes in body position during dustbathing can be automatically detected through data processing of body mounted accelerometer recordings, specifically the complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform. The approach was tested in 13 adult male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) fitted with a backpack containing a triaxial accelerometer and video-recorded during at least 6h. Rhythmicity (period 25-60s) in the y-axis acceleration vector is reflected as large power values, and is associated almost exclusively to dustbathing events. Thus, by implementing a threshold value we detected events automatically with an accuracy of 80% (range 66-100%). We show potential uses for characterizing temporal dynamics (e.g. daily rhythms) of dustbathing and for the assessment of intra- and inter-individual variability over long-term studies, even within large complex environments (e.g. natural environments or breeding facilities).\nPutting a new spin on insect jumping performance using 3D modeling and computer simulations of spotted lanternfly nymphs\nAuthors: Li, C.; Xu, A.; Beery, E. M.; Hsieh, S. T.; Kane, S. A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545794\nHow animals jump and land on a variety of surfaces is an ecologically important problem relevant to bioinspired robotics. We investigated this topic in the context of the jumping biomechanics of the planthopper Lycorma delicatula (the spotted lanternfly, SLF), an invasive insect in the US that jumps frequently for dispersal, locomotion, and predator evasion. High-speed video was used to analyze jumping by SLF nymphs from take-off to impact on compliant surfaces. These insects used rapid hindleg extensions to achieve high take-off speeds (2.7-3.4 m/s) and accelerations (800-1000 ms-2), with midair trajectories consistent with zero-drag ballistic motion without steering. Despite rotating rapidly (5-45 Hz) in the air about time-varying axes of rotation, they landed successfully in 58.9% of trials; they also attained the most successful impact orientation significantly more often than predicted by chance, consistent with their using attitude control. Notably, these insects were able to land successfully when impacting surfaces at all angles, pointing to the emerging importance of collisional recovery behaviors. To further understand their rotational dynamics, we created realistic 3D rendered models of SLFs and used them to compute their mechanical properties during jumping. Computer simulations based on these models and drag torques estimated from fits to tracked data successfully predicted several features of their measured rotational kinematics. This analysis showed that SLF nymphs are able to use posture changes and drag torques to control their angular velocity, and hence their orientation, thereby facilitating predominately successful landings when jumping. SummaryHigh-speed video revealed that juvenile spotted lanternflies are adept at landing after tumbling rapidly midair during jumping. We present computer simulations and realistic 3D models to help explain these abilities.\n",

        <p class="abstract">All living things are profoundly affected by temperature. In spite of the thermodynamic constraints on biology, some animals have evolved to live and move in extremely cold environments. Here, we investigate behavioral mechanisms of cold tolerance in the snow fly (Chionea spp.), a flightless crane fly that is active throughout the winter in boreal and alpine environments of the northern hemisphere. Using thermal imaging, we show that adult snow flies maintain the ability to walk down to an average body temperature of -7 {degrees}C. At this supercooling limit, ice crystallization occurs within the snow flys hemolymph and rapidly spreads throughout the body, resulting in death. However, we discovered that snow flies frequently survive freezing by rapidly amputating legs before ice crystallization can spread to their vital organs. Self-amputation of freezing limbs is a last-ditch tactic to prolong survival in frigid conditions that few animals can endure. Understanding the extreme physiology and behavior of snow insects is urgently important, as the alpine ecosystems they inhabit are being disproportionately altered by anthropogenic climate change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIHow animals use the diel period (24-hour light-dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes.
C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime).
C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available.
C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators.
C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music &#34;to keep them company&#34;; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear. In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages. Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants&#39; descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants&#39; imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is the inhibition of locomotor activity. However, the behavioral effects of endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The phenomenon of collective navigation has received considerable interest in recent years. A common line of thinking, backed by theoretical studies, is that collective navigation can improve navigation efficiency through the &#39;many-wrongs&#39; principle, whereby individual error is reduced by comparing the headings of neighbours. When navigation takes place in a flowing environment, each individual&#39;s trajectory is influenced by drift. Accordingly a potential discrepancy emerges between an individual&#39;s intended heading and its actual heading. In this study we develop a theoretical model to explore whether collective navigation benefits are altered according to the form of heading information transmitted between neighbours. Navigation based on each individual&#39;s intended heading is found to confer robust advantages across a wide spectrum of flows, via both a marked improvement in migration times and a capacity for a group to overcome flows unnavigable by solitary individuals. Navigation based on individual&#39;s actual headings is far less effective, only offering an improvement under highly favourable currents. For many currents, sharing actual heading information leads to journey times that exceed those of individual navigators, negating the suggested benefits proposed by the &#39;many-wrongs&#39; principle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In Drosophila, an organism much used for dietary studies, comprehending the regulation of feeding and the effect of diet requires accurate measurement of food intake. Although flies are normally housed on agar-based foods, direct estimation of solid feeding has been thought infeasible due to the minute amounts they consume. Moreover, it has been technically challenging to precisely restrict the amount of food flies consume during an experiment. Here, we report a label-free, sensitive, and precise assay, DIETS (Direct Intake Estimation and Tracking of Solid food consumption), that is compatible with videography. In DIETS, food consumed by a group of flies, from a small cup is directly weighed over hours to days. Dietary choice is measured in the assay by weighing food intake from two cups with distinct diets. DIETS enables the quantification of a high-fat diet intake over days. Notably, by limiting food in the cups, we could precisely implement targeted dietary restrictions in flies without diluting nutrients or causing compensatory feeding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Anxiety and depression are considered coping mechanisms organisms adopt in response to external stressors. We employed Levy statistics to investigate the movement patterns of rodent models subjected to stress and compared them to non-stressed controls. Our analysis revealed that stressed mice exhibited heavy-tailed distributions in open fields, consistent with the Levy flights utilized by animal predators in search of scarce food sources. In contrast, non-stressed mice demonstrated a normal distribution of speed. We used the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to identify significant differences in the {gamma} and  parameters derived from Levy flight between anxiety, depression, and control mice. Additionally, we employed the support vector machine algorithm to determine the optimal separation of each group. Furthermore, our mathematical model demonstrated the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. These findings have the potential to contribute to the development of more precise definitions of anxiety and depression, as well as facilitate the evaluation of pharmaceutical developments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key component of parental care is avoiding killing and eating your own offspring. Many organisms commit infanticide but switch to parental care at the time when their own offspring would be expected, known as temporal kin recognition. It is unclear how such indirect kin recognition is so common across taxa. One possibility is that temporal kin recognition can be achieved by altering a simple mechanism, such as co-opting the regulation of timing and feeding in other contexts. Here we determine whether takeout, a gene implicated in coordinating feeding, influences temporal kin recognition in the roundneck sexton beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We find that takeout expression is not associated with non-parental feeding changes resulting from hunger, or in the general switch to the full parental care repertoire. However, beetles that accepted and provided care to their offspring had a higher takeout expression than beetles that committed infanticide. Together, these data support the idea that the evolution of temporal kin recognition may be enabled by co-option of mechanisms that integrate feeding behaviour in other contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dustbathing is performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes. It consists of a well-defined orderly sequence of movements. Repetitive changes in body position during dustbathing can be automatically detected through data processing of body mounted accelerometer recordings, specifically the complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform. The approach was tested in 13 adult male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) fitted with a backpack containing a triaxial accelerometer and video-recorded during at least 6h. Rhythmicity (period 25-60s) in the y-axis acceleration vector is reflected as large power values, and is associated almost exclusively to dustbathing events. Thus, by implementing a threshold value we detected events automatically with an accuracy of 80% (range 66-100%). We show potential uses for characterizing temporal dynamics (e.g. daily rhythms) of dustbathing and for the assessment of intra- and inter-individual variability over long-term studies, even within large complex environments (e.g. natural environments or breeding facilities).</p>

        <p class="abstract">How animals jump and land on a variety of surfaces is an ecologically important problem relevant to bioinspired robotics. We investigated this topic in the context of the jumping biomechanics of the planthopper Lycorma delicatula (the spotted lanternfly, SLF), an invasive insect in the US that jumps frequently for dispersal, locomotion, and predator evasion. High-speed video was used to analyze jumping by SLF nymphs from take-off to impact on compliant surfaces. These insects used rapid hindleg extensions to achieve high take-off speeds (2.7-3.4 m/s) and accelerations (800-1000 ms-2), with midair trajectories consistent with zero-drag ballistic motion without steering. Despite rotating rapidly (5-45 Hz) in the air about time-varying axes of rotation, they landed successfully in 58.9% of trials; they also attained the most successful impact orientation significantly more often than predicted by chance, consistent with their using attitude control. Notably, these insects were able to land successfully when impacting surfaces at all angles, pointing to the emerging importance of collisional recovery behaviors. To further understand their rotational dynamics, we created realistic 3D rendered models of SLFs and used them to compute their mechanical properties during jumping. Computer simulations based on these models and drag torques estimated from fits to tracked data successfully predicted several features of their measured rotational kinematics. This analysis showed that SLF nymphs are able to use posture changes and drag torques to control their angular velocity, and hence their orientation, thereby facilitating predominately successful landings when jumping.

SummaryHigh-speed video revealed that juvenile spotted lanternflies are adept at landing after tumbling rapidly midair during jumping. We present computer simulations and realistic 3D models to help explain these abilities.</p>
