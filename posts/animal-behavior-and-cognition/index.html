V.; Stemmer, M.; Baier, H.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560453\nAnimal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade Percomorpha, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived [~]240 million years ago. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika endemic to deep benthic parts of the lake (Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus, Lamprologus ocellatus, and Neolamprologus multifasciatus) or inhabiting rivers (Astatotilapia burtoni) with that of medaka (Oryzias latipes), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae.\nPhysically stressed bees expect less reward in an active choice judgement bias test\nAuthors: Procenko, O.; Read, J.; Nityananda, V.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561175\nEmotion-like states in animals are commonly assessed using judgment bias tests, which measure responses to ambiguous information. A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.\nLearning modifies attention during bumblebee visual search\nAuthors: Robert, T.; Tarapata, K.; Nityananda, V.\nScore: 7.7, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561037\nThe role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher- or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward.\nAcute exposure to caffeine improves navigation in an invasive ant\nAuthors: Galante, H.; De Agro, M.; Koch, A.; Kau, S.; Czaczkes, T. J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561519\nInvasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the reward's location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants' homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ant's ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.\nFARESHARE: An Open-source Apparatus for Assessing Drinking Microstructure in Socially Housed Rats\nAuthors: Frie, J. A.; Khokhar, J. Y.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561248\nSocial factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.\nPositive Transfer of the Whisper Speech Transformer to Human and Animal Voice Activity Detection\nAuthors: Gu, N.; Lee, K.; Basha, M.; Ram, S. K.; You, G.; Hahnloser, R.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560270\nThis paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.1\nDelay of punishment highlights differential vulnerability to developing addiction-like behavior toward sweet food\nAuthors: Solinas, M.; Lardeux, V.; LeBlanc, P.-M.; Longueville, J.-E.; Thiriet, N.; Vandaele, Y.; Panlilio, L. V.; Jaafari, N.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.559890\nResistance to punishment is commonly used as a measure of compulsive behavior in addiction-related processes. We recently developed a progressive shock strength (PSS) procedure in which individual rats can titrate the amount of punishment that they are willing to tolerate to obtain food rewards. Here, we investigated the effects of a range of delays (0-12 sec) on resistance to punishment measured by PSS break points. As expected from delay discounting principles, we found that delayed shock was less effective as a punisher, as revealed by higher PSS breakpoints. However, this discounting effect was not equally distributed in the population of rats, and the introduction of a delay highlighted the existence of two populations: rats that were sensitive to immediate punishment were also weakly sensitive to delay, whereas rats that were resistant to immediate punishment showed strong temporal discounting of delayed punishment. Importantly, shock-sensitive rats suppressed responding even in non-punishment sessions, and they differed from shock-resistant rats in anxiety-like behavior but not in sensitivity to pain. These results show that manipulation of temporal contingencies of punishment in the PSS procedure provides a valuable tool to identify individuals with a double vulnerability to addiction: low sensitivity to aversion and excessive discounting of negative future consequences. Conversely, the shock-sensitive population may provide a model of humans who are vulnerable to opportunity loss due to excessive anxiety.\nThe archerfish can use motor adaptation to correct for light refraction at the water air interface\nAuthors: Volotsky, S.; Donchin, O.; Segev, R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560658\nThe archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the waters surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome light refraction at the air-water interface since there is a considerable difference between the actual location of a target and the line of sight. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate from various angles and positions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of an archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error; i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. The results showed that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbing airflow.\nA locomotion-based assay to measure prepulse inhibition in zebrafish larvae\nAuthors: Read, E.; Hindges, R.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560094\nSensory gating, assessed using a prepulse inhibition assay (PPI), is a promising endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders that can be measured in larval zebrafish models. However, current PPI assays require high-speed cameras to capture rapid c-bend startle behaviours. In this study, we designed and employed a PPI paradigm that uses locomotion as read-out of startle responses. PPI percentage was measured at a maximum of 86% and this was reduced to 42% upon administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. This work provides the foundation for simpler and more accessible PPI assays using larval zebrafish to model key endophenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThe socio-spatial ecology of giant anteaters in the Brazilian Cerrado\nAuthors: Chhen, A.; Noonan, M. J.; Desbiez, A. L.; Bertassoni, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560744\nMovement is a key component of an animals life history. While there are numerous factors that influence movement, there is an inherent link between a species social ecology and its movement ecology. Despite this inherent relationship, the socio-spatial ecology of many species remains unknown, hampering ecological theory and conservation alike. Here, we use fine-scale GPS location data and continuous-time stochastic processes to study the socio-spatial ecology of 23 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that individuals occupied stable home ranges with a mean area of 5.45 km2 with males having significantly larger home ranges than females. The average amount of home-range overlap was low (0.20, n = 121 dyads), with no evidence that giant anteater home ranges were structured based on territorial, mate guarding, nor other social behaviour. We also identified a total of 2774 encounter events. Interestingly, both female-male and male-male dyads had significantly more encounters than female-female dyads, with two pronounced seasonal peaks in female-male encounters. Though encounters occurred frequently, associations between dyads were generally weak and there was little evidence of any correlated movement (mean amount of total correlation = 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest giant anteaters are a solitary and largely asocial species that readily share space with conspecifics. Despite their present capacity to share space, the combined pressures of being condensed into smaller areas and decreased food availability due to increased pesticide use may see behavioural changes radiating throughout the population. Our study provides insight into heretofore unknown aspects of the socio-spatial ecology of this iconic, but understudied species, as well as crucial information for proactive area-based management. Ultimately, these findings contribute towards sustainable development while potentially maintaining the ecological integrity of giant anteaters and their habitats.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Animal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade Percomorpha, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived [~]240 million years ago. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika endemic to deep benthic parts of the lake (Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus, Lamprologus ocellatus, and Neolamprologus multifasciatus) or inhabiting rivers (Astatotilapia burtoni) with that of medaka (Oryzias latipes), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations among hunting teleost larvae.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emotion-like states in animals are commonly assessed using judgment bias tests, which measure responses to ambiguous information. A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher- or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the reward&#39;s location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants&#39; homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ant&#39;s ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.1</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resistance to punishment is commonly used as a measure of compulsive behavior in addiction-related processes. We recently developed a progressive shock strength (PSS) procedure in which individual rats can titrate the amount of punishment that they are willing to tolerate to obtain food rewards. Here, we investigated the effects of a range of delays (0-12 sec) on resistance to punishment measured by PSS break points. As expected from delay discounting principles, we found that delayed shock was less effective as a punisher, as revealed by higher PSS breakpoints. However, this discounting effect was not equally distributed in the population of rats, and the introduction of a delay highlighted the existence of two populations: rats that were sensitive to immediate punishment were also weakly sensitive to delay, whereas rats that were resistant to immediate punishment showed strong temporal discounting of delayed punishment. Importantly, shock-sensitive rats suppressed responding even in non-punishment sessions, and they differed from shock-resistant rats in anxiety-like behavior but not in sensitivity to pain. These results show that manipulation of temporal contingencies of punishment in the PSS procedure provides a valuable tool to identify individuals with a double vulnerability to addiction: low sensitivity to aversion and excessive discounting of negative future consequences. Conversely, the shock-sensitive population may provide a model of humans who are vulnerable to opportunity loss due to excessive anxiety.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the waters surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome light refraction at the air-water interface since there is a considerable difference between the actual location of a target and the line of sight. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate from various angles and positions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of an archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error; i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. The results showed that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbing airflow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sensory gating, assessed using a prepulse inhibition assay (PPI), is a promising endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders that can be measured in larval zebrafish models. However, current PPI assays require high-speed cameras to capture rapid c-bend startle behaviours. In this study, we designed and employed a PPI paradigm that uses locomotion as read-out of startle responses. PPI percentage was measured at a maximum of 86% and this was reduced to 42% upon administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. This work provides the foundation for simpler and more accessible PPI assays using larval zebrafish to model key endophenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Movement is a key component of an animals life history. While there are numerous factors that influence movement, there is an inherent link between a species social ecology and its movement ecology. Despite this inherent relationship, the socio-spatial ecology of many species remains unknown, hampering ecological theory and conservation alike. Here, we use fine-scale GPS location data and continuous-time stochastic processes to study the socio-spatial ecology of 23 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that individuals occupied stable home ranges with a mean area of 5.45 km2 with males having significantly larger home ranges than females. The average amount of home-range overlap was low (0.20, n = 121 dyads), with no evidence that giant anteater home ranges were structured based on territorial, mate guarding, nor other social behaviour. We also identified a total of 2774 encounter events. Interestingly, both female-male and male-male dyads had significantly more encounters than female-female dyads, with two pronounced seasonal peaks in female-male encounters. Though encounters occurred frequently, associations between dyads were generally weak and there was little evidence of any correlated movement (mean amount of total correlation = 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest giant anteaters are a solitary and largely asocial species that readily share space with conspecifics. Despite their present capacity to share space, the combined pressures of being condensed into smaller areas and decreased food availability due to increased pesticide use may see behavioural changes radiating throughout the population. Our study provides insight into heretofore unknown aspects of the socio-spatial ecology of this iconic, but understudied species, as well as crucial information for proactive area-based management. Ultimately, these findings contribute towards sustainable development while potentially maintaining the ecological integrity of giant anteaters and their habitats.</p>
