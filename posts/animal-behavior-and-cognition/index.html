Invertebrate PLB has been restricted to social or object interaction. Here we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that flies exhibit idiosyncratic carousel interactions that qualify as play-like behaviour. While some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others actively seek stimulation, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits to the carousel. We propose that flies voluntarily expose themselves to external forces to intentionally receive exafferent stimulation. Self stimulation provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration. One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek passive movement.

A.; Fristrup, K.; Lolchuragi, D. S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the name's owner. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receiver's vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receiver's calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a call's structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nAn Integrated Platform for in vivo Electrophysiology in Spatial Cognition Experiments\nAuthors: Brea Guerrero, A.; Oijala, M.; Moseley, S. C.; Tang, T.; Fletcher, F.; Zheng, Y.; Sanchez, L. M.; Clark, B.; Mcnaughton, B.; Wilber, A. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551691\nSpatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available. Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform, Maze and Stim Trigger. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. Stim Trigger permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers. Significance StatementThis paper presents an innovative and cost-effective behavioral platform designed to distinguish between different navigational elements, addressing the crucial need for better spatial cognition research paradigms. The platforms flexibility allows for quick modifications without major software or hardware changes. Additionally, the freely available software, comprising Maze and Stim Trigger components, enables precise time stamping of neural events with behavior, while facilitating automatic reward delivery and brain stimulation control. Beyond spatial cognition assessment, the platforms adaptability extends to non-spatial behavioral testing. By openly sharing this software, the authors aim to foster collaboration and encourage future developments, promoting its application to a broader community of researchers. This platform represents a significant advancement in spatial cognition research and behavioral experimentation methods.\nBehavioural, physiological, and genetic drivers of coping\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Guojonsdottir, A. R.; Escriche Chova, P.; Middelburg, E.; Jackels, J.; de Groot, N. G.; Wallner, B.; Massen, J. J. M.; Pfluger, L. S.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555090\nAnimals regularly experience stressful situations, ranging from predation to social stress, yet successfully deal with them on most occasions. This adaptive mechanism, coping, reduces the adverse effects of stressors through behavioural and physiological efforts, failing to which may result in reduced fitness. However, considerable variation in coping is observed. Unlike in humans, coping is often considered a personality trait in non-human animals due to construct similarity, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. Besides, limited multidisciplinary research has rendered comprehending the drivers of coping in animals challenging. We assessed repetitive behavioural coping or coping styles (n=30), emotional arousal (n=12), and consistent inter-individual differences, i.e., personalities (n=32) of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using observations, ecologically relevant experiments, and infrared thermography. We finally investigated the association of coping with a Valine/Methionine polymorphism encoded by the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (n=26), which is widely known for its involvement in human stress regulation. Our findings suggest that personality and the presence of the human equivalent COMT Val158Met polymorphism in long-tailed macaques are associated with emotion-focused and problem-focused coping styles. These coping styles were consistent with emotional arousal as measured with infrared thermography. We discuss these proximate drivers of coping for a better understanding of its evolution in primates.\nSocial complexity affects cognitive abilities but not brain structure in a Poecilid fish\nAuthors: Triki, Z.; Zhou, T.; Argyriou, E.; Sousa de Novais, E.; Servant, O.; Kolm, N.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554009\nComplex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated \"Machiavellian\" strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.\nCognitive limits of larval Drosophila: Testing for conditioned inhibition, sensory preconditioning and second-order conditioning\nAuthors: Sen, E.; El-Keredy, A.; Jacob, N.; Mancini, N.; Asnaz, G.; Widmann, A.; Gerber, B.; Thoener, J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554112\nDrosophila larvae are an established model system for studying the mechanisms of innate and simple forms of learned behaviour. They have about 10 times fewer neurons than adult flies, and it was the low total number of their neurons that allowed for an electron microscopic reconstruction of their brain at synaptic resolution. Regarding the mushroom body, a central brain structure for associative learning in insects, it turned out that more than half of the classes of synaptic connection had previously escaped attention. Understanding the function of these circuit motifs, subsequently confirmed in adult flies, is an important current research topic. In this context, we test larval Drosophila for their cognitive abilities in three tasks that are characteristically more complex than those previously studied. Our data provide evidence for (i) conditioned inhibition, as has previously been reported for adult flies and honeybees. Unlike what is described for adult flies and honeybees, however, our data do not provide evidence for (ii) sensory preconditioning or (iii) second-order conditioning in Drosophila larvae. We discuss methodological features of our experiments as well as four specific aspects of the organisation of the larval brain that may explain why these two forms of learning are observed in honeybees and adult flies, but not in larval Drosophila.\nCase report on lethal dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an anthropogenic landscape\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Pithva, K.; Mohanty, S.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553455\nFor nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.\nHearing loss in juvenile rats leads to excessive play fighting and hyperactivity, mild cognitive deficits and altered neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex\nAuthors: Jelinek, J.; Johne, M.; Alam, M.; Krauss, J. K.; Kral, A.; Schwabe, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554422\nBackgroundIn children, hearing loss has been associated with hyperactivity, disturbed social interaction, and risk of cognitive disturbances. Mechanistic explanations of these relations sometimes involve language. To investigate the effect of hearing loss on behavioral deficits in the absence of language, we tested the impact of hearing loss in juvenile rats on motor, social, and cognitive behavior and on physiology of prefrontal cortex. MethodsHearing loss was induced in juvenile (postnatal day 14) male Sprague-Dawley rats by intracochlear injection of neomycin under general anaesthesia. Sham-operated and non-operated hearing rats served as controls. One week after surgery auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements verified hearing loss or intact hearing in sham-operated and non-operated controls. All rats were then tested for locomotor activity (open field), coordination (Rotarod), and for social interaction during development in weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after surgery. From week 8 on, rats were trained and tested for spatial learning and memory (4-arm baited 8-arm radial maze test). In a final setting, neuronal activity was recorded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). ResultsIn the open field deafened rats moved faster and covered more distance than sham-operated and non-operated controls from week 8 on (both p\u003c0.05). Deafened rats showed significantly more play fighting during development (p\u003c0.05), whereas other aspects of social interaction, such as following, were not affected. Learning of the radial maze test was not impaired in deafened rats (p\u003e0.05), but rats used less next-arm entries than other groups indicating impaired concept learning (p\u003c0.05). In the mPFC neuronal firing rate was reduced and enhanced irregular firing was observed. Moreover, oscillatory activity was altered, both within the mPFC and in coherence of mPFC with the somatosensory cortex (p\u003c0.05). ConclusionsHearing loss in juvenile rats leads to hyperactive behavior and pronounced play-fighting during development, suggesting a causal relationship between hearing loss and cognitive development. Altered neuronal activities in the mPFC after hearing loss support such effects on neuronal networks outside the central auditory system. This animal model provides evidence of developmental consequences of juvenile hearing loss on prefrontal cortex in absence of language as potential confounding factor.\nSocial network structure scales with group size in a multi-species analysis\nAuthors: Gagliardi, B. M.; St-Amant, N.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555173\nSocial networks can shape the evolution and transmission of behaviours. Recent studies have characterized social networks within species, but we know relatively little about the drivers of variation in the structure of social networks across species. Here, we analyze a database of 631 social networks from more than 30 animal species to test how social network properties scale with group size. We examine three properties of social network topology: the uniformity of edge weights within the group, the selectivity of individuals for particular social partners, and the amount of heterogeneity among individuals in social behaviour. We show that most of the variation in these three network properties is due to differences between focal species and/or study methodologies, with only negligible differences between the three animal classes in our analysis (birds, mammals, and insects). Our analysis also indicates that group size is the key factor that determines the topology of animal social networks. In smaller groups, edge weights are distributed more uniformly, and individuals show greater selectivity regarding their social partners. These results suggest that there are general scaling rules governing the social networks of diverse animal species. In small groups, individuals form strong connections to a selective set of partners, whereas in large groups, weaker ties are common, and individuals are less likely to limit their interactions to specific partners.\nAn insect's view of a numerosity illusion: a simple strategy may explain complex numerical performance in bumblebees\nAuthors: Gatto, E.; Guan, C.; Agrillo, C.; Cutini, S.; Chittka, L.; Petrazzini, M. E. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554303\nDespite some similarities in numerical abilities among vertebrates, animals seem to differ with respect to the perceptual factors underlying numerical estimation. This is particularly evident in the case of numerosity illusions, a type of illusory phenomena elicited by the spatial arrangement of the elements that compose it. We investigated whether an insect experiences the most famous numerosity illusion, the Solitaire Illusion. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) presented with two mixed arrays containing magenta and yellow dots were trained to select the array containing the larger number of a target colour (either magenta or yellow). In the test phases, bumblebees were presented with sets of stimuli differing in the numerical ratio, including the illusory arrays: in one array, magenta dots were centrally located (yellow dots in the perimeter), whereas in the other one, magenta dots were located in the perimeter (yellow dots in the centre). Bees discriminated up to a ratio of 0.78 (14 vs. 18). Video analyses showed that bumblebees sequentially scanned the stimuli before making a choice. Bumblebees required longer scanning time for patterns with smaller numbers of reinforced colour dots, suggesting that bumblebees spent longer time on searching for more information or finding a reinforced arrangement of spatial dots before making an accurate decision. In the presence of the \"illusion arrangement\", bees behaved in a manner consistent with misperception of numerosity, overestimating the number of centrally located dots. The spatial configuration of the stimuli influenced how the patterns were assessed: bees examined the clustered reinforced colour dots longer. Flying paths analysis suggested that bumblebees followed the paths formed by similar colour dots rather than counting each dot to make a numerical discrimination. These results challenge the notion that visual illusions can be inferred simply from evaluating choices of different visual patterns and reinforce the idea that multiple strategies can potentially be used to achieve seemingly similar cognitive outcomes. Detailed analyses of decision-making processes are essential to deduce the cognitive strategies underpinning discrimination tasks, whether they are numerical or other visual tasks.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been restricted to social or object interaction. Here we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that flies exhibit idiosyncratic carousel interactions that qualify as play-like behaviour. While some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others actively seek stimulation, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits to the carousel. We propose that flies voluntarily expose themselves to external forces to intentionally receive exafferent stimulation. Self stimulation provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek passive movement.

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the name&#39;s owner. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receiver&#39;s vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receiver&#39;s calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a call&#39;s structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available.

Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform,  Maze and  Stim Trigger. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones.  Stim Trigger permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers.

Significance StatementThis paper presents an innovative and cost-effective behavioral platform designed to distinguish between different navigational elements, addressing the crucial need for better spatial cognition research paradigms. The platforms flexibility allows for quick modifications without major software or hardware changes. Additionally, the freely available software, comprising  Maze and  Stim Trigger components, enables precise time stamping of neural events with behavior, while facilitating automatic reward delivery and brain stimulation control. Beyond spatial cognition assessment, the platforms adaptability extends to non-spatial behavioral testing. By openly sharing this software, the authors aim to foster collaboration and encourage future developments, promoting its application to a broader community of researchers. This platform represents a significant advancement in spatial cognition research and behavioral experimentation methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals regularly experience stressful situations, ranging from predation to social stress, yet successfully deal with them on most occasions. This adaptive mechanism, coping, reduces the adverse effects of stressors through behavioural and physiological efforts, failing to which may result in reduced fitness. However, considerable variation in coping is observed. Unlike in humans, coping is often considered a personality trait in non-human animals due to construct similarity, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. Besides, limited multidisciplinary research has rendered comprehending the drivers of coping in animals challenging. We assessed repetitive behavioural coping or coping styles (n=30), emotional arousal (n=12), and consistent inter-individual differences, i.e., personalities (n=32) of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using observations, ecologically relevant experiments, and infrared thermography. We finally investigated the association of coping with a Valine/Methionine polymorphism encoded by the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (n=26), which is widely known for its involvement in human stress regulation. Our findings suggest that personality and the presence of the human equivalent COMT Val158Met polymorphism in long-tailed macaques are associated with emotion-focused and problem-focused coping styles. These coping styles were consistent with emotional arousal as measured with infrared thermography. We discuss these proximate drivers of coping for a better understanding of its evolution in primates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Complex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated &#34;Machiavellian&#34; strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Drosophila larvae are an established model system for studying the mechanisms of innate and simple forms of learned behaviour. They have about 10 times fewer neurons than adult flies, and it was the low total number of their neurons that allowed for an electron microscopic reconstruction of their brain at synaptic resolution. Regarding the mushroom body, a central brain structure for associative learning in insects, it turned out that more than half of the classes of synaptic connection had previously escaped attention. Understanding the function of these circuit motifs, subsequently confirmed in adult flies, is an important current research topic. In this context, we test larval Drosophila for their cognitive abilities in three tasks that are characteristically more complex than those previously studied. Our data provide evidence for (i) conditioned inhibition, as has previously been reported for adult flies and honeybees. Unlike what is described for adult flies and honeybees, however, our data do not provide evidence for (ii) sensory preconditioning or (iii) second-order conditioning in Drosophila larvae. We discuss methodological features of our experiments as well as four specific aspects of the organisation of the larval brain that may explain why these two forms of learning are observed in honeybees and adult flies, but not in larval Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn children, hearing loss has been associated with hyperactivity, disturbed social interaction, and risk of cognitive disturbances. Mechanistic explanations of these relations sometimes involve language. To investigate the effect of hearing loss on behavioral deficits in the absence of language, we tested the impact of hearing loss in juvenile rats on motor, social, and cognitive behavior and on physiology of prefrontal cortex.

MethodsHearing loss was induced in juvenile (postnatal day 14) male Sprague-Dawley rats by intracochlear injection of neomycin under general anaesthesia. Sham-operated and non-operated hearing rats served as controls. One week after surgery auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements verified hearing loss or intact hearing in sham-operated and non-operated controls. All rats were then tested for locomotor activity (open field), coordination (Rotarod), and for social interaction during development in weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after surgery. From week 8 on, rats were trained and tested for spatial learning and memory (4-arm baited 8-arm radial maze test). In a final setting, neuronal activity was recorded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

ResultsIn the open field deafened rats moved faster and covered more distance than sham-operated and non-operated controls from week 8 on (both p&lt;0.05). Deafened rats showed significantly more play fighting during development (p&lt;0.05), whereas other aspects of social interaction, such as following, were not affected. Learning of the radial maze test was not impaired in deafened rats (p&gt;0.05), but rats used less next-arm entries than other groups indicating impaired concept learning (p&lt;0.05). In the mPFC neuronal firing rate was reduced and enhanced irregular firing was observed. Moreover, oscillatory activity was altered, both within the mPFC and in coherence of mPFC with the somatosensory cortex (p&lt;0.05).

ConclusionsHearing loss in juvenile rats leads to hyperactive behavior and pronounced play-fighting during development, suggesting a causal relationship between hearing loss and cognitive development. Altered neuronal activities in the mPFC after hearing loss support such effects on neuronal networks outside the central auditory system. This animal model provides evidence of developmental consequences of juvenile hearing loss on prefrontal cortex in absence of language as potential confounding factor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social networks can shape the evolution and transmission of behaviours. Recent studies have characterized social networks within species, but we know relatively little about the drivers of variation in the structure of social networks across species. Here, we analyze a database of 631 social networks from more than 30 animal species to test how social network properties scale with group size. We examine three properties of social network topology: the uniformity of edge weights within the group, the selectivity of individuals for particular social partners, and the amount of heterogeneity among individuals in social behaviour. We show that most of the variation in these three network properties is due to differences between focal species and/or study methodologies, with only negligible differences between the three animal classes in our analysis (birds, mammals, and insects). Our analysis also indicates that group size is the key factor that determines the topology of animal social networks. In smaller groups, edge weights are distributed more uniformly, and individuals show greater selectivity regarding their social partners. These results suggest that there are general scaling rules governing the social networks of diverse animal species. In small groups, individuals form strong connections to a selective set of partners, whereas in large groups, weaker ties are common, and individuals are less likely to limit their interactions to specific partners.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite some similarities in numerical abilities among vertebrates, animals seem to differ with respect to the perceptual factors underlying numerical estimation. This is particularly evident in the case of numerosity illusions, a type of illusory phenomena elicited by the spatial arrangement of the elements that compose it. We investigated whether an insect experiences the most famous numerosity illusion, the Solitaire Illusion. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) presented with two mixed arrays containing magenta and yellow dots were trained to select the array containing the larger number of a target colour (either magenta or yellow). In the test phases, bumblebees were presented with sets of stimuli differing in the numerical ratio, including the illusory arrays: in one array, magenta dots were centrally located (yellow dots in the perimeter), whereas in the other one, magenta dots were located in the perimeter (yellow dots in the centre). Bees discriminated up to a ratio of 0.78 (14 vs. 18). Video analyses showed that bumblebees sequentially scanned the stimuli before making a choice. Bumblebees required longer scanning time for patterns with smaller numbers of reinforced colour dots, suggesting that bumblebees spent longer time on searching for more information or finding a reinforced arrangement of spatial dots before making an accurate decision. In the presence of the &#34;illusion arrangement&#34;, bees behaved in a manner consistent with misperception of numerosity, overestimating the number of centrally located dots. The spatial configuration of the stimuli influenced how the patterns were assessed: bees examined the clustered reinforced colour dots longer. Flying paths analysis suggested that bumblebees followed the paths formed by similar colour dots rather than counting each dot to make a numerical discrimination. These results challenge the notion that visual illusions can be inferred simply from evaluating choices of different visual patterns and reinforce the idea that multiple strategies can potentially be used to achieve seemingly similar cognitive outcomes. Detailed analyses of decision-making processes are essential to deduce the cognitive strategies underpinning discrimination tasks, whether they are numerical or other visual tasks.</p>
