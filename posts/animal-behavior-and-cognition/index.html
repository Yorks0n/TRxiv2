H.; Tung, J.\nScore: 263.0, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569325\nDominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.\nWhole group tracking reveals that relatedness drives consistent subgrouping patterns in white-nosed coatis\nAuthors: Grout, E. M.; Ortega, J.; Minasandra, P.; Quin, M. J.; Crofoot, M. C.; Strandburg-Peshkin, A.; Hirsch, B. T.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571650\nThe formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.\nRats rely on airflow cues for self-motion perception\nAuthors: Polat, L.; Harpaz, T.; Zaidel, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572298\nSelf-motion perception is a vital skill for all species. It is an inherently multisensory process, that combines inertial (body-based) and relative (with respect to the environment) motion cues. While extensively studied in human and non-human primates, there is currently no paradigm to test self-motion perception in rodents using both inertial and relative self-motion cues. We developed a novel rodent motion simulator using two synchronized robotic arms to generate inertial, relative or combined (inertial and relative) cues of self-motion. Eight rats were trained to perform a task of heading-discrimination, similar to the popular primate paradigm. Strikingly, the rats relied heavily on airflow for relative self-motion perception, with little contribution from optic flow (performance in the dark was almost as good). Relative self-motion (airflow) was perceived with greater reliability vs. inertial. Disrupting airflow (using a fan or windshield) damaged relative, but not inertial, self-motion perception. However, whiskers were not needed for this function. Lastly, the rats integrated relative and inertial self-motion cues in a reliability-based (Bayesian-like) manner. These results implicate airflow as a dominant cue for self-motion perception in rats, and provide a new domain to investigate the neural bases of self-motion perception and multisensory processing in awake behaving rodents.\nDoes novelty influence foraging decision of a scavenger?\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Sau, S.; Das, J.; Bhadra, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571372\nAcquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.\nDo electromagnetic fields from subsea power cables effect elasmobranch behaviour? A risk-based approach for the Dutch Continental Shelf\nAuthors: Hermans, A.; Winter, H. V.; Gill, A. B.; Murk, A. J.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569531\nSubsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 {micro}T) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.\nARBUR: a Machine Learning-based Analysis System for Relating Behaviors and Ultrasonic Vocalizations of Rats\nAuthors: Jia, G.; Chen, Z.; Zhou, Q.; Zhang, Y.; Quan, Z.; Chen, X.; Fukuda, T.; Huang, Q.; Shi, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572288\nDeciphering how different types of behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of rats interact can yield insights into the neural basis of social interaction. However, the behavior-vocalization interplay of rats remains elusive because of the challenges of relating the two communication media in complex social contexts. Here, we propose a machine learning-based analysis system called ARBUR. ARBUR can cluster without bias both non-step (continuous) and step USVs via three steps, hierarchically detect eight types of behavior of two freely behaving rats with high accuracy, and locate the vocal rat in 3-D space. By simultaneously recording the video and ultrasonic streams of two freely behaving rats, we show that ARBUR can not only automatically reveal the well-understood behavior-associated vocalizations that were carefully concluded by other behavioral researchers, but also hold the promise to indicate novel findings that can be hardly found by manual analysis, especially regarding step USVs and the active/passive rat-associated vocalizations during aggressive/intimate social behaviors. Using ARBUR, we further confirm that rats communicate via distinct USVs when engaging in different types of social behavior. This work could help mechanistically understand the interactive influence between the behavior and USVs of rats.\nChemotactile perception and associative learning of amino acids in yellowjacket workers\nAuthors: Mattiacci, A.; Pietrantuono, A. L.; Corley, J. C.; Masciocchi, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.572014\nLearning and memory are essential for animal survival, influencing preferences, decision-making, and foraging behaviour. In this study, we explore the perceptual and learning abilities of Vespula germanica (yellowjacket wasps) to various amino acids. We hypothesize that V. germanica can qualitatively evaluate various amino acid solutions, given their scavenging habits and the possibility of metabolizing amino acids to fuel energy. Through chemo-tactile differential conditioning, we studied worker wasp' maxilla labium extension response (MaLER) to essential (Lysine, Tryptophan, Arginine) and non-essential amino acids (Ornithine, Aspartic acid, Glycine). Conditioning sessions included individual amino acids against water and comparisons between different amino acids. Additionally, we tested retention, discrimination, and generalization abilities, 30 minutes later with conditioned and novel stimuli. Our results show that wasps exhibit the ability to learn and discriminate various amino acids. The discrimination capacity extended to differentiating between pairs of amino acids. Memory retention was generally robust, but certain associations observed during conditioning did not persist after a 30-minute interval. Moreover, when wasps were trained with essential amino acids, the acquired learning did not generally extend to other non-essential amino acids, except for Arginine, which exhibited generalization when tested with its precursor, Ornithine. Conversely, when trained with non-essential amino acids, the acquired learning generalized to other essential amino acids. These results suggest that, unlike other hymenopterans, wasps can detect, discriminate, and generalize free amino acids, crucial for their foraging decisions. This knowledge contributes to understanding the cognitive dimensions of V. germanica and their implications for targeted pest management.\nAgonism between family groups of cooperative breeding smooth-coated otters (Lutrogale perspicillata)\nAuthors: Fan, Z.; Ang, D.; Tan, M.-M.; Johns, P.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572272\nIntraspecific agonistic interactions are common in the animal kingdom and have significant consequences for animals. With a growing population and limited resources, these interactions have been observed more frequently among smooth-coated otters in Singapore. However, little is known about the behavioral patterns of these interactions and the factors that may affect their outcomes. To address this, we analyzed intraspecific agonistic interactions through publicly available videos from citizen scientists. Our analysis revealed different behavioral patterns and typical behaviors between winning and losing family groups in different environments. We also found suggestive evidence that larger family groups with more individuals than opponents have an advantage in these interactions. The environment in which an interaction occurs may also affect its intensity.\nHummingbirds rapidly respond to the removal of vision and control a sequence of rate-commanded maneuvers in milliseconds\nAuthors: Anwar, M. Z.; Tobalske, B. W.; Agrawal, S.; Mongeau, J.-M.; Luo, H.; Cheng, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571331\nHummingbird flight is the epitome of extreme aerial agility and controlled stability, as hummingbirds routinely exercise a variety of stunning aerobatic feats. Yet, the control of these amazing maneuvers is not well understood. Here we examined how hummingbirds control a sequence of maneuvers within milliseconds and tested whether and when their vision is active during this rapid process. We elicited escape flight in calliope hummingbirds and removed visible light at various instants during the maneuvers and quantified their flight kinematics and responses. We show that the escape maneuvers were composed of rapidly-controlled sequential modules, including evasion, reorientation, nose-down dive, forward flight, and nose-up to hover. The hummingbirds did not respond to the light removal during evasion and reorientation until a critical light-removal time; afterward they showed two categories of luminance-based responses that rapidly altered maneuvering modules to terminate the escape. We also show that hummingbird maneuvers are rate-commanded and require no active braking, i.e., their body angular velocities were proportional to the change of wing motion patterns, a trait that likely alleviates the computational demand on flight control. Together, this work uncovers the key traits of hummingbird agility, which can also inform and inspire designs for next-generation agile aerial systems.\nJava sparrow song conforms to Menzerath's Law but not Zipf's Law of Abbreviation\nAuthors: Lewis, R. N.; Kwong, A.; Soma, M.; de Kort, S. R.; Gilman, R. T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571437\nLinguistic laws, which describe common statistical patterns in human language, are often studied in animal communication systems. Despite good evidence for the existence of these laws in non-human primates, data is still limited for other taxa. Birdsong is often used as a model for human language development due to similarities in vocal learning and production. Therefore, it is useful to explore features of human language in birdsong to determine the value and limitations of such comparisons. Here, we looked for patterns consistent with Menzeraths law, the tendency for longer sequences to be made up of smaller constituent parts, and Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, the tendency for more frequently used elements to be shorter in length, in the songs of Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora). We found that songs conformed to Menzeraths law at both the population and individual level; longer sequences were made up of shorter notes, and this pattern was achieved through note selection, rather than shortening existing notes. This adherence to Menzeraths law may reflect species-specific constraints on song durations. However, we found no evidence to support adherence to Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, either at population or individual level; more frequently used notes were not shorter in length. As they are used in courtship, songs may experience different selection pressure to other parts of the vocal repertoire, which could act against compression. Whilst there may be some limitations in applying linguistic laws designed for human language to birdsong, especially Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, these laws may still provide insights into animal and human communication systems.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-motion perception is a vital skill for all species. It is an inherently multisensory process, that combines inertial (body-based) and relative (with respect to the environment) motion cues. While extensively studied in human and non-human primates, there is currently no paradigm to test self-motion perception in rodents using both inertial and relative self-motion cues. We developed a novel rodent motion simulator using two synchronized robotic arms to generate inertial, relative or combined (inertial and relative) cues of self-motion. Eight rats were trained to perform a task of heading-discrimination, similar to the popular primate paradigm. Strikingly, the rats relied heavily on airflow for relative self-motion perception, with little contribution from optic flow (performance in the dark was almost as good). Relative self-motion (airflow) was perceived with greater reliability vs. inertial. Disrupting airflow (using a fan or windshield) damaged relative, but not inertial, self-motion perception. However, whiskers were not needed for this function. Lastly, the rats integrated relative and inertial self-motion cues in a reliability-based (Bayesian-like) manner. These results implicate airflow as a dominant cue for self-motion perception in rats, and provide a new domain to investigate the neural bases of self-motion perception and multisensory processing in awake behaving rodents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Subsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 {micro}T) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deciphering how different types of behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of rats interact can yield insights into the neural basis of social interaction. However, the behavior-vocalization interplay of rats remains elusive because of the challenges of relating the two communication media in complex social contexts. Here, we propose a machine learning-based analysis system called ARBUR. ARBUR can cluster without bias both non-step (continuous) and step USVs via three steps, hierarchically detect eight types of behavior of two freely behaving rats with high accuracy, and locate the vocal rat in 3-D space. By simultaneously recording the video and ultrasonic streams of two freely behaving rats, we show that ARBUR can not only automatically reveal the well-understood behavior-associated vocalizations that were carefully concluded by other behavioral researchers, but also hold the promise to indicate novel findings that can be hardly found by manual analysis, especially regarding step USVs and the active/passive rat-associated vocalizations during aggressive/intimate social behaviors. Using ARBUR, we further confirm that rats communicate via distinct USVs when engaging in different types of social behavior. This work could help mechanistically understand the interactive influence between the behavior and USVs of rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning and memory are essential for animal survival, influencing preferences, decision-making, and foraging behaviour. In this study, we explore the perceptual and learning abilities of Vespula germanica (yellowjacket wasps) to various amino acids. We hypothesize that V. germanica can qualitatively evaluate various amino acid solutions, given their scavenging habits and the possibility of metabolizing amino acids to fuel energy. Through chemo-tactile differential conditioning, we studied worker wasp&#39; maxilla labium extension response (MaLER) to essential (Lysine, Tryptophan, Arginine) and non-essential amino acids (Ornithine, Aspartic acid, Glycine). Conditioning sessions included individual amino acids against water and comparisons between different amino acids. Additionally, we tested retention, discrimination, and generalization abilities, 30 minutes later with conditioned and novel stimuli. Our results show that wasps exhibit the ability to learn and discriminate various amino acids. The discrimination capacity extended to differentiating between pairs of amino acids. Memory retention was generally robust, but certain associations observed during conditioning did not persist after a 30-minute interval. Moreover, when wasps were trained with essential amino acids, the acquired learning did not generally extend to other non-essential amino acids, except for Arginine, which exhibited generalization when tested with its precursor, Ornithine. Conversely, when trained with non-essential amino acids, the acquired learning generalized to other essential amino acids. These results suggest that, unlike other hymenopterans, wasps can detect, discriminate, and generalize free amino acids, crucial for their foraging decisions. This knowledge contributes to understanding the cognitive dimensions of V. germanica and their implications for targeted pest management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intraspecific agonistic interactions are common in the animal kingdom and have significant consequences for animals. With a growing population and limited resources, these interactions have been observed more frequently among smooth-coated otters in Singapore. However, little is known about the behavioral patterns of these interactions and the factors that may affect their outcomes. To address this, we analyzed intraspecific agonistic interactions through publicly available videos from citizen scientists. Our analysis revealed different behavioral patterns and typical behaviors between winning and losing family groups in different environments. We also found suggestive evidence that larger family groups with more individuals than opponents have an advantage in these interactions. The environment in which an interaction occurs may also affect its intensity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hummingbird flight is the epitome of extreme aerial agility and controlled stability, as hummingbirds routinely exercise a variety of stunning aerobatic feats. Yet, the control of these amazing maneuvers is not well understood. Here we examined how hummingbirds control a sequence of maneuvers within milliseconds and tested whether and when their vision is active during this rapid process. We elicited escape flight in calliope hummingbirds and removed visible light at various instants during the maneuvers and quantified their flight kinematics and responses. We show that the escape maneuvers were composed of rapidly-controlled sequential modules, including evasion, reorientation, nose-down dive, forward flight, and nose-up to hover. The hummingbirds did not respond to the light removal during evasion and reorientation until a critical light-removal time; afterward they showed two categories of luminance-based responses that rapidly altered maneuvering modules to terminate the escape. We also show that hummingbird maneuvers are rate-commanded and require no active braking, i.e., their body angular velocities were proportional to the change of wing motion patterns, a trait that likely alleviates the computational demand on flight control. Together, this work uncovers the key traits of hummingbird agility, which can also inform and inspire designs for next-generation agile aerial systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Linguistic laws, which describe common statistical patterns in human language, are often studied in animal communication systems. Despite good evidence for the existence of these laws in non-human primates, data is still limited for other taxa. Birdsong is often used as a model for human language development due to similarities in vocal learning and production. Therefore, it is useful to explore features of human language in birdsong to determine the value and limitations of such comparisons. Here, we looked for patterns consistent with Menzeraths law, the tendency for longer sequences to be made up of smaller constituent parts, and Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, the tendency for more frequently used elements to be shorter in length, in the songs of Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora). We found that songs conformed to Menzeraths law at both the population and individual level; longer sequences were made up of shorter notes, and this pattern was achieved through note selection, rather than shortening existing notes. This adherence to Menzeraths law may reflect species-specific constraints on song durations. However, we found no evidence to support adherence to Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, either at population or individual level; more frequently used notes were not shorter in length. As they are used in courtship, songs may experience different selection pressure to other parts of the vocal repertoire, which could act against compression. Whilst there may be some limitations in applying linguistic laws designed for human language to birdsong, especially Zipfs Law of Abbreviation, these laws may still provide insights into animal and human communication systems.</p>
