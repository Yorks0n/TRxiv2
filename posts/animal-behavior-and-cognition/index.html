Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

S.; Costantini, I.; Baracchi, D.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552092\nScientific research exploring the impact of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial systems is still at an early stage but has already confirmed that exposure to plastics leads to various detrimental health effects in several organisms. Although recent studies have shown the toxicological effects of single MP polymers on honey bees, the effects of different polymer combinations and their consequences on cognitive and behavioural performance remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of MPs, both individually and in combination, on the cognitive abilities of the honey bee Apis mellifera. We evaluated the acute oral toxicity of Polystyrene (PS) and Plexiglass (PMMA) MPs, as well as a combination of the two (MIX), at three different concentrations (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L-1) and analysed their effects on sucrose responsiveness and appetitive olfactory learning and memory. We also explored whether these MPs could reach and accumulate in the insect brain using Two-Photon Fluorescence Microscopy (TPFM) in combination with an optimized version of the DISCO clearing technique. The results revealed that PS reduced the responsiveness of foragers to sucrose, whereas PMMA had no significant impact; however, the combination of PMMA and PS had a pronounced negative effect on sucrose responsiveness. In addition, both PMMA and PS, as well as MIX, impaired bee learning formation and memory retrieval, with PS exhibiting the most severe effects. Regarding our brain imaging analysis performed with TFPM, we found that after only three days of oral exposure, MPs could penetrate and accumulate in the brain. These results raise concerns about the potential mechanical, cellular, and biochemical damage that MPs may cause to the central nervous system.\nIndividuals lack the capacity to accurately detect emotional piloerection\nAuthors: McPhetres, J.; Han, A.; Gao, H. H.; Kemp, N.; Khati, B.; Pu, C. X.; Smith, A.; Shui, X.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549671\nPiloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being \"emotionally moved\" and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance. Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.\nSocial attention across development in common ravens and carrion crows\nAuthors: Miller (Harrison), R.; Boeckle, M.; Ridgway, S.; Richardson, J.; Uhl, F.; Bugnyar, T.; Schwab, C.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551806\nUnderlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head \u0026 body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone, C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of head \u0026 body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of other's presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.\nA Framework for Fast, Large-scale, Semi-Automatic Inference of Animal Behavior from Monocular Videos\nAuthors: Price, E.; Khandelwal, P. C.; Rubenstein, D. I.; Ahmad, A.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551177\nAn automatic, quick, accurate, and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our methods workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grevys Zebras (Equus quagga and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior using our method.

S.; Messender, D.; Ferreira, S. T.; Lourenco, M. V.; Pandolfo, P.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551984\nAbnormal cognitive and sensorial properties have been reported in patients with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic signaling and plasticity in brain areas related to cognitive and sensory processing. The spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR), in comparison to the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), is the most used genetic animal model to study ADHD. Brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical for midbrain and hippocampal dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation, is reduced in both ADHD subjects and SHR. Physical exercise (e.g. swimming) promotes neuroplasticity and improves cognition by increasing BDNF and irisin. Here we investigate the effects of gestational swimming on sensorial and behavioral phenotypes, striatal dopaminergic parameters, and hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and BDNF levels observed in WKY and SHR. Gestational swimming improved nociceptive reflex impairment in SHR rats and increased hippocampal BDNF levels in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent offspring. Sex differences were observed in hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels, with females presenting lower levels than males. Our results contribute to the notion that swimming during pregnancy is a promising alternative to improve ADHD phenotypes in the offspring.

M.; McMillan, W. O.; Pardo-Diaz, C.; Salazar, C.; Merrill, R. M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552099\nTraits under divergent ecological selection that also function during mating can be important in maintaining species boundaries. Few studies have considered mutual mate choice, where both males and females base mating decisions on the same trait. We investigated the contribution of visual preference to assortative mating between an aposematic butterfly Heliconius cydno and its sympatric relative H. melpomene. Wing colouration in Heliconius butterflies evolved as a warning signal but also functions as a mating cue. We predicted that both sexes of H. cydno contributed to assortative mating by exhibiting visual preference towards conspecific wing colouration. We analysed published and new data from preference experiments, in which males were presented with conspecific and H. melpomene females. We also recorded female responses and mating outcomes in choice experiments, involving conspecific males with either the original white or artificially painted red forewing bands. Both sexes of H. cydno responded more positively towards the conspecific colouration, yet male colouration did not predict mating outcomes in female choice experiments. As courtships are initiated by males in butterflies, our findings suggest that female visual preference might be of secondary importance in preventing gene flow between H. cydno and H. melpomene.\nSocial influences on delayed gratification in New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays\nAuthors: Miller, R.; Davies, J.; Schiestl, M.; Garcia-Pelegrin, E.; Gray, R. D.; Taylor, A. H.; Clayton, N. S.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549039\nSelf-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.\nMice remember experiences via conspecific-context: models of social episodic-like memory\nAuthors: Ross, T. W.; Poulter, S. L.; Lever, C.; Easton, A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552022\nThe ability to remember unique past events (episodic memory) may be an evolutionarily conserved function, with accumulating evidence of episodic-(like) memory processing in rodents. In humans, it likely contributes to successful complex social networking. Rodents, arguably the most used laboratory models, are also rather social animals. However, many behavioural paradigms are devoid of sociality, and commonly-used social spontaneous recognition tasks (SRTs) are open to non-episodic strategies based upon familiarity. We address this gap by developing new SRT variants. Here, in object-in-context SRTs, we asked if context could be specified by the presence/absence of either a conspecific (experiment 1) or an additional local object (experiment 2). We show that mice readily used the conspecific as contextual information to distinguish unique episodes in memory. In contrast, no coherent behavioural response emerged when an additional object was used as a potential context specifier. Further, in a new social conspecific-in-context SRT (experiment 3) where environment-based change was the context specifier, mice preferably explored a more recently-seen familiar conspecific associated with contextual mismatch, over a less recently-seen familiar conspecific presented in the same context. The results argue that, in incidental SRT conditions, mice readily incorporate conspecific cue information into episodic-like memory. Thus, the tasks offer different ways to assess and further understand the mechanisms at work in social episodic-like memory processing.\nDifferences Between Human and Non-Human Primate Theory of Mind: Evidence from Computational Modeling\nAuthors: Berke, M.; Horschler, D.; Jara-Ettinger, J.; Santos, L.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551487\nCan non-human primates (NHPs) represent other minds? Answering this question has been historically difficult because primates can fail experimental tasks due to a lack of motivation, or succeed through simpler mechanisms. Here we introduce a computational approach for comparative cognition that enables us to quantitatively test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We formalized a collection of theories of NHP social cognition with varying representational complexity and compared them against data from classical NHP studies, focusing on the ability to determine what others know based on what they see. Our results uncovered that, while the most human-like models of NHP social cognition make perfect qualitative predictions, they predict effect sizes that are too strong to be plausible. Instead, theories of intermediate representational complexity best explained the data. At the same time, we show that it is possible for human-like models to capture non-human primate behavior (NHP), as long as we assume that NHPs rely on these representations only about one third of the time. These results show that, in visual perspective taking tasks, NHPs likely draw upon simpler social representations than humans, either in terms of representational complexity, or in terms of use.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek self-stimulation on a carousel.

        <p class="abstract">Scientific research exploring the impact of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial systems is still at an early stage but has already confirmed that exposure to plastics leads to various detrimental health effects in several organisms. Although recent studies have shown the toxicological effects of single MP polymers on honey bees, the effects of different polymer combinations and their consequences on cognitive and behavioural performance remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of MPs, both individually and in combination, on the cognitive abilities of the honey bee Apis mellifera. We evaluated the acute oral toxicity of Polystyrene (PS) and Plexiglass (PMMA) MPs, as well as a combination of the two (MIX), at three different concentrations (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L-1) and analysed their effects on sucrose responsiveness and appetitive olfactory learning and memory. We also explored whether these MPs could reach and accumulate in the insect brain using Two-Photon Fluorescence Microscopy (TPFM) in combination with an optimized version of the DISCO clearing technique. The results revealed that PS reduced the responsiveness of foragers to sucrose, whereas PMMA had no significant impact; however, the combination of PMMA and PS had a pronounced negative effect on sucrose responsiveness. In addition, both PMMA and PS, as well as MIX, impaired bee learning formation and memory retrieval, with PS exhibiting the most severe effects. Regarding our brain imaging analysis performed with TFPM, we found that after only three days of oral exposure, MPs could penetrate and accumulate in the brain. These results raise concerns about the potential mechanical, cellular, and biochemical damage that MPs may cause to the central nervous system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being &#34;emotionally moved&#34; and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.

Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Underlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head &amp; body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone, C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of head &amp; body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of other&#39;s presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An automatic, quick, accurate, and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our methods workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grevys Zebras (Equus quagga and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior using our method.

        <p class="abstract">Abnormal cognitive and sensorial properties have been reported in patients with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic signaling and plasticity in brain areas related to cognitive and sensory processing. The spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR), in comparison to the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), is the most used genetic animal model to study ADHD. Brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical for midbrain and hippocampal dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation, is reduced in both ADHD subjects and SHR. Physical exercise (e.g. swimming) promotes neuroplasticity and improves cognition by increasing BDNF and irisin. Here we investigate the effects of gestational swimming on sensorial and behavioral phenotypes, striatal dopaminergic parameters, and hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and BDNF levels observed in WKY and SHR. Gestational swimming improved nociceptive reflex impairment in SHR rats and increased hippocampal BDNF levels in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent offspring. Sex differences were observed in hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels, with females presenting lower levels than males. Our results contribute to the notion that swimming during pregnancy is a promising alternative to improve ADHD phenotypes in the offspring.

        <p class="abstract">Traits under divergent ecological selection that also function during mating can be important in maintaining species boundaries. Few studies have considered mutual mate choice, where both males and females base mating decisions on the same trait. We investigated the contribution of visual preference to assortative mating between an aposematic butterfly Heliconius cydno and its sympatric relative H. melpomene. Wing colouration in Heliconius butterflies evolved as a warning signal but also functions as a mating cue. We predicted that both sexes of H. cydno contributed to assortative mating by exhibiting visual preference towards conspecific wing colouration. We analysed published and new data from preference experiments, in which males were presented with conspecific and H. melpomene females. We also recorded female responses and mating outcomes in choice experiments, involving conspecific males with either the original white or artificially painted red forewing bands. Both sexes of H. cydno responded more positively towards the conspecific colouration, yet male colouration did not predict mating outcomes in female choice experiments. As courtships are initiated by males in butterflies, our findings suggest that female visual preference might be of secondary importance in preventing gene flow between H. cydno and H. melpomene.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the  rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to remember unique past events (episodic memory) may be an evolutionarily conserved function, with accumulating evidence of episodic-(like) memory processing in rodents. In humans, it likely contributes to successful complex social networking. Rodents, arguably the most used laboratory models, are also rather social animals. However, many behavioural paradigms are devoid of sociality, and commonly-used social spontaneous recognition tasks (SRTs) are open to non-episodic strategies based upon familiarity. We address this gap by developing new SRT variants. Here, in object-in-context SRTs, we asked if context could be specified by the presence/absence of either a conspecific (experiment 1) or an additional local object (experiment 2). We show that mice readily used the conspecific as contextual information to distinguish unique episodes in memory. In contrast, no coherent behavioural response emerged when an additional object was used as a potential context specifier. Further, in a new social conspecific-in-context SRT (experiment 3) where environment-based change was the context specifier, mice preferably explored a more recently-seen familiar conspecific associated with contextual mismatch, over a less recently-seen familiar conspecific presented in the same context. The results argue that, in incidental SRT conditions, mice readily incorporate conspecific cue information into episodic-like memory. Thus, the tasks offer different ways to assess and further understand the mechanisms at work in social episodic-like memory processing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Can non-human primates (NHPs) represent other minds? Answering this question has been historically difficult because primates can fail experimental tasks due to a lack of motivation, or succeed through simpler mechanisms. Here we introduce a computational approach for comparative cognition that enables us to quantitatively test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We formalized a collection of theories of NHP social cognition with varying representational complexity and compared them against data from classical NHP studies, focusing on the ability to determine what others know based on what they see. Our results uncovered that, while the most human-like models of NHP social cognition make perfect qualitative predictions, they predict effect sizes that are too strong to be plausible. Instead, theories of intermediate representational complexity best explained the data. At the same time, we show that it is possible for human-like models to capture non-human primate behavior (NHP), as long as we assume that NHPs rely on these representations only about one third of the time. These results show that, in visual perspective taking tasks, NHPs likely draw upon simpler social representations than humans, either in terms of representational complexity, or in terms of use.</p>
