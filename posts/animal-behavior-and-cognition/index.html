E.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562087\nDo animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an \"internal world\" to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (\u003e85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work. Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

Q.; Gillis, Z. S.; Rich, E. L.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563329\nIn value-based decisions, there are frequently multiple attributes, such as cost, quality, or quantity, that contribute to the overall goodness of an option. Since one option may not be better in all attributes at once, the decision process should include a means of weighing relevant attributes. Most decision-making models solve this problem by computing an integrated value, or utility, for each option from a weighted combination of attributes. However, behavioral anomalies in decision-making, such as context effects, indicate that other attribute-specific computations might be taking place. Here, we tested whether rhesus macaques show evidence of attribute-specific processing in a value-based decision-making task. Monkeys made a series of decisions involving choice options comprising a sweetness and probability attribute. Each attribute was represented by a separate bar with one of two mappings between bar size and the magnitude of the attribute (i.e., bigger=better or bigger=worse). We found that translating across different mappings produced selective impairments in decision-making. When like attributes differed, monkeys were prevented from easily making direct attribute comparisons, and choices were less accurate and preferences were more variable. This was not the case when mappings of unalike attributes within the same option were different. Likewise, gaze patterns favored transitions between like attributes over transitions between unalike attributes of the same option, so that like attributes were sampled sequentially to support within-attribute comparisons. Together, these data demonstrate that value-based decisions rely, at least in part, on directly comparing like attributes of multi-attribute options.\nInformation gathering explains decision dynamics during human and monkey reward foraging\nAuthors: Barack, D. L.; Parodi, F.; Ludwig, V.; Platt, M. L.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562362\nForaging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest--lingering too long in depleting patches--is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.\nDNA metabarcoding reveals limited consumption of livestock and black rhinoceros by spotted hyenas in a prey-rich environment\nAuthors: Dheer, A.; Danabalan, R.; Pellizzone, A.; Davidian, E.; Naman, P.; Mazzoni, C.; Honer, O. P.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563067\nThe diet of large carnivores is of great interest to conservation managers, as it can reveal the extent of human-carnivore conflict and the impact of carnivores on species of high conservation priority. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA can identify species and is often more reliable in doing so than observational or morphological methods. Metabarcoding is particularly powerful at detecting elusive and rare species and has therefore become a widely applied tool in biodiversity research. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to determine the diet of spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro Crater, a protected area in Northern Tanzania surrounded by areas co-inhabited by pastoralists. We assessed which species hyenas preferably consumed over a 24-year period and how frequently they consumed pastoralist livestock and black rhinoceros, a species of high economic value and conservation priority. We further estimated the effects of three key socio-demographic variables - age, social rank, and sex - on the propensity of hyenas to consume livestock. We detected DNA from 20 species in 371 hyena feces. Hyenas preferably consumed blue wildebeest and Grant's gazelle. Among the detected species were five domestic species and one wild species that lived in the pastoralist-inhabited areas but not the Crater. This shows that resident Crater hyenas undertake foraging trips to areas surrounding the Crater. DNA of domestic species however was rarely detected (4.1% of 434 detections), and predominantly in feces of old hyenas. This suggests that Crater hyenas rarely consume livestock and that livestock is mostly consumed by hyenas less capable of hunting fleet-footed and powerful wild prey. No DNA of black rhinoceros was detected in any of the samples, suggesting that Crater hyenas do not frequently consume rhinoceros. Our findings suggest that the impact of Crater hyenas on livestock and wildlife of high conservation priority is limited. Our study highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding to assess the extent of human-carnivore conflict and to guide evidence-based conservation efforts to promote coexistence of carnivores, humans and species of high conservation priority.\nCritical reproductive behaviors in Scaled Quail and Northern Bobwhite are affected by thermal variability and mean temperature\nAuthors: Kirkpatrick, W.; Sauer, E.; Carroll, R.; Cohen, J.; DuRant, S.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563339\nEnvironmental conditions can influence parental care behaviors, which in turn can greatly affect the microhabitat conditions experienced by developing offspring. It is critical to uncover relationships between ambient weather, parental behaviors, and offspring thermal environments to understand the ability of organisms to mitigate environmental conditions and predict outcomes under climate change. In warm conditions, avian parents may spend longer periods away from the nest, but we know little of how increased thermal variation drives these changes or what temporal scale influences the changes. We examined how parents mediate environmental conditions for developing offspring in two quail species, Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginiatus), by examining changes in the duration and timing of incubation off-bouts (recesses away from the nest) in relation to mean temperature and temperature variability experienced over either a 24-hour period (low resolution) or in the two hours immediately preceding an off-bout (high resolution). We found species-specific differences in off-bout duration, with Scaled Quail spending a significantly shorter time off the nest daily. In both species, we detected a positive relationship between average thermal conditions and the start time of afternoon off-bouts. Alternatively, morning off-bouts occur earlier in response to increased thermal variation from the previous day. Warm conditions immediately preceding off-bouts led to increased off-bout duration with the opposite trend in response to increased variation. Our findings suggest that the thermal environment, in contrasting ways over varying thermal and temporal scales, can have a significant impact on parental care behaviors. These alterations can lead to altered thermal environments for offspring across multiple scales. Therefore, determining how the thermal environment induces behavioral changes requires high-resolution environmental data.\nExcess neonatal testosterone causes male-specific social and fear memory deficits in wild-type mice\nAuthors: Quinones-Labernik, P.; Blocklinger, K. L.; Bruce, M. R.; Ferri, S. L.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562939\nNeurodevelopmental disorders (ND) disproportionately affect males compared to females, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in particular exhibits a 4:1 male bias. The biological mechanisms of this female protection or male susceptibility have not been identified. There is some evidence to suggest that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play pivotal roles in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the role of testosterone administration during a critical period of development, and its effects on social approach and fear learning in C57BL/6J wildtype mice. Male, but not female mice treated with testosterone on the day of birth (PN0) exhibited deficits in both social behavior and contextual fear conditioning, whereas mice treated with the same dose of testosterone on postnatal day 18 (PN18) did not display such impairments. Testosterone administration did not induce anxiogenic effects or lead to changes in weight compared to the testosterone-treated group. These impairments are relevant to ND and may help identify novel treatment targets. HighlightsO_LIMale mice treated with testosterone at birth displayed reduced social approach behavior as juveniles and demonstrated impairments in contextual fear conditioning as adults, compared to mice treated with vehicle oil. C_LIO_LITestosterone treatment on postnatal day 18 did not affect social approach or fear memory.

C.; Fish, E. W.; Dooley, J. C.; Carroll, M. C.; Parnell, S. E.; Besheer, J.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561571\nPrenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol + CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.\nMetamorphosis reverses the risk-taking behavioral phenotype in moor frog along a latitudinal gradient\nAuthors: Cortazar-Chinarro, M.; Corral-Lopez, A.; Ludtke, D.; Luquet, E.; Laurila, A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562178\nUnderstanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.\nBehavioral and genetic correlates of heterogeneity in learning performance in individual honeybees, Apis mellifera\nAuthors: Menzel, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563551\nLearning an olfactory discrimination task leads to heterogeneous results in honeybees with bees performing very well and others at low rates. Here we investigated this behavioral heterogeneity and asked whether it is associated with particular gene expression patterns. Bees were individually conditioned in a sequential conditioning protocol involving several phases of olfactory learning and retention tests. The rate of CS+ odor learning was found to correlate highest with a cumulative performance score extracted from all learning and retention tests. The cumulative score was used to sort the tested bees into high and low performers. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the mushroom body area of the brains of these bees disclosed a list of genes, which were differentially expressed between the high and low performers. These candidate genes are implicated in diverse biological functions, such as neurotransmission, memory formation, cargo trafficking and development.\nA Markovian dynamics for C. elegans behavior across scales\nAuthors: Costa, A. C.; Ahamed, T.; Jordan, D.; Stephens, G. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563098\nHow do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm C. elegans, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both \"runs-and-pirouettes\" as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Do animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an &#34;internal world&#34; to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (&gt;85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work.

Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

        <p class="abstract">In value-based decisions, there are frequently multiple attributes, such as cost, quality, or quantity, that contribute to the overall goodness of an option. Since one option may not be better in all attributes at once, the decision process should include a means of weighing relevant attributes. Most decision-making models solve this problem by computing an integrated value, or utility, for each option from a weighted combination of attributes. However, behavioral anomalies in decision-making, such as context effects, indicate that other attribute-specific computations might be taking place. Here, we tested whether rhesus macaques show evidence of attribute-specific processing in a value-based decision-making task. Monkeys made a series of decisions involving choice options comprising a sweetness and probability attribute. Each attribute was represented by a separate bar with one of two mappings between bar size and the magnitude of the attribute (i.e., bigger=better or bigger=worse). We found that translating across different mappings produced selective impairments in decision-making. When like attributes differed, monkeys were prevented from easily making direct attribute comparisons, and choices were less accurate and preferences were more variable. This was not the case when mappings of unalike attributes within the same option were different. Likewise, gaze patterns favored transitions between like attributes over transitions between unalike attributes of the same option, so that like attributes were sampled sequentially to support within-attribute comparisons. Together, these data demonstrate that value-based decisions rely, at least in part, on directly comparing like attributes of multi-attribute options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Foraging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest--lingering too long in depleting patches--is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The diet of large carnivores is of great interest to conservation managers, as it can reveal the extent of human-carnivore conflict and the impact of carnivores on species of high conservation priority. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA can identify species and is often more reliable in doing so than observational or morphological methods. Metabarcoding is particularly powerful at detecting elusive and rare species and has therefore become a widely applied tool in biodiversity research. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to determine the diet of spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro Crater, a protected area in Northern Tanzania surrounded by areas co-inhabited by pastoralists. We assessed which species hyenas preferably consumed over a 24-year period and how frequently they consumed pastoralist livestock and black rhinoceros, a species of high economic value and conservation priority. We further estimated the effects of three key socio-demographic variables - age, social rank, and sex - on the propensity of hyenas to consume livestock. We detected DNA from 20 species in 371 hyena feces. Hyenas preferably consumed blue wildebeest and Grant&#39;s gazelle. Among the detected species were five domestic species and one wild species that lived in the pastoralist-inhabited areas but not the Crater. This shows that resident Crater hyenas undertake foraging trips to areas surrounding the Crater. DNA of domestic species however was rarely detected (4.1% of 434 detections), and predominantly in feces of old hyenas. This suggests that Crater hyenas rarely consume livestock and that livestock is mostly consumed by hyenas less capable of hunting fleet-footed and powerful wild prey. No DNA of black rhinoceros was detected in any of the samples, suggesting that Crater hyenas do not frequently consume rhinoceros. Our findings suggest that the impact of Crater hyenas on livestock and wildlife of high conservation priority is limited. Our study highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding to assess the extent of human-carnivore conflict and to guide evidence-based conservation efforts to promote coexistence of carnivores, humans and species of high conservation priority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Environmental conditions can influence parental care behaviors, which in turn can greatly affect the microhabitat conditions experienced by developing offspring. It is critical to uncover relationships between ambient weather, parental behaviors, and offspring thermal environments to understand the ability of organisms to mitigate environmental conditions and predict outcomes under climate change. In warm conditions, avian parents may spend longer periods away from the nest, but we know little of how increased thermal variation drives these changes or what temporal scale influences the changes. We examined how parents mediate environmental conditions for developing offspring in two quail species, Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginiatus), by examining changes in the duration and timing of incubation off-bouts (recesses away from the nest) in relation to mean temperature and temperature variability experienced over either a 24-hour period (low resolution) or in the two hours immediately preceding an off-bout (high resolution). We found species-specific differences in off-bout duration, with Scaled Quail spending a significantly shorter time off the nest daily. In both species, we detected a positive relationship between average thermal conditions and the start time of afternoon off-bouts. Alternatively, morning off-bouts occur earlier in response to increased thermal variation from the previous day. Warm conditions immediately preceding off-bouts led to increased off-bout duration with the opposite trend in response to increased variation. Our findings suggest that the thermal environment, in contrasting ways over varying thermal and temporal scales, can have a significant impact on parental care behaviors. These alterations can lead to altered thermal environments for offspring across multiple scales. Therefore, determining how the thermal environment induces behavioral changes requires high-resolution environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) disproportionately affect males compared to females, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in particular exhibits a 4:1 male bias. The biological mechanisms of this female protection or male susceptibility have not been identified. There is some evidence to suggest that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play pivotal roles in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the role of testosterone administration during a critical period of development, and its effects on social approach and fear learning in C57BL/6J wildtype mice. Male, but not female mice treated with testosterone on the day of birth (PN0) exhibited deficits in both social behavior and contextual fear conditioning, whereas mice treated with the same dose of testosterone on postnatal day 18 (PN18) did not display such impairments. Testosterone administration did not induce anxiogenic effects or lead to changes in weight compared to the testosterone-treated group. These impairments are relevant to ND and may help identify novel treatment targets.

HighlightsO_LIMale mice treated with testosterone at birth displayed reduced social approach behavior as juveniles and demonstrated impairments in contextual fear conditioning as adults, compared to mice treated with vehicle oil.
C_LIO_LITestosterone treatment on postnatal day 18 did not affect social approach or fear memory.

        <p class="abstract">Prenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol &#43; CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning an olfactory discrimination task leads to heterogeneous results in honeybees with bees performing very well and others at low rates. Here we investigated this behavioral heterogeneity and asked whether it is associated with particular gene expression patterns. Bees were individually conditioned in a sequential conditioning protocol involving several phases of olfactory learning and retention tests. The rate of CS&#43; odor learning was found to correlate highest with a cumulative performance score extracted from all learning and retention tests. The cumulative score was used to sort the tested bees into high and low performers. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the mushroom body area of the brains of these bees disclosed a list of genes, which were differentially expressed between the high and low performers. These candidate genes are implicated in diverse biological functions, such as neurotransmission, memory formation, cargo trafficking and development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm C. elegans, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm&#39;s foraging behavior, revealing both &#34;runs-and-pirouettes&#34; as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies.</p>
