H.; Tung, J.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569325\nDominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.\nIndividual recognition in a jumping spider (Phidippus regius)\nAuthors: Dahl, C. D.; Cheng, Y.\nScore: 47.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567545\nIndividual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.\nDevelopmental arcs of plasticity in whole movement repertoires of a clonal fish\nAuthors: Ehlman, S. M.; Scherer, U.; Bierbach, D.; Stärk, L.; Beese, M.; Wolf, M.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570540\nDevelopmental plasticity at the behavioral repertoire level allows animals to incrementally adjust their behavioral phenotypes to match their environments through ontogeny, serving as a lynchpin between ecological factors that cue phenotypic adjustments and evolutionary forces that select upon emergent phenotypic variation. Quantifying the continuous arcs of plasticity throughout animals development, however, has often been prohibitively challenging. Here, we leverage recent advancements in high-resolution behavioral tracking and analysis to (i) track the behavior of 45 genetically identical fish clones (Poecilia formosa) reared in near-identical environments during their first four weeks of life at 0.2 s resolution and (ii) quantify the continuous arcs of plasticity across entire behavioral repertoires through development. Doing so, we are able to test one of the most fundamental theoretical predictions from Bayesian models of development that in stable (but initially unknown) environments, behavioral plasticity should gradually decrease from a maximum at the beginning of life. Using two approaches to measure plasticity across ontogeny, we first quantify plasticity in individual behavioral metrics before also developing a novel whole-repertoire approach that calculates plasticity as the degree of behavioral entropy across a multi-dimensional behavioral phenotype space. We robustly find - despite experimentally matching as best as possible the assumptions of models that predict decreasing plasticity - a [~]two-week initial increase in plasticity in movement behaviors before plasticity subsequently decreased. Our results challenge a common intuition about the optimal developmental course of plasticity through early ontogeny, thereby also demonstrating the value of long-term behavioral tracking approaches for testing fundamental predictions on phenotypic development. Significance statementBehavioral plasticity across development may help animals adjust to uncertainty in moderately unpredictable environments. In stable environments, developing animals should gradually decrease this uncertainty through ontogeny, becoming less sensitive to incoming information (and thus less behaviorally plastic) as they age. This intuitive expectation of old dog inflexibility to new tricks, however, has not been adequately tested with the long-term, highresolution datasets that would be ideal. Here, we achieve such a test and emphasize the significance of this study in (1) providing a novel method for quantifying multi-dimensional behavioral plasticity continuously across long-term, high-resolution behavioral timeseries and in (2) testing fundamental theory that links the temporal patterning of environmental conditions to evolved patterns of behavioral plasticity across development.\nSubcallosal area 25: its responsivity to the stress hormone cortisol and its opposing effects on appetitive motivation in marmosets\nAuthors: Banai Tizkar, R.; McIver, L.; Wood, C. M.; Roberts, A. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.571112\nAberrant activity in caudal subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex (scACC) is implicated in depression and anxiety symptomatology, with its normalisation a putative biomarker of successful treatment response. The function of scACC in emotion processing and mental health is not fully understood despite its known influence on stress-mediated processes through its rich expression of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. Here we examine the causal interaction between area 25 within scACC (scACC-25) and the stress hormone, cortisol, in the context of anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, the overall role of scACC-25 in hedonic capacity and motivation is investigated under transient pharmacological inactivation and overactivation. The results suggest that a local increase of cortisol in scACC-25 shows a rapid induction of anticipatory anhedonia and increased responsiveness to uncertain threat. Separate inactivation and overactivation of scACC-25 increased and decreased motivation and hedonic capacity, respectively, likely through different underlying mechanisms. Together, these data show that area scACC-25 has a causal role in consummatory and motivational behaviour and produces rapid responses to the stress hormone cortisol, that mediates anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviour.\nContextual and Combinatorial Structure in Sperm Whale Vocalisations\nAuthors: Sharma, P.; Gero, S.; Payne, R.; Gruber, D.; Rus, D.; Torralba, A.; Andreas, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570484\nSperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are long-lived and highly social mammals that engage in complex group behaviours, including navigation, foraging, and child-rearing. During these behaviours, sperm whales communicate primarily using sequences of short bursts of clicks with varying inter-click intervals, known as codas. Past research has identified around 150 discrete coda types globally, with 21 in the Caribbean. A subset of these have been shown to encode information about caller and clan identity. However, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown. In this study, we show that codas exhibit contextual and combinatorial structure with key similarities to aspects of human language and other primate communication systems. First, we report previously undescribed variations in coda structure that are sensitive to the conversational context in which they occur. We call these rubato and ornamentation, by analogy to musical terminology. These variations are systematically controlled and imitated across individual whales. Second, we show that coda types are not defined by arbitrary sequences of inter-click intervals, but instead form a combinatorial coding system in which rubato and ornamentation combine with two categorical, context-independent features that we call rhythm and tempo to give rise to a large inventory of distinguishable codas. In a dataset of 8,719 codas from the sperm whales of the Eastern Caribbean clan, this sperm whale phonetic alphabet makes it possible to systematically explain observed variability in coda structure. Sperm whale vocalisations are more expressive and structured than previously believed, and are built from a repertoire comprising nearly an order of magnitude more distinguishable codas. These results show contextsensitive and combinatorial vocalisation systems extend beyond humans, and can appear in an organism with a divergent evolutionary lineage and vocal apparatus.\nNon-instructed Motor Skill Learning in Monkeys: Insights from Deep Reinforcement Learning Models\nAuthors: Carminatti, L.; Condro, L.; Riehle, A.; Grün, S.; Brochier, T.; Dauce, E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569889\nIn the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: \"Time\" reflecting the time spent to perfom a trial, and \"Power\" integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of \"path selection\", that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (\"Time\") and minimizing its metabolic cost (\"Power\"), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play. Author summaryThe way in which animals and humans learn new motor skills through free exploratory movements sequences solely governed by success or failure outcomes is not yet fully understood. Recent advances in machine learning techniques for continuous action spaces led us to construct a motor learning model investigate how animals progressively enhance the efficiency of their behaviors through numerous trials and errors. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison between deep learning models and experimental data from monkey behavior. Notably, we show that the progressive refinement of motor sequences, as they are observed in the animals, do not require the implementation of a complete model of their environment. Rather, it merely requires the capacity to anticipate both movement costs and final reward a few steps ahead in the future following a value iteration principle. Furthermore, the systematic deviations exhibited by the monkeys with respect to the computational model inform us on the presence of individual preferences in either minimizing the duration or the energy consumption, and also on the involvement of alternative \"cognitive\" strategies.\nDoes Zipf's law of abbreviation shape birdsong?\nAuthors: Gilman, R. T.; Durrant, C.; Malpas, L.; Lewis, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.569773\nZipfs law of abbreviation predicts that in human languages, words that are used more frequently will be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This has been attributed to the principle of least effort - communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipfs law of abbreviation appears to hold for all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds for animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are less frequently used. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this analysis. We used ZLAvian to study Zipfs law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found weak trends consistent with Zipfs law of abbreviation in 10 of the 11 populations. Across all populations, the negative correlation between phrase length and frequency of use was several times weaker than the negative correlation between word length and frequency of use in human languages. This suggests that the mechanisms that underlie this correlation may be different in birdsong and human language.\nWind Gates Search States in Free Flight\nAuthors: Stupski, S. D.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569086\nFor any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise \"virtual\" olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped \"sink and circle\" search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and \"anemometric\" turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the  interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developmental plasticity at the behavioral repertoire level allows animals to incrementally adjust their behavioral phenotypes to match their environments through ontogeny, serving as a lynchpin between ecological factors that cue phenotypic adjustments and evolutionary forces that select upon emergent phenotypic variation. Quantifying the continuous arcs of plasticity throughout animals development, however, has often been prohibitively challenging. Here, we leverage recent advancements in high-resolution behavioral tracking and analysis to (i) track the behavior of 45 genetically identical fish clones (Poecilia formosa) reared in near-identical environments during their first four weeks of life at 0.2 s resolution and (ii) quantify the continuous arcs of plasticity across entire behavioral repertoires through development. Doing so, we are able to test one of the most fundamental theoretical predictions from Bayesian models of development that in stable (but initially unknown) environments, behavioral plasticity should gradually decrease from a maximum at the beginning of life. Using two approaches to measure plasticity across ontogeny, we first quantify plasticity in individual behavioral metrics before also developing a novel whole-repertoire approach that calculates plasticity as the degree of  behavioral entropy across a multi-dimensional behavioral phenotype space. We robustly find - despite experimentally matching as best as possible the assumptions of models that predict decreasing plasticity - a [~]two-week initial increase in plasticity in movement behaviors before plasticity subsequently decreased. Our results challenge a common intuition about the optimal developmental course of plasticity through early ontogeny, thereby also demonstrating the value of long-term behavioral tracking approaches for testing fundamental predictions on phenotypic development.

Significance statementBehavioral plasticity across development may help animals adjust to uncertainty in moderately unpredictable environments. In stable environments, developing animals should gradually decrease this uncertainty through ontogeny, becoming less sensitive to incoming information (and thus less behaviorally plastic) as they age. This intuitive expectation of  old dog inflexibility to  new tricks, however, has not been adequately tested with the long-term, highresolution datasets that would be ideal. Here, we achieve such a test and emphasize the significance of this study in (1) providing a novel method for quantifying multi-dimensional behavioral plasticity continuously across long-term, high-resolution behavioral timeseries and in (2) testing fundamental theory that links the temporal patterning of environmental conditions to evolved patterns of behavioral plasticity across development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrant activity in caudal subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex (scACC) is implicated in depression and anxiety symptomatology, with its normalisation a putative biomarker of successful treatment response. The function of scACC in emotion processing and mental health is not fully understood despite its known influence on stress-mediated processes through its rich expression of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. Here we examine the causal interaction between area 25 within scACC (scACC-25) and the stress hormone, cortisol, in the context of anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, the overall role of scACC-25 in hedonic capacity and motivation is investigated under transient pharmacological inactivation and overactivation. The results suggest that a local increase of cortisol in scACC-25 shows a rapid induction of anticipatory anhedonia and increased responsiveness to uncertain threat. Separate inactivation and overactivation of scACC-25 increased and decreased motivation and hedonic capacity, respectively, likely through different underlying mechanisms. Together, these data show that area scACC-25 has a causal role in consummatory and motivational behaviour and produces rapid responses to the stress hormone cortisol, that mediates anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are long-lived and highly social mammals that engage in complex group behaviours, including navigation, foraging, and child-rearing. During these behaviours, sperm whales communicate primarily using sequences of short bursts of clicks with varying inter-click intervals, known as codas. Past research has identified around 150 discrete coda types globally, with 21 in the Caribbean. A subset of these have been shown to encode information about caller and clan identity. However, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown. In this study, we show that codas exhibit contextual and combinatorial structure with key similarities to aspects of human language and other primate communication systems. First, we report previously undescribed variations in coda structure that are sensitive to the conversational context in which they occur. We call these rubato and ornamentation, by analogy to musical terminology. These variations are systematically controlled and imitated across individual whales. Second, we show that coda types are not defined by arbitrary sequences of inter-click intervals, but instead form a combinatorial coding system in which rubato and ornamentation combine with two categorical, context-independent features that we call rhythm and tempo to give rise to a large inventory of distinguishable codas. In a dataset of 8,719 codas from the sperm whales of the Eastern Caribbean clan, this  sperm whale phonetic alphabet makes it possible to systematically explain observed variability in coda structure. Sperm whale vocalisations are more expressive and structured than previously believed, and are built from a repertoire comprising nearly an order of magnitude more distinguishable codas. These results show contextsensitive and combinatorial vocalisation systems extend beyond humans, and can appear in an organism with a divergent evolutionary lineage and vocal apparatus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: &#34;Time&#34; reflecting the time spent to perfom a trial, and &#34;Power&#34; integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of &#34;path selection&#34;, that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (&#34;Time&#34;) and minimizing its metabolic cost (&#34;Power&#34;), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play.

Author summaryThe way in which animals and humans learn new motor skills through free exploratory movements sequences solely governed by success or failure outcomes is not yet fully understood. Recent advances in machine learning techniques for continuous action spaces led us to construct a motor learning model investigate how animals progressively enhance the efficiency of their behaviors through numerous trials and errors. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison between deep learning models and experimental data from monkey behavior. Notably, we show that the progressive refinement of motor sequences, as they are observed in the animals, do not require the implementation of a complete model of their environment. Rather, it merely requires the capacity to anticipate both movement costs and final reward a few steps ahead in the future following a value iteration principle. Furthermore, the systematic deviations exhibited by the monkeys with respect to the computational model inform us on the presence of individual preferences in either minimizing the duration or the energy consumption, and also on the involvement of alternative &#34;cognitive&#34; strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zipfs law of abbreviation predicts that in human languages, words that are used more frequently will be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This has been attributed to the principle of least effort - communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipfs law of abbreviation appears to hold for all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds for animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are less frequently used. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this analysis. We used ZLAvian to study Zipfs law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found weak trends consistent with Zipfs law of abbreviation in 10 of the 11 populations. Across all populations, the negative correlation between phrase length and frequency of use was several times weaker than the negative correlation between word length and frequency of use in human languages. This suggests that the mechanisms that underlie this correlation may be different in birdsong and human language.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise &#34;virtual&#34; olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped &#34;sink and circle&#34; search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and &#34;anemometric&#34; turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.</p>
