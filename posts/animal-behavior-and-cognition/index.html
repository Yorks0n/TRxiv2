In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nTap Dancing Frogs: Posterior Toe Tapping and Feeding Behavior in Dendrobates tinctorius\nAuthors: Parrish, T. Q.; Fischer, E. K.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558032\nAnimals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics. Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.\nHuman-like dissociations between confidence and accuracy in convolutional neural networks\nAuthors: Shekhar, M.; Rahnev, D.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578187\nPrior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from low-level changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet -50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of the CNNs internal representations leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for adjudicating between low-level, stimulus-driven and high-level, cognitive explanations of human behavior.\nInhibition of V1a-like receptors disrupts male-male affiliative relationships formed by triadic cohabitation inlarge-billed crows\nAuthors: Seguchi, A.; Izawa, E.-I.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578519\nAffiliative relationships, such as parent-offspring bonds, male-female pair-bonds, and within-sex coalitions/alliances, are beneficial for group-living animals to increase fitness and reproductive success. Male-male affiliative relationship, such as coalitions/alliances, have been reported in social mammals and birds in situations where three or more individuals interact, suggesting that male-male affiliative relationships can be formed via interactive situations involving three (or more) individuals. However, no experimental studies have tested this hypothesis on social animals. Many studies on mammals and birds have revealed that an affiliative relationship is underpinned by the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin (VP) system. However, the role of the OT/VP system has been studied only in parent-offspring bonds and pair-bonds and is lacking in male-male affiliative relationships. In this study, we found the 2-week cohabitation of three male crows in an aviary facilitated affiliative relationship formation between two of the three crows (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of peripheral administration of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist peripheral administration on the social behaviour of affiliated males. We found that the V1aR antagonist caused the disappearance of affiliative behaviour and the resurgence of agonistic behaviour in affiliated males. Our findings provide the first evidence for V1aR involvement in male-male affiliative relationships in vertebrates.\nEvidence for interacting but decoupled controls of decisions and movements in non-human primates\nAuthors: Saleri, C.; Thura, D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577721\nMany recent studies indicate that control of decisions and actions is integrated during interactive behavior. Among these, several carried out in humans and monkeys conclude that there is a co-regulation of choices and movements. Another perspective, based on human data only, proposes a decoupled control of decision duration and movement speed, allowing for instance to trade decision duration for movement duration when time pressure increases. Crucially, it is not currently known whether this ability to flexibly dissociate decision duration from movement speed is specific to humans, whether it can vary depending on the context in which a task is performed, and whether it is stable over time. These are important questions to address, especially to rely on monkey electrophysiology to infer the neural mechanisms of decision-action coordination in humans. To do so, we trained two macaque monkeys in a perceptual decision-making task and analyzed data collected over multiple behavioral sessions. Our findings reveal a strong and complex relationship between decision duration and movement vigor. Decision duration and action duration can co-vary but also \"compensate\" each other. Such integrated but decoupled control of decisions and actions aligns with recent studies in humans, validating the monkey model in electrophysiology as a means of inferring neural mechanisms in humans. Crucially, we demonstrate for the first time that this control can evolve with experience, in an adapted manner. Together, the present findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the integrated control of decisions and actions during interactive behavior. New \u0026 noteworthyThe mechanism by which the integrated control of decisions and actions occurs, coupled or interactive but decoupled, is debated. In the present study, we show in monkeys that decisions and actions influence each other in a decoupled way. For the first time, we also demonstrate that this control can evolve depending the subjects experience, allowing to trade movement time for decision time and limit the temporal discounting of reward value.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nBold zebrafish (danio rerio) learn faster in an associative learning task\nAuthors: Corcoran, J.; Storks, L.; Wong, R. Y.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578005\nAnimals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.\nProjections from thalamic nucleus reuniens to hippocampal CA1 area enable context value updating\nAuthors: Ziołkowska, M.; Sotoudeh, N.; Cały, A.; Puchalska, M.; Pagano, R.; Sliwinska, M. A.; Salamian, A.; Radwanska, K.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578155\nThe ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-\u0026gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.\nCharacterisation of behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in the aged male rat\nAuthors: Jackson, M. G.; Lightman, S. L.; Robinson, E. S. J.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578556\nApathy is a complex psychiatric syndrome characterised by motivational deficit, emotional blunting and cognitive changes. It occurs alongside a broad range of neurological disorders, but also occurs in otherwise healthy ageing. Despite its clinical prevalence, apathy does not yet have a designated treatment strategy. Generation of a translational animal model of apathy syndrome would facilitate the development of novel treatments. Given the multidimensional nature of apathy, a model cannot be achieved with a single behavioural test. Using a battery of behavioural tests we investigated whether aged rats exhibit behavioural deficits across different domains relevant to apathy. Using the effort for reward and progressive ratio tasks we found that aged rats (21-27 months) show intact reward motivation. Using the novelty supressed feeding test and position-based object exploration we found aged rats showed increased anxiety-like behaviour inconsistent with emotional blunting. The sucrose preference test and reward learning assay showed intact reward sensitivity and reward-related cognition in aged rats. However, using a bowl-digging version of the probabilistic reversal learning task, we found a deficit in cognitive flexibility in aged rats that did not translate across to a touchscreen version of the task. While these data reveal important changes in cognitive flexibility and anxiety associated with ageing, aged rats do not show deficits across other behavioural domains relevant to apathy. This suggests that aged rats are not a suitable model for age-related apathy syndrome. These findings contrast with previous work in mice, revealing important species differences in behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in ageing.\nRisking your Tail: Modeling Individual Differences in Risk-sensitive Exploration using Conditional Value at Risk and Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Processes\nAuthors: Shen, T.; Dayan, P.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574574\nNovelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus coloured by risk-sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals' differing prior expectations about reward and threat and degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk-sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behaviour of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena (Akiti et al. Neuron 110, 2022). We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (stereotyped tail-behind) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. We find that \"brave\" animals, though varied in their behavior, generally are more risk neutral, and enjoy a flexible hazard prior. They begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward. On the other hand, \"timid\" animals, characterized by risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors, display self-censoring that leads to the sort of asymptotic maladaptive behavior that is often associated with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities in humans and other animals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics.

Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from low-level changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet -50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of the CNNs internal representations leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for adjudicating between low-level, stimulus-driven and high-level, cognitive explanations of human behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Affiliative relationships, such as parent-offspring bonds, male-female pair-bonds, and within-sex coalitions/alliances, are beneficial for group-living animals to increase fitness and reproductive success. Male-male affiliative relationship, such as coalitions/alliances, have been reported in social mammals and birds in situations where three or more individuals interact, suggesting that male-male affiliative relationships can be formed via interactive situations involving three (or more) individuals. However, no experimental studies have tested this hypothesis on social animals. Many studies on mammals and birds have revealed that an affiliative relationship is underpinned by the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin (VP) system. However, the role of the OT/VP system has been studied only in parent-offspring bonds and pair-bonds and is lacking in male-male affiliative relationships. In this study, we found the 2-week cohabitation of three male crows in an aviary facilitated affiliative relationship formation between two of the three crows (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of peripheral administration of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist peripheral administration on the social behaviour of affiliated males. We found that the V1aR antagonist caused the disappearance of affiliative behaviour and the resurgence of agonistic behaviour in affiliated males. Our findings provide the first evidence for V1aR involvement in male-male affiliative relationships in vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many recent studies indicate that control of decisions and actions is integrated during interactive behavior. Among these, several carried out in humans and monkeys conclude that there is a co-regulation of choices and movements. Another perspective, based on human data only, proposes a decoupled control of decision duration and movement speed, allowing for instance to trade decision duration for movement duration when time pressure increases. Crucially, it is not currently known whether this ability to flexibly dissociate decision duration from movement speed is specific to humans, whether it can vary depending on the context in which a task is performed, and whether it is stable over time. These are important questions to address, especially to rely on monkey electrophysiology to infer the neural mechanisms of decision-action coordination in humans. To do so, we trained two macaque monkeys in a perceptual decision-making task and analyzed data collected over multiple behavioral sessions. Our findings reveal a strong and complex relationship between decision duration and movement vigor. Decision duration and action duration can co-vary but also &#34;compensate&#34; each other. Such integrated but decoupled control of decisions and actions aligns with recent studies in humans, validating the monkey model in electrophysiology as a means of inferring neural mechanisms in humans. Crucially, we demonstrate for the first time that this control can evolve with experience, in an adapted manner. Together, the present findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the integrated control of decisions and actions during interactive behavior.

New &amp; noteworthyThe mechanism by which the integrated control of decisions and actions occurs, coupled or interactive but decoupled, is debated. In the present study, we show in monkeys that decisions and actions influence each other in a decoupled way. For the first time, we also demonstrate that this control can evolve depending the subjects experience, allowing to trade movement time for decision time and limit the temporal discounting of reward value.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The  classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-&amp;gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apathy is a complex psychiatric syndrome characterised by motivational deficit, emotional blunting and cognitive changes. It occurs alongside a broad range of neurological disorders, but also occurs in otherwise healthy ageing. Despite its clinical prevalence, apathy does not yet have a designated treatment strategy. Generation of a translational animal model of apathy syndrome would facilitate the development of novel treatments. Given the multidimensional nature of apathy, a model cannot be achieved with a single behavioural test. Using a battery of behavioural tests we investigated whether aged rats exhibit behavioural deficits across different domains relevant to apathy. Using the effort for reward and progressive ratio tasks we found that aged rats (21-27 months) show intact reward motivation. Using the novelty supressed feeding test and position-based object exploration we found aged rats showed increased anxiety-like behaviour inconsistent with emotional blunting. The sucrose preference test and reward learning assay showed intact reward sensitivity and reward-related cognition in aged rats. However, using a bowl-digging version of the probabilistic reversal learning task, we found a deficit in cognitive flexibility in aged rats that did not translate across to a touchscreen version of the task. While these data reveal important changes in cognitive flexibility and anxiety associated with ageing, aged rats do not show deficits across other behavioural domains relevant to apathy. This suggests that aged rats are not a suitable model for age-related apathy syndrome. These findings contrast with previous work in mice, revealing important species differences in behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Novelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus coloured by risk-sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals&#39; differing prior expectations about reward and threat and degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk-sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behaviour of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena (Akiti et al. Neuron 110, 2022). We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (stereotyped tail-behind) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. We find that &#34;brave&#34; animals, though varied in their behavior, generally are more risk neutral, and enjoy a flexible hazard prior. They begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward. On the other hand, &#34;timid&#34; animals, characterized by risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors, display self-censoring that leads to the sort of asymptotic maladaptive behavior that is often associated with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities in humans and other animals.</p>
