In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nEvidence for interacting but decoupled controls of decisions and movements in non-human primates\nAuthors: Saleri, C.; Thura, D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577721\nMany recent studies indicate that control of decisions and actions is integrated during interactive behavior. Among these, several carried out in humans and monkeys conclude that there is a co-regulation of choices and movements. Another perspective, based on human data only, proposes a decoupled control of decision duration and movement speed, allowing for instance to trade decision duration for movement duration when time pressure increases. Crucially, it is not currently known whether this ability to flexibly dissociate decision duration from movement speed is specific to humans, whether it can vary depending on the context in which a task is performed, and whether it is stable over time. These are important questions to address, especially to rely on monkey electrophysiology to infer the neural mechanisms of decision-action coordination in humans. To do so, we trained two macaque monkeys in a perceptual decision-making task and analyzed data collected over multiple behavioral sessions. Our findings reveal a strong and complex relationship between decision duration and movement vigor. Decision duration and action duration can co-vary but also \"compensate\" each other. Such integrated but decoupled control of decisions and actions aligns with recent studies in humans, validating the monkey model in electrophysiology as a means of inferring neural mechanisms in humans. Crucially, we demonstrate for the first time that this control can evolve with experience, in an adapted manner. Together, the present findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the integrated control of decisions and actions during interactive behavior. New \u0026 noteworthyThe mechanism by which the integrated control of decisions and actions occurs, coupled or interactive but decoupled, is debated. In the present study, we show in monkeys that decisions and actions influence each other in a decoupled way. For the first time, we also demonstrate that this control can evolve depending the subjects experience, allowing to trade movement time for decision time and limit the temporal discounting of reward value.\nBold zebrafish (danio rerio) learn faster in an associative learning task\nAuthors: Corcoran, J.; Storks, L.; Wong, R. Y.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578005\nAnimals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.\nPregnancy-associated oxidative stress and inflammation are not associated with impaired maternal neuronal activity or memory function\nAuthors: Bradshaw, J. L.; Wilson, E. N.; Gardner, J. J.; Mabry, S.; Tucker, S. M.; Rybalchenko, N.; Vera, E.; Goulopoulou, S.; Cunningham, R. L.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577461\nPregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX(R) magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [\u0026le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [\u0026le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [\u0026le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.\nTapeworm infection affects sleep behavior in three-spined stickleback\nAuthors: Bauhus, M. B.; Mews, S.; Kurtz, J.; Brinker, A.; Peuss, R.; Anaya-Rojas, J. M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577962\nSleep is a highly complex and conserved biological process that affects several body functions and behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that there is a reciprocal interaction between sleep and immunity. For instance, fragmented sleep can increase the probability of parasitic infections and reduce the ability of infected hosts to fight infections. It is also known, particularly in humans and other mammals, that viral and bacterial infections alter the sleep patterns of infected individuals. However, the effects of macro-parasitic infections on sleep remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether macro-parasite infections could alter the sleep of their hosts. We experimentally infected three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus and used a hidden Markov model to characterize sleep-associated behaviors in the sticklebacks. At an early time-point, 1-4 days after parasite exposure, infected fish showed no difference in sleep compared with non-exposed fish, whereas fish that were exposed but could fend off the infection slept less during the daytime. At a later time-point, 29-32 days after exposure, infected fish slept more than uninfected fish, while exposed-but-not-infected fish slept less than non-exposed fish. Using RNA-seq of brain tissue, we identified several immune- and sleep-associated genes that potentially underlie the observed behavioral changes. These results provide the first insight into the complex association between macro-parasite infection, immunity, and sleep in fish and may thus contribute to a better understanding of the reciprocal interaction between sleep and immunity.\nProjections from thalamic nucleus reuniens to hippocampal CA1 area enable context value updating\nAuthors: Ziołkowska, M.; Sotoudeh, N.; Cały, A.; Puchalska, M.; Pagano, R.; Sliwinska, M. A.; Salamian, A.; Radwanska, K.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578155\nThe ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-\u0026gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.\nNon-contact detection of pyrethroids widely used in vector control by Anopheles mosquitoes\nAuthors: KAMBOU, S. S.; VALENTE, A.; AGNEW, P.; Hien, D. F. d. S.; YERBANGA, R. S.; MOIROUX, N.; DABIRE, K. R.; PENNETIER, C.; COHUET, A.; CARRASCO, D.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577675\nPyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides to control vector borne diseases including malaria. Physiological resistance mechanisms to these insecticides have been well described, whereas those for behavioral resistance remain overlooked. Field data suggest the presence of spatial sensory detection by Anopheles mosquitoes of the pyrethroid molecules used in insecticide-based control tools, such as long-lasting insecticide nets or insecticide residual spraying, opening the way to the emergence of a wide range of behavioral adaptations among malaria vectors. However, the spatial sensory detection of these molecules is controversial and needs to be demonstrated. The goal of this study was to behaviorally characterize the non-contact detection of three of the most common pyrethroids used for malaria vector control: permethrin, deltamethrin an -cypermethrin. To reach this goal, we recorded the behavior (takeoff response) of Anopheles gambiae pyrethroid-sensitive and resistant laboratory strains, as well as field collected mosquitoes from the Gambiae complex, when exposed to the headspace of bottles containing different doses of the insecticides at 25 and 35{degrees}C, in order to represent a range of laboratory and field temperatures. We found the proportion of laboratory susceptible and resistant female mosquitoes that took off was, in all treatments, dose and the temperature dependent. Sensitive mosquitoes were significantly more prone to take off only in the presence of -cypermethrin, whereas sensitive and resistant mosquitoes showed similar responses to permethrin and deltamethrin. Field-collected mosquitoes of the Gambiae complex were also responsive to permethrin, independently of the species identity (An. gambiae, An. coluzzi and An. arabiensis) or their genotypes for the kdr mutation, known to confer resistance to pyrethroids. The observed ability of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes to detect insecticides without contact could favor the evolution of behavioral modifications that may allow them to avoid or reduce the adverse effect of insecticides and thus, the development of behavioral resistance.\nRisking your Tail: Modeling Individual Differences in Risk-sensitive Exploration using Conditional Value at Risk and Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Processes\nAuthors: Shen, T.; Dayan, P.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574574\nNovelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus coloured by risk-sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals differing prior expectations about reward and threat and degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk-sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behaviour of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena (Akiti et al. Neuron 110, 2022). We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (stereotyped tail-behind) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. We find that \"brave\" animals, though varied in their behavior, generally are more risk neutral, and enjoy a flexible hazard prior. They begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward. On the other hand, \"timid\" animals, characterized by risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors, display self-censoring that leads to the sort of asymptotic maladaptive behavior that is often associated with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities in humans and other animals. Author summaryAnimals face a dilemma when they encounter novel objects in their environment. Approaching and investigating an object could lead to reward in the form of food, play, etc. but it also exposes the animal to dangers such as predation. Experiments have shown that animals solve this exploration dilemma by using intermittent strategies (alternately approaching the object and then retreating to a safe location) that gradually increase their level of risk. We built an abstract model of these exploration strategies and fit the model to the behavior of 26 mice freely exploring a novel object in an arena. Our model accounts for the high-level physical and mental states of the mice, the actions the mice can take, and beliefs about the uncertain consequences of those actions. Our model provides a rational explanation for individual differences seen in experiments: individuals maximize their utility given different prior beliefs about the dangers and the rewards in the environment, and different tendencies to overestimate the probability of bad outcomes. Modeling individual differences in risk-sensitivity during exploration could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression in humans and animals.\nCan we trace the social affiliation of rooks (Corvusfrugilegus) through their vocal signature?\nAuthors: Martin, K.; Cornero, F. M.; Danby, E.; Daunay, V.; Nervet, L.; Clayton, N. S.; Obin, N.; Dufour, V.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577907\nInter-individual recognition is crucial for stable social relationships and it is frequently mediated through vocal signatures. In socially complex species, recognition may additionally require additional levels corresponding to other layers of social organisation such as the pair, family, social group or colony. Additional vocal signatures may encode these different levels of social organisations for recognition. We investigated this hypothesis in the calls of the rook (Corvus frugilegus), a highly social corvid. Rooks form large breeding colonies where multiple pairs nest in clusters. We recorded the calls of five colonies located in France and in Great Britain, including both wild and captive colonies. To exclude variations due to different call types, we focused on the loud nest call produced exclusively by nesting females during the breeding season. We compared the acoustic distance of calls from each individual and between individuals at various levels of nest proximity, i.e. from the same nest cluster, from different nest clusters, from colonies within the same country, and from colonies in different countries. The only vocal signatures we found were at the individual level, but not at the nest cluster or colony level. This suggests a lack of vocal convergence in this species, at least for the nest call, which may be important for pair recognition in large colonies. Further studies should now evaluate if types of calls other than the nest call better carry vocal signatures as markers of different layers of sociality in this species, or if vocal divergence is a more general vocal phenomenon. In that case, applying new methods of monitoring vocal signatures in wild individuals should help understand the cognitive, social and environmental mechanisms underlying this vocal singularisation. 1. Significance statementInter-individual recognition is crucial for social relationships in animals, and is often mediated by individual-specific acoustic characteristics in vocalisations, called a vocal signature. High levels of social organisations, such as a social group of familiar conspecifics or a breeding colony, may likewise be signalled by vocal signatures shared by multiple individuals. We used machine-learning techniques to investigate vocal signatures at multiple social levels in the nest call of brooding female rooks, a corvid species that breeds colonially but lives year-round in social groups. We find evidence of a strong individual vocal signature, but no common vocal signature even in females that nest close together, or in the same colony. A strong individual vocal signature may be a potent tool to monitor populations in this species with minimal disturbance and minimal material, especially as corvids are frequently targeted by human-fauna conflicts in continental Europe.\nFrom small to tall: breed-varied household pet dogs can be trained to detect Parkinson's Disease\nAuthors: Holt, L.; Johnston, S. V.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577858\nObjectiveParkinsons Disease (PD) is a clinically diagnosed disease that carries a reported misdiagnosis rate of 10-20%. Recent scientific discoveries have provided evidence of volatile organic compounds in sebum that are unique to patients with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine if companion dogs could be trained to distinguish between sebum samples provided by PD-positive patients and PD-negative human controls. MethodsThis was a randomized, handler-blind, controlled study. Twenty-three canines of varying breeds, ages, and environmental backgrounds were included. The two-year study period reported here was the final two years of a seven-year program which started in January of 2016. This study encompassed 200 total working session days from 2021 and 2022. ResultsWhen averaged as a group over two years, the 23 dogs were 89% sensitive and 87% specific to an olfactory distinction between PD-positive and PD-negative human donor samples. Ten of the twenty-three dogs averaged 90% or higher in both sensitivity and specificity. In 161 separate instances, dogs were presented with both unique PD-positive and PD-negative samples (the dogs had not previously encountered any of the samples presented). For these first-time exposures, the 23 dogs collectively averaged 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity. When comparing the sensitivity and specificity of PD-positive samples from donors who reported levodopa usage to PD-positive samples from donors who reported no levodopa usage, the dogs showed no statistical difference in sensitivity or specificity at the 95% significance level, indicating levodopa usage is not a factor in PD canine detection. Other factors investigated as part of this study included sample donor gender, canine breed, age, duration of time in the program, and training. ConclusionsCompanion dogs can be trained with reward-biased detection methodologies to distinguish between PD-positive and PD-negative donor sebum samples in a controlled setting. This study provides further evidence of one or more volatile organic compounds in the sebum of PD-positive patients that can be detected by canines. Summarily, study findings support the application of trained companion dogs for the screening of PD-positive and PD-negative samples in which numbers of samples are limited and the dogs are worked in short intervals, followed by recovery training.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many recent studies indicate that control of decisions and actions is integrated during interactive behavior. Among these, several carried out in humans and monkeys conclude that there is a co-regulation of choices and movements. Another perspective, based on human data only, proposes a decoupled control of decision duration and movement speed, allowing for instance to trade decision duration for movement duration when time pressure increases. Crucially, it is not currently known whether this ability to flexibly dissociate decision duration from movement speed is specific to humans, whether it can vary depending on the context in which a task is performed, and whether it is stable over time. These are important questions to address, especially to rely on monkey electrophysiology to infer the neural mechanisms of decision-action coordination in humans. To do so, we trained two macaque monkeys in a perceptual decision-making task and analyzed data collected over multiple behavioral sessions. Our findings reveal a strong and complex relationship between decision duration and movement vigor. Decision duration and action duration can co-vary but also &#34;compensate&#34; each other. Such integrated but decoupled control of decisions and actions aligns with recent studies in humans, validating the monkey model in electrophysiology as a means of inferring neural mechanisms in humans. Crucially, we demonstrate for the first time that this control can evolve with experience, in an adapted manner. Together, the present findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the integrated control of decisions and actions during interactive behavior.

New &amp; noteworthyThe mechanism by which the integrated control of decisions and actions occurs, coupled or interactive but decoupled, is debated. In the present study, we show in monkeys that decisions and actions influence each other in a decoupled way. For the first time, we also demonstrate that this control can evolve depending the subjects experience, allowing to trade movement time for decision time and limit the temporal discounting of reward value.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX(R) magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [&amp;le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [&amp;le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [&amp;le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep is a highly complex and conserved biological process that affects several body functions and behaviors. Recent evidence suggests that there is a reciprocal interaction between sleep and immunity. For instance, fragmented sleep can increase the probability of parasitic infections and reduce the ability of infected hosts to fight infections. It is also known, particularly in humans and other mammals, that viral and bacterial infections alter the sleep patterns of infected individuals. However, the effects of macro-parasitic infections on sleep remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether macro-parasite infections could alter the sleep of their hosts. We experimentally infected three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus and used a hidden Markov model to characterize sleep-associated behaviors in the sticklebacks. At an early time-point, 1-4 days after parasite exposure, infected fish showed no difference in sleep compared with non-exposed fish, whereas fish that were exposed but could fend off the infection slept less during the daytime. At a later time-point, 29-32 days after exposure, infected fish slept more than uninfected fish, while exposed-but-not-infected fish slept less than non-exposed fish. Using RNA-seq of brain tissue, we identified several immune- and sleep-associated genes that potentially underlie the observed behavioral changes. These results provide the first insight into the complex association between macro-parasite infection, immunity, and sleep in fish and may thus contribute to a better understanding of the reciprocal interaction between sleep and immunity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The  classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-&amp;gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides to control vector borne diseases including malaria. Physiological resistance mechanisms to these insecticides have been well described, whereas those for behavioral resistance remain overlooked. Field data suggest the presence of spatial sensory detection by Anopheles mosquitoes of the pyrethroid molecules used in insecticide-based control tools, such as long-lasting insecticide nets or insecticide residual spraying, opening the way to the emergence of a wide range of behavioral adaptations among malaria vectors. However, the spatial sensory detection of these molecules is controversial and needs to be demonstrated. The goal of this study was to behaviorally characterize the non-contact detection of three of the most common pyrethroids used for malaria vector control: permethrin, deltamethrin an -cypermethrin.

To reach this goal, we recorded the behavior (takeoff response) of Anopheles gambiae pyrethroid-sensitive and resistant laboratory strains, as well as field collected mosquitoes from the Gambiae complex, when exposed to the headspace of bottles containing different doses of the insecticides at 25 and 35{degrees}C, in order to represent a range of laboratory and field temperatures.

We found the proportion of laboratory susceptible and resistant female mosquitoes that took off was, in all treatments, dose and the temperature dependent. Sensitive mosquitoes were significantly more prone to take off only in the presence of -cypermethrin, whereas sensitive and resistant mosquitoes showed similar responses to permethrin and deltamethrin. Field-collected mosquitoes of the Gambiae complex were also responsive to permethrin, independently of the species identity (An. gambiae, An. coluzzi and An. arabiensis) or their genotypes for the kdr mutation, known to confer resistance to pyrethroids.

The observed ability of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes to detect insecticides without contact could favor the evolution of behavioral modifications that may allow them to avoid or reduce the adverse effect of insecticides and thus, the development of behavioral resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Novelty is a double-edged sword for agents and animals alike: they might benefit from untapped resources or face unexpected costs or dangers such as predation. The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus coloured by risk-sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals differing prior expectations about reward and threat and degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk-sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behaviour of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena (Akiti et al. Neuron 110, 2022). We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (stereotyped tail-behind) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. We find that &#34;brave&#34; animals, though varied in their behavior, generally are more risk neutral, and enjoy a flexible hazard prior. They begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward. On the other hand, &#34;timid&#34; animals, characterized by risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors, display self-censoring that leads to the sort of asymptotic maladaptive behavior that is often associated with psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Explaining risk-sensitive exploration using factorized parameters of reinforcement learning models could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric abnormalities in humans and other animals.

Author summaryAnimals face a dilemma when they encounter novel objects in their environment. Approaching and investigating an object could lead to reward in the form of food, play, etc. but it also exposes the animal to dangers such as predation. Experiments have shown that animals solve this exploration dilemma by using intermittent strategies (alternately approaching the object and then retreating to a safe location) that gradually increase their level of risk. We built an abstract model of these exploration strategies and fit the model to the behavior of 26 mice freely exploring a novel object in an arena. Our model accounts for the high-level physical and mental states of the mice, the actions the mice can take, and beliefs about the uncertain consequences of those actions. Our model provides a rational explanation for individual differences seen in experiments: individuals maximize their utility given different prior beliefs about the dangers and the rewards in the environment, and different tendencies to overestimate the probability of bad outcomes. Modeling individual differences in risk-sensitivity during exploration could aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression in humans and animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Inter-individual recognition is crucial for stable social relationships and it is frequently mediated through vocal signatures. In socially complex species, recognition may additionally require additional levels corresponding to other layers of social organisation such as the pair, family, social group or colony. Additional vocal signatures may encode these different levels of social organisations for recognition. We investigated this hypothesis in the calls of the rook (Corvus frugilegus), a highly social corvid. Rooks form large breeding colonies where multiple pairs nest in clusters. We recorded the calls of five colonies located in France and in Great Britain, including both wild and captive colonies. To exclude variations due to different call types, we focused on the loud nest call produced exclusively by nesting females during the breeding season. We compared the acoustic distance of calls from each individual and between individuals at various levels of nest proximity, i.e. from the same nest cluster, from different nest clusters, from colonies within the same country, and from colonies in different countries. The only vocal signatures we found were at the individual level, but not at the nest cluster or colony level. This suggests a lack of vocal convergence in this species, at least for the nest call, which may be important for pair recognition in large colonies. Further studies should now evaluate if types of calls other than the nest call better carry vocal signatures as markers of different layers of sociality in this species, or if vocal divergence is a more general vocal phenomenon. In that case, applying new methods of monitoring vocal signatures in wild individuals should help understand the cognitive, social and environmental mechanisms underlying this vocal singularisation.

1. Significance statementInter-individual recognition is crucial for social relationships in animals, and is often mediated by individual-specific acoustic characteristics in vocalisations, called a vocal signature. High levels of social organisations, such as a social group of familiar conspecifics or a breeding colony, may likewise be signalled by vocal signatures shared by multiple individuals. We used machine-learning techniques to investigate vocal signatures at multiple social levels in the nest call of brooding female rooks, a corvid species that breeds colonially but lives year-round in social groups. We find evidence of a strong individual vocal signature, but no common vocal signature even in females that nest close together, or in the same colony. A strong individual vocal signature may be a potent tool to monitor populations in this species with minimal disturbance and minimal material, especially as corvids are frequently targeted by human-fauna conflicts in continental Europe.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveParkinsons Disease (PD) is a clinically diagnosed disease that carries a reported misdiagnosis rate of 10-20%. Recent scientific discoveries have provided evidence of volatile organic compounds in sebum that are unique to patients with PD. The purpose of this study was to determine if companion dogs could be trained to distinguish between sebum samples provided by PD-positive patients and PD-negative human controls.

MethodsThis was a randomized, handler-blind, controlled study. Twenty-three canines of varying breeds, ages, and environmental backgrounds were included. The two-year study period reported here was the final two years of a seven-year program which started in January of 2016. This study encompassed 200 total working session days from 2021 and 2022.

ResultsWhen averaged as a group over two years, the 23 dogs were 89% sensitive and 87% specific to an olfactory distinction between PD-positive and PD-negative human donor samples. Ten of the twenty-three dogs averaged 90% or higher in both sensitivity and specificity.

In 161 separate instances, dogs were presented with both unique PD-positive and PD-negative samples (the dogs had not previously encountered any of the samples presented). For these first-time exposures, the 23 dogs collectively averaged 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity.

When comparing the sensitivity and specificity of PD-positive samples from donors who reported levodopa usage to PD-positive samples from donors who reported no levodopa usage, the dogs showed no statistical difference in sensitivity or specificity at the 95% significance level, indicating levodopa usage is not a factor in PD canine detection. Other factors investigated as part of this study included sample donor gender, canine breed, age, duration of time in the program, and training.

ConclusionsCompanion dogs can be trained with reward-biased detection methodologies to distinguish between PD-positive and PD-negative donor sebum samples in a controlled setting. This study provides further evidence of one or more volatile organic compounds in the sebum of PD-positive patients that can be detected by canines. Summarily, study findings support the application of trained companion dogs for the screening of PD-positive and PD-negative samples in which numbers of samples are limited and the dogs are worked in short intervals, followed by recovery training.</p>
