R.; Eggert, A.; Manteuffel, C.; Rault, J.-L.\nScore: 117.8, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.17.533160\nHelping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.\nAn adaptable, user-friendly score sheet to monitor welfare in experimental fish\nAuthors: Flueck, M.; Schmidt-Posthaus, H.; Bergadano, A.; Adrian-Kalchhauser, I.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549642\nFish are increasingly used as experimental animals in a wide range of research fields. As of 2022, a quarter of all experimental animals used in Europe are fish, with an upward trend. At the same time, less than 20% of these are zebrafish. At the same time, welfare assessments for experimental fish are in their infancy compared to rodents. This can be attributed to the diversity of species used, the relative recency of fish as go-to model for research, and challenges to assess welfare and pain in non-vocal underwater species. The lack of assessment guidelines and easy-to-use tools is a challenge for researchers (particularly, for newcomers to the field of fish), for ethics committees, and prevents the rigorous implementation of the 3Rs (particularly, refinement). Here, we present an adaptable, user-friendly scoring tool for fish. The parameters contained in the tool are based on a literature review, have been validated by expert interviews, and weighted by a fish pathologist. The tool allows to score individuals as well as groups and provides a visualization of trends. We provide the associated literature and give detailed examples and instructions on the adaptation and use of the scoring tool. We hope that this tool to score fish welfare will empower researchers to include welfare assessment in their routines, foster discussions on fish welfare parameters among scientists, facilitate interactions with ethics committees, and most importantly, enable continuous refinement of fish experiments.\nKin-recognition shapes collective behaviors in the cannibalistic nematode Pristionchus pacificus\nAuthors: Hiramatsu, F.; Lightfoot, J. W.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549064\nKin-recognition is observed across diverse species forming an important behavioral adaptation influencing organismal interactions. In most species, proximate level mechanisms are poorly characterized, but in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus molecular components regulating its kin-recognition system have been identified which determine its predatory behaviors. This ability prevents the killing of kin however, its impact on other interactions including collective behaviors is unknown. Utilizing pairwise aggregation assays between distinct strains of P. pacificus, we observed aggregation between kin but not distantly related con-specifics. In these assays, only one strain aggregates with solitary behavior induced in the rival. Abolishing predation through Ppa-nhr-40 mutations results in rival strains successfully aggregating together. Additionally, interactions between P. pacificus populations and Caenorhabditis elegans are dominated by P. pacificus which also disrupts C. elegans aggregation dynamics. Thus, aggregating strains of P. pacificus preferentially group with kin, revealing competition and nepotism as previously unknown components influencing collective behaviors in nematodes.\nNeuromolecular responses in disrupted mutualistic cleaning interactions under future environmental conditions\nAuthors: Ramirez-Calero, S. P.; Paula, J. R.; Otjacques, E.; Ravasi, T.; Rosa, R.; Schunter, C.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549851\nMutualistic interactions, which constitute some of the most advantageous interactions among fish species, are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. A key mutualistic interaction is the cleaning service rendered by the cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which involves intricate processes of social behaviour to remove ectoparasites from client fish and can be altered in near-future environmental conditions. Here, we evaluated the neuromolecular mechanisms behind the behavioural disruption of cleaning interactions in response to future environments. We subjected cleaner wrasses and surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon, serving as clients) to elevated temperature (Warming, 32oC), increased levels of CO2 (High CO2, 1000 ppm), and a combined condition of elevated CO2 and temperature (Warming \u0026 High CO2, 32oC \u0026 1000 ppm) for 28 days. Each of these conditions resulted in behavioural disruptions concerning the motivation to interact and the quality of interaction (High CO2 -80.7%, Warming -92.6%, Warming \u0026 High CO2 -79.5%, p\u003c0.001). Using transcriptomic of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, we discovered that most transcriptional reprogramming in both species under warming conditions occurred primarily in the hind- and forebrain. The associated functions under warming were linked to stress, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, and behaviour. In contrast, elevated CO2 exposure affected a range of functions associated with GABA, behaviour, visual perception, and circadian rhythm. Interestingly, in the combined Warming \u0026 High CO2 condition, we did not observe any expression changes of behaviour. However, we did find signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, suggesting not only an additive effect of the environmental conditions but also a trade-off between physiological performance and behaviour in the cleaner wrasse. We suggest that impending environmental shifts can affect the behaviour and molecular processes that sustain mutualistic interactions between L. dimidiatus and its clients, which could have a cascading effect on their adaptation potential and possibly cause large-scale impacts on coral reef ecosystems.\nSocial influences on delayed gratification in New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays\nAuthors: Miller, R.; Davies, J.; Schiestl, M.; Garcia-Pelegrin, E.; Gray, R. D.; Taylor, A. H.; Clayton, N. S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549039\nSelf-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.\nA mouse model of ATRX deficiency with cognitive deficits and autistic traits\nAuthors: Quesnel, K. M.; Martin-Kenny, N.; Berube, N. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549759\nATRX is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein with essential roles in safeguarding genome integrity and modulating gene expression. Deficiencies in this protein cause ATR-X syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and an array of developmental abnormalities, including features of autism. Previous studies demonstrated that deleting ATRX in mouse forebrain excitatory neurons postnatally resulted in male-specific memory deficits. Here, we introduce a new model where ATRX is deleted at earlier embryonic stages, resulting in a broader spectrum of impairments, including contextual fear memory deficits, decreased anxiety, hyperactivity, as well as self-injurious and stereotyped behaviours. Sex-specific alterations were also observed, with males displaying heightened aggression and impaired sensory gating, while females exhibit social avoidance. Collectively, the findings indicate that early developmental abnormalities arising from ATRX deficiency in neurons contribute to of the presentation of autistic-like behaviours.\nIndividuals lack the capacity to accurately detect emotional piloerection\nAuthors: McPhetres, J.; Han, A.; Gao, H. H.; Kemp, N.; Khati, B.; Pu, C. X.; Smith, A.; Shui, X.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549671\nPiloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection, often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences, its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being \"emotionally moved\" and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.\nRate dependent effects of SKF 38393 and amphetamine on waiting impulsivity in the 5C-CPT\nAuthors: Abdulkader, S. P.; Neill, J.; Gigg, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.15.549161\nRationaleADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by inattention and impulsivity. Stimulants such as amphetamine are the most common pharmacological treatment for ADHD. However, such stimulants have substantial abuse and dependence risk. For example, stimulants (smart pills) are commonly used by students to enhance academic performance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic agents. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system has been associated with ADHD symptoms. D1 receptors play an important role in the cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants and thus may provide a therapeutic target. Previous pre-clinical studies have shown that selective activation of D1 receptors improves sustained attention in the 5C-CPT without improving waiting impulsivity. The present study extends this work to investigate the effect of selective activation of D1 receptors on waiting impulsivity as measured by 5C-CPT. ObjectiveThe aim of the present experiment was to compare the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 to a standard ADHD treatment (amphetamine) on waiting impulsivity in the 5C-CPT under extended inter-trial intervals. MethodsAdult female Lister hooded rats were trained to criterion in the 5C-CPT. After rats were able to distinguish target from non-target trials the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 (2-6 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) were investigated under behavioural manipulations to challenge inhibitory response control and, to a lesser extent, attentional resources. The traditional method of analysing drug effects on group data (or sub-groups of high and low performers) was compared with correlational analysis using Oldham method to determine if drug treatment affected waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner. ResultsThe highest dose of SKF 38393 selectively improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention or response inhibition. The two highest doses of amphetamine improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention and response inhibition. ConclusionsThe effects of AMPH on waiting impulsivity further supports the predictive validity of 5C-CPT. In addition, this study taken together with previous studies which report pro attentional effects of D1 receptor agonists suggests that D1 selective agonists could be therapeutically beneficial in ADHD patients. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects. This is the first study to take advantage of the variation in individual baseline waiting impulsivity to demonstrate the presence of a rate-dependent relationship between baseline waiting impulsivity and magnitude of improvement following stimulant or non-stimulant medications. Oldhams correlation method may present an opportunity to enhance the translational value of research in the preclinical laboratory to the clinic. Furthermore, these findings further support the ability of 5C-CPT to distinguish between response inhibition and waiting impulsivity and allow symptom specific treatment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Helping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fish are increasingly used as experimental animals in a wide range of research fields. As of 2022, a quarter of all experimental animals used in Europe are fish, with an upward trend. At the same time, less than 20% of these are zebrafish. At the same time, welfare assessments for experimental fish are in their infancy compared to rodents. This can be attributed to the diversity of species used, the relative recency of fish as go-to model for research, and challenges to assess welfare and pain in non-vocal underwater species. The lack of assessment guidelines and easy-to-use tools is a challenge for researchers (particularly, for newcomers to the field of fish), for ethics committees, and prevents the rigorous implementation of the 3Rs (particularly, refinement). Here, we present an adaptable, user-friendly scoring tool for fish. The parameters contained in the tool are based on a literature review, have been validated by expert interviews, and weighted by a fish pathologist. The tool allows to score individuals as well as groups and provides a visualization of trends. We provide the associated literature and give detailed examples and instructions on the adaptation and use of the scoring tool. We hope that this tool to score fish welfare will empower researchers to include welfare assessment in their routines, foster discussions on fish welfare parameters among scientists, facilitate interactions with ethics committees, and most importantly, enable continuous refinement of fish experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kin-recognition is observed across diverse species forming an important behavioral adaptation influencing organismal interactions. In most species, proximate level mechanisms are poorly characterized, but in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus molecular components regulating its kin-recognition system have been identified which determine its predatory behaviors. This ability prevents the killing of kin however, its impact on other interactions including collective behaviors is unknown. Utilizing pairwise aggregation assays between distinct strains of P. pacificus, we observed aggregation between kin but not distantly related con-specifics. In these assays, only one strain aggregates with solitary behavior induced in the rival. Abolishing predation through Ppa-nhr-40 mutations results in rival strains successfully aggregating together. Additionally, interactions between P. pacificus populations and Caenorhabditis elegans are dominated by P. pacificus which also disrupts C. elegans aggregation dynamics. Thus, aggregating strains of P. pacificus preferentially group with kin, revealing competition and nepotism as previously unknown components influencing collective behaviors in nematodes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutualistic interactions, which constitute some of the most advantageous interactions among fish species, are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. A key mutualistic interaction is the cleaning service rendered by the cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which involves intricate processes of social behaviour to remove ectoparasites from client fish and can be altered in near-future environmental conditions. Here, we evaluated the neuromolecular mechanisms behind the behavioural disruption of cleaning interactions in response to future environments. We subjected cleaner wrasses and surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon, serving as clients) to elevated temperature (Warming, 32oC), increased levels of CO2 (High CO2, 1000 ppm), and a combined condition of elevated CO2 and temperature (Warming &amp; High CO2, 32oC &amp; 1000 ppm) for 28 days. Each of these conditions resulted in behavioural disruptions concerning the motivation to interact and the quality of interaction (High CO2 -80.7%, Warming -92.6%, Warming &amp; High CO2 -79.5%, p&lt;0.001). Using transcriptomic of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, we discovered that most transcriptional reprogramming in both species under warming conditions occurred primarily in the hind- and forebrain. The associated functions under warming were linked to stress, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, and behaviour. In contrast, elevated CO2 exposure affected a range of functions associated with GABA, behaviour, visual perception, and circadian rhythm. Interestingly, in the combined Warming &amp; High CO2 condition, we did not observe any expression changes of behaviour. However, we did find signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, suggesting not only an additive effect of the environmental conditions but also a trade-off between physiological performance and behaviour in the cleaner wrasse. We suggest that impending environmental shifts can affect the behaviour and molecular processes that sustain mutualistic interactions between L. dimidiatus and its clients, which could have a cascading effect on their adaptation potential and possibly cause large-scale impacts on coral reef ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the  rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ATRX is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein with essential roles in safeguarding genome integrity and modulating gene expression. Deficiencies in this protein cause ATR-X syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and an array of developmental abnormalities, including features of autism. Previous studies demonstrated that deleting ATRX in mouse forebrain excitatory neurons postnatally resulted in male-specific memory deficits. Here, we introduce a new model where ATRX is deleted at earlier embryonic stages, resulting in a broader spectrum of impairments, including contextual fear memory deficits, decreased anxiety, hyperactivity, as well as self-injurious and stereotyped behaviours. Sex-specific alterations were also observed, with males displaying heightened aggression and impaired sensory gating, while females exhibit social avoidance. Collectively, the findings indicate that early developmental abnormalities arising from ATRX deficiency in neurons contribute to of the presentation of autistic-like behaviours.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection, often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences, its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being &#34;emotionally moved&#34; and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleADHD is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by inattention and impulsivity. Stimulants such as amphetamine are the most common pharmacological treatment for ADHD. However, such stimulants have substantial abuse and dependence risk. For example, stimulants (smart pills) are commonly used by students to enhance academic performance. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new therapeutic agents. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic system has been associated with ADHD symptoms. D1 receptors play an important role in the cognitive enhancing effects of stimulants and thus may provide a therapeutic target. Previous pre-clinical studies have shown that selective activation of D1 receptors improves sustained attention in the 5C-CPT without improving waiting impulsivity. The present study extends this work to investigate the effect of selective activation of D1 receptors on waiting impulsivity as measured by 5C-CPT.

ObjectiveThe aim of the present experiment was to compare the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 to a standard ADHD treatment (amphetamine) on waiting impulsivity in the 5C-CPT under extended inter-trial intervals.

MethodsAdult female Lister hooded rats were trained to criterion in the 5C-CPT. After rats were able to distinguish target from non-target trials the effects of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 (2-6 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) were investigated under behavioural manipulations to challenge inhibitory response control and, to a lesser extent, attentional resources. The traditional method of analysing drug effects on group data (or sub-groups of high and low performers) was compared with correlational analysis using Oldham method to determine if drug treatment affected waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner.

ResultsThe highest dose of SKF 38393 selectively improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention or response inhibition. The two highest doses of amphetamine improved waiting impulsivity in a baseline dependent manner without having a significant effect on sustained attention and response inhibition.

ConclusionsThe effects of AMPH on waiting impulsivity further supports the predictive validity of 5C-CPT. In addition, this study taken together with previous studies which report pro attentional effects of D1 receptor agonists suggests that D1 selective agonists could be therapeutically beneficial in ADHD patients. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects. This is the first study to take advantage of the variation in individual baseline waiting impulsivity to demonstrate the presence of a rate-dependent relationship between baseline waiting impulsivity and magnitude of improvement following stimulant or non-stimulant medications. Oldhams correlation method may present an opportunity to enhance the translational value of research in the preclinical laboratory to the clinic. Furthermore, these findings further support the ability of 5C-CPT to distinguish between response inhibition and waiting impulsivity and allow symptom specific treatment.</p>
