Invertebrate PLB has been restricted to social or object interaction. Here we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that flies exhibit idiosyncratic carousel interactions that qualify as play-like behaviour. While some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others actively seek stimulation, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits to the carousel. We propose that flies voluntarily expose themselves to external forces to intentionally receive exafferent stimulation. Self stimulation provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration. One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek passive movement.

A.; Fristrup, K.; Lolchuragi, D. S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nBehavioural, physiological, and genetic drivers of coping\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Guojonsdottir, A. R.; Escriche Chova, P.; Middelburg, E.; Jackels, J.; de Groot, N. G.; Wallner, B.; Massen, J. J. M.; Pfluger, L. S.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555090\nAnimals regularly experience stressful situations, ranging from predation to social stress, yet successfully deal with them on most occasions. This adaptive mechanism, coping, reduces the adverse effects of stressors through behavioural and physiological efforts, failing to which may result in reduced fitness. However, considerable variation in coping is observed. Unlike in humans, coping is often considered a personality trait in non-human animals due to construct similarity, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. Besides, limited multidisciplinary research has rendered comprehending the drivers of coping in animals challenging. We assessed repetitive behavioural coping or coping styles (n=30), emotional arousal (n=12), and consistent inter-individual differences, i.e., personalities (n=32) of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using observations, ecologically relevant experiments, and infrared thermography. We finally investigated the association of coping with a Valine/Methionine polymorphism encoded by the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (n=26), which is widely known for its involvement in human stress regulation. Our findings suggest that personality and the presence of the human equivalent COMT Val158Met polymorphism in long-tailed macaques are associated with emotion-focused and problem-focused coping styles. These coping styles were consistent with emotional arousal as measured with infrared thermography. We discuss these proximate drivers of coping for a better understanding of its evolution in primates.\nThe hippocampus contributes to retroactive stimulus associations during trace fear conditioning\nAuthors: Puhger, K.; Crestani, A. P.; Diniz, C. R. A. F.; Wiltgen, B. J.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.17.512614\nBinding events that occur at different times is essential for memory formation. In trace fear conditioning, animals associate a tone and footshock despite no temporal overlap. The hippocampus is thought to mediate this learning by maintaining a memory of the tone until shock occurrence, however evidence for sustained hippocampal tone representations is lacking. Here we demonstrate a retrospective role for the hippocampus in trace fear conditioning. Bulk calcium imaging revealed sustained increases in CA1 activity after footshock that were not observed after tone termination. Optogenetic silencing of CA1 immediately after footshock impaired subsequent memory. Additionally, footshock increased the number of sharp wave-ripples compared to baseline during conditioning. Therefore, post-shock hippocampal activity likely supports learning by reactivating and linking latent tone and shock representations. These findings highlight an underappreciated function of post-trial hippocampal activity in enabling retroactive temporal associations during new learning, as opposed to persistent maintenance of stimulus representations.\nEarly life adversity has sex-dependent effects on survival across the lifespan in rhesus macaques\nAuthors: Patterson, S. K.; Andonov, E.; Arre, A. M.; Martinez, M. I.; Negron-Del Valle, J. E.; Petersen, R. M.; Phillips, D.; Rahman, A.; Ruiz-Lambides, A.; Villanueva, I.; Lea, A. J.; Snyder-Mackler, N.; Brent, L. J. N.; Higham, J. P.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555589\nExposure to adversity during early life is linked to lasting detrimental effects on evolutionary fitness across many taxa. However, due to the challenges of collecting longitudinal data, especially in species where one sex disperses, direct evidence from long-lived species remains relatively scarce. Here we test the effects of early life adversity on male and female longevity in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We leveraged six decades of data to quantify the relative importance of ten forms of early life adversity for 6,599 macaques (3,230 male, 3,369 female), with a smaller sample size (N=299) for one form of adversity (maternal social isolation) which required high-resolution behavioral data. We found that individuals who experienced more early life adversity died earlier than those who experienced less adversity. Mortality risk was highest during early life, defined as birth to four years old, suggesting acute survival effects of adversity, but heightened mortality risk was also present in macaques who survived to adulthood. Females and males were affected differently by some forms of adversity, and these differences might be driven by varying energetic demands, female philopatry, and male dispersal. By leveraging data on thousands of macaques collected over decades, our results show that the fitness consequences of early life adversity are not uniform across individuals but vary as a function of the type of adversity, timing, and social context, and thus contribute to our limited but growing understanding of the evolution of early life sensitivities in long-lived species.\nSystematic creation and phenotyping of Mendelian disease models in C. elegans: towards large-scale drug repurposing\nAuthors: O'Brien, T. J.; Barlow, I. L.; Feriani, L.; Brown, A. E.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554786\nThere are thousands of Mendelian diseases with more being discovered weekly and the majority have no approved treatments. To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype, however the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here we show that high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of C. elegans disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions in their human orthologs led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggests that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.\nWall-following: phylogenetic context of an enhanced behaviour in stygomorphic Sinocyclocheilus (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) cavefishes\nAuthors: Chen, B.; Dai, W.-Z.; Li, X.-L.; Mao, T.-R.; Liu, Y.; Pie, M. R.; Yang, J.; Meegaskumbura, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555641\nWith 75 known species, the freshwater fish genus Sinocyclocheilus is the largest cavefish radiation in the world, emerging as a model system for evolutionary studies. They show multiple adaptations for cave dwelling (stygomorphic adaptations), which include a range of traits such as eye degeneration (Normal-eyed, Microeyed and Eyeless), depigmentation of skin, and in some species, the presence of horns. Their behavioural adaptations to subterranean environments, however, are poorly understood. Wall-following (WF) behaviour, where an organism remains in close contact with the boundary demarcating its habitat when in the dark, is a peculiar behaviour observed in a wide range of animals and is enhanced in some cave dwellers. Hence, we hypothesize wall-following to be present also in Sinocyclocheilus, possibly enhanced in Eyeless species compared to species with visual cues (Normal / Microeyed species). Using 13 species representative of Sinocyclocheilus radiation and eye-morphs, we designed a series of assays, based on preexisting methods for Astyanax mexicanus behavioural experiments, to examine wall-following behaviour under three stimulation conditions. Our results indicate that eyeless species exhibit significantly enhanced levels of WF compared to Normal-eyed species, with Micro-eyed forms demonstrating intermediate levels. Using a mtDNA based dated phylogeny (chronogram with four clades A to D), we traced the degree of WF of these forms to outline common patterns. We show that intensity of WF behaviour is high in the subterranean clades (B \u0026 C) compared to clades with free-living species (A \u0026 D). Experiments on WF behaviour revealed that eyeless species are highly sensitive to vibrations, whereas normal-eyed species are the least sensitive. Since WF behaviour is present to some degree in all Sinocyclocheilus species, and given that these fishes evolved in the late Miocene, we identify this behaviour as being ancestral with WF enhancement related to cave occupation. Our results from this diversification scale study of cavefish behaviour suggest that enhanced wall-following behaviour may be a convergent trait across all stygomorphic cavefish lineages.\nSocial complexity affects cognitive abilities but not brain structure in a Poecilid fish\nAuthors: Triki, Z.; Zhou, T.; Argyriou, E.; Sousa de Novais, E.; Servant, O.; Kolm, N.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554009\nComplex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated \"Machiavellian\" strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.\nCase report on lethal dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an anthropogenic landscape\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Pithva, K.; Mohanty, S.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553455\nFor nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.\nSocial learning of a challenging two-step action sequence fulfils key criteria of cumulative culture in an insect\nAuthors: Bridges, A. D.; Royka, A.; Wilson, T.; Chittka, L.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555358\nCulture in non-human animals refers to behaviour that is socially learned and persists within a population over time. Human culture is notable in that it is cumulative: new innovations have built on previous ones over thousands of years. As a result, what is acquired via social learning often goes far beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover it during their lifetime. To date, no previous study has convincingly demonstrated this phenomenon in a non-human animal. Here, we show that bumblebees can learn from a trained demonstrator to open a novel, 3D-printed two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrators to perform the unrewarded first step of the behaviour without providing a temporary reward linked to this action: the reward then being removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observers learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever having been rewarded after the first step. This suggested that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to 're-innovate' via individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure over the course of 12 days. The temporal and spatial distance of the unrewarded first step from the reward appeared to inhibit acquisition of two-step box-opening via individual associative learning, but this limitation was overcome by the presence of a trained conspecific. To our knowledge, these results make bumblebees the first animal to demonstrate the ability to socially learn a behaviour that is beyond their ability to innovate individually. This finding challenges the prevailing opinion of the field, which generally considers cumulative culture, which is built on this capacity, to be unique to humans.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been restricted to social or object interaction. Here we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that flies exhibit idiosyncratic carousel interactions that qualify as play-like behaviour. While some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others actively seek stimulation, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits to the carousel. We propose that flies voluntarily expose themselves to external forces to intentionally receive exafferent stimulation. Self stimulation provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek passive movement.

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals regularly experience stressful situations, ranging from predation to social stress, yet successfully deal with them on most occasions. This adaptive mechanism, coping, reduces the adverse effects of stressors through behavioural and physiological efforts, failing to which may result in reduced fitness. However, considerable variation in coping is observed. Unlike in humans, coping is often considered a personality trait in non-human animals due to construct similarity, resulting in conceptual ambiguity. Besides, limited multidisciplinary research has rendered comprehending the drivers of coping in animals challenging. We assessed repetitive behavioural coping or coping styles (n=30), emotional arousal (n=12), and consistent inter-individual differences, i.e., personalities (n=32) of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) using observations, ecologically relevant experiments, and infrared thermography. We finally investigated the association of coping with a Valine/Methionine polymorphism encoded by the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (n=26), which is widely known for its involvement in human stress regulation. Our findings suggest that personality and the presence of the human equivalent COMT Val158Met polymorphism in long-tailed macaques are associated with  emotion-focused and  problem-focused coping styles. These coping styles were consistent with emotional arousal as measured with infrared thermography. We discuss these proximate drivers of coping for a better understanding of its evolution in primates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Binding events that occur at different times is essential for memory formation. In trace fear conditioning, animals associate a tone and footshock despite no temporal overlap. The hippocampus is thought to mediate this learning by maintaining a memory of the tone until shock occurrence, however evidence for sustained hippocampal tone representations is lacking. Here we demonstrate a retrospective role for the hippocampus in trace fear conditioning. Bulk calcium imaging revealed sustained increases in CA1 activity after footshock that were not observed after tone termination. Optogenetic silencing of CA1 immediately after footshock impaired subsequent memory. Additionally, footshock increased the number of sharp wave-ripples compared to baseline during conditioning. Therefore, post-shock hippocampal activity likely supports learning by reactivating and linking latent tone and shock representations. These findings highlight an underappreciated function of post-trial hippocampal activity in enabling retroactive temporal associations during new learning, as opposed to persistent maintenance of stimulus representations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exposure to adversity during early life is linked to lasting detrimental effects on evolutionary fitness across many taxa. However, due to the challenges of collecting longitudinal data, especially in species where one sex disperses, direct evidence from long-lived species remains relatively scarce. Here we test the effects of early life adversity on male and female longevity in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We leveraged six decades of data to quantify the relative importance of ten forms of early life adversity for 6,599 macaques (3,230 male, 3,369 female), with a smaller sample size (N=299) for one form of adversity (maternal social isolation) which required high-resolution behavioral data. We found that individuals who experienced more early life adversity died earlier than those who experienced less adversity. Mortality risk was highest during early life, defined as birth to four years old, suggesting acute survival effects of adversity, but heightened mortality risk was also present in macaques who survived to adulthood. Females and males were affected differently by some forms of adversity, and these differences might be driven by varying energetic demands, female philopatry, and male dispersal. By leveraging data on thousands of macaques collected over decades, our results show that the fitness consequences of early life adversity are not uniform across individuals but vary as a function of the type of adversity, timing, and social context, and thus contribute to our limited but growing understanding of the evolution of early life sensitivities in long-lived species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There are thousands of Mendelian diseases with more being discovered weekly and the majority have no approved treatments. To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype, however the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here we show that high-throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of C. elegans disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions in their human orthologs led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggests that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With 75 known species, the freshwater fish genus Sinocyclocheilus is the largest cavefish radiation in the world, emerging as a model system for evolutionary studies. They show multiple adaptations for cave dwelling (stygomorphic adaptations), which include a range of traits such as eye degeneration (Normal-eyed, Microeyed and Eyeless), depigmentation of skin, and in some species, the presence of horns. Their behavioural adaptations to subterranean environments, however, are poorly understood. Wall-following (WF) behaviour, where an organism remains in close contact with the boundary demarcating its habitat when in the dark, is a peculiar behaviour observed in a wide range of animals and is enhanced in some cave dwellers. Hence, we hypothesize wall-following to be present also in Sinocyclocheilus, possibly enhanced in Eyeless species compared to species with visual cues (Normal / Microeyed species). Using 13 species representative of Sinocyclocheilus radiation and eye-morphs, we designed a series of assays, based on preexisting methods for Astyanax mexicanus behavioural experiments, to examine wall-following behaviour under three stimulation conditions. Our results indicate that eyeless species exhibit significantly enhanced levels of WF compared to Normal-eyed species, with Micro-eyed forms demonstrating intermediate levels. Using a mtDNA based dated phylogeny (chronogram with four clades A to D), we traced the degree of WF of these forms to outline common patterns. We show that intensity of WF behaviour is high in the subterranean clades (B &amp; C) compared to clades with free-living species (A &amp; D). Experiments on WF behaviour revealed that eyeless species are highly sensitive to vibrations, whereas normal-eyed species are the least sensitive. Since WF behaviour is present to some degree in all Sinocyclocheilus species, and given that these fishes evolved in the late Miocene, we identify this behaviour as being ancestral with WF enhancement related to cave occupation. Our results from this diversification scale study of cavefish behaviour suggest that enhanced wall-following behaviour may be a convergent trait across all stygomorphic cavefish lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Complex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated &#34;Machiavellian&#34; strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Culture in non-human animals refers to behaviour that is socially learned and persists within a population over time. Human culture is notable in that it is cumulative: new innovations have built on previous ones over thousands of years. As a result, what is acquired via social learning often goes far beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover it during their lifetime. To date, no previous study has convincingly demonstrated this phenomenon in a non-human animal. Here, we show that bumblebees can learn from a trained demonstrator to open a novel, 3D-printed two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrators to perform the unrewarded first step of the behaviour without providing a temporary reward linked to this action: the reward then being removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observers learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever having been rewarded after the first step. This suggested that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to &#39;re-innovate&#39; via individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure over the course of 12 days. The temporal and spatial distance of the unrewarded first step from the reward appeared to inhibit acquisition of two-step box-opening via individual associative learning, but this limitation was overcome by the presence of a trained conspecific. To our knowledge, these results make bumblebees the first animal to demonstrate the ability to socially learn a behaviour that is beyond their ability to innovate individually. This finding challenges the prevailing opinion of the field, which generally considers cumulative culture, which is built on this capacity, to be unique to humans.</p>
