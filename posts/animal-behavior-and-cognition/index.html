E.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562087\nDo animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an \"internal world\" to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (\u003e85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work. Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

L.; Parodi, F.; Ludwig, V.; Platt, M. L.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562362\nForaging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest--lingering too long in depleting patches--is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.\nMetamorphosis reverses the risk-taking behavioral phenotype in moor frog along a latitudinal gradient\nAuthors: Cortazar-Chinarro, M.; Corral-Lopez, A.; Ludtke, D.; Luquet, E.; Laurila, A.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562178\nUnderstanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.\nExcess neonatal testosterone causes male-specific social and fear memory deficits in wild-type mice\nAuthors: Quinones-Labernik, P.; Blocklinger, K. L.; Bruce, M. R.; Ferri, S. L.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562939\nNeurodevelopmental disorders (ND) disproportionately affect males compared to females, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in particular exhibits a 4:1 male bias. The biological mechanisms of this female protection or male susceptibility have not been identified. There is some evidence to suggest that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play pivotal roles in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the role of testosterone administration during a critical period of development, and its effects on social approach and fear learning in C57BL/6J wildtype mice. Male, but not female mice treated with testosterone on the day of birth (PN0) exhibited deficits in both social behavior and contextual fear conditioning, whereas mice treated with the same dose of testosterone on postnatal day 18 (PN18) did not display such impairments. Testosterone administration did not induce anxiogenic effects or lead to changes in weight compared to the testosterone-treated group. These impairments are relevant to ND and may help identify novel treatment targets.\nThe impact of prenatal alcohol and synthetic cannabinoid exposure on behavioral adaptations in adolescent offspring and alcohol self-administration in adulthood\nAuthors: Ornelas, L. C.; Fish, E. W.; Dooley, J. C.; Carroll, M. C.; Parnell, S. E.; Besheer, J.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561571\nPrenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol + CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.\nAcute avoidance of hydrogen sulfide is modulated by external and internal states in C. elegans\nAuthors: Pu, L.; Zhao, L.; Wang, J.; Henriksson, J.; Laurent, P.; Chen, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561535\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.\nDifferential processing of delay versus uncertainty in male but not female 16p11.2 hemideletion mice\nAuthors: Rojas, G. R.; Heller, A. T.; Grissom, N. M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560951\nNeurodevelopmental disorders are associated with differences in learning and motivation that can influence executive function, including behavioral flexibility and decision making. 16p11.2 hemideletion is a chromosomal copy number variant that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. 16p11.2 hemideletion in mice has been previously found to produce male-biased changes in reward learning, but the link between this and altered flexible decision making is poorly understood. We challenged 16p11.2 hemideletion mice with two reward-guided decision making tasks assessing flexible decision making under cost, delay and probability discounting. Both tasks elicited long-term changes in flexible decision making that separated 16p11.2 hemideletion males from wildtype males. In delay discounting,16p11.2 hemideletion males had a stronger, less flexible preference for the large reward at long delays, and this effect was reduced as wildtype males adjusted their preference to match that of the hemideletion males. In probability discounting, 16p11.2 hemideletion males initially had a similar preference for seeking improbable large rewards as did wildtype males, but over time began to prefer certainty to a greater extent than did wildtype males. Female mice discounted similarly for delayed or risky rewards regardless of the presence of the copy number variant. We have previously seen that male 16p11.2 hemideletion mice commit fewer nonreinforced responses than male wildtype mice in an operant setting, which we replicate here in delay discounting, while the introduction of risky rewards eliminates genotype differences in nonreinforced responses. Overall these data suggest that 16p11.2 hemideletion in males leads to differential processing of costs of delay versus inconsistency, with greater aversion to uncertainty than delays, and greater behavioral control by cues that consistently predict an outcome.\nLinks between behaviour and resistances to acute hyperthermia and hypoxia using rainbow trout isogenic lines\nAuthors: Lagarde, H.; LALLIAS, D.; Phocas, F.; Goardon, L.; Bideau, M.; Guyvarc'h, F.; Labbe, L.; Dupont-Nivet, M.; Cousin, X.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563047\nAcute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances are traits of growing interest in aquaculture in the context of adaptation to climate change. The feasibility of genetic improvement of these traits through selection was demonstrated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and other fish species. It is now important to understand what makes a genotype resistant by identifying the mechanisms underlying these resistances, which are still under debate. In the present study, we investigated links between resistances to acute hyperthermia and hypoxia and some behaviour variables measured in moderately stressful conditions. For this purpose, we used rainbow trout isogenic lines, previously phenotyped for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances. Behaviour of fish was phenotyped using an individual test as well as a group test, respectively response to a novel environment and evaluation of shoaling combined with response to a moderate thermal challenge. The use of isogenic lines allowed to relate resistance to acute hyperthermia with behaviour phenotypes. There were significant differences in behaviour between isogenic lines. Some behaviour variables were found to be highly correlated with acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances. Isogenic lines with a higher activity level were found to be more sensitive to acute hyperthermia and more resistant to acute hypoxia than lines with a lower activity level. This encouraging link between behaviour and resistance phenotypes also suggest that some behaviour variables could be used as predictors for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances in fish, leading to more ethical phenotyping methods than classical ones.\nDaylong Acoustic Recordings of Grazing and Rumination Activities in Dairy Cows\nAuthors: Martinez Rau, L.

L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562979\nMonitoring livestock feeding behavior may help assess animal welfare and nutritional status, and to optimize pasture management. The need for continuous and sustained monitoring requires the use of automatic techniques based on the acquisition and analysis of sensor data. This work describes an open dataset of acoustic recordings of the foraging behavior of dairy cows. The dataset includes 662 h of daily records obtained using unobtrusive and non-invasive instrumentation mounted on five lactating multiparous Holstein cows continuously monitored for six non-consecutive days in pasture and barn. Labeled recordings precisely delimiting grazing and rumination bouts are provided for a total of 400 h and for over 6,200 ingestive and rumination jaw movements. Companion information on the audio recording quality and expert-generated labels is also provided to facilitate data interpretation and analysis. This comprehensive dataset is a useful resource for studies aimed at exploring new tools and solutions for precision livestock farming.\nOvercoming Pitfalls when Estimating Variation in Parental Investment: A Simulation Study\nAuthors: Mundry, R.; Dal Pesco, F.; Aviles de Diego, A.; Fischer, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562548\n1 BackgroundIn many animal species, parents allocate resources to enhance offspring survival and thereby reproductive success ( parental investment). The level of parental investment varies between species and individuals, and one critical question in behavioral ecology and evolution is to which degree variation in parental investment affects offspring development and survival. Crucially, parental investment varies with offspring age, which creates non-trivial problems for statistical analyses, specifically when sampling is incomplete or biased. 2 MethodsWe conducted a simulation study to illustrate the problem when using average parental investment while not correcting for offspring age, and propose a modeling approach to correct for offspring age and sampling biases. We simulated a set of different scenarios, varying with regard to sample size, sampling scheme, and variation in parental investment. To model parent behavior as a function of offspring age, we fitted a Generalized Linear Mixed Model for each simulated data set. We included offspring age as a fixed effect and extracted the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) for the random intercept of parent identity. These BLUPs represent the parental investment corrected for offspring age. Finally, we assessed how our proposed modeling approach compares to the conventional approach. 3 ResultsThe proposed modeling approach was clearly superior to the conventional approach. More specifically, the conventional approach clearly overestimated the variation between parents, and even diagnosed appreciable variation when there was none in the simulated data. This bias was exacerbated by incomplete or unbalanced sampling schemes. 4 ConclusionOur simulation study clearly demonstrates the necessity of correcting for offspring age in analyses of parental investment. We strongly suggest including random slopes of offspring age within parent-offspring dyads, because doing so can reveal parent-specific trajectories of the modeled behavior against offspring age. Our approach allows for the inclusion of further categorical and continuous predictor variables that may affect parental investment, such as parity or ecological conditions. In summary, the proposed modeling approach has several advantages over conventional methods.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Do animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an &#34;internal world&#34; to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (&gt;85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work.

Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

        <p class="abstract">Foraging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest--lingering too long in depleting patches--is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) disproportionately affect males compared to females, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in particular exhibits a 4:1 male bias. The biological mechanisms of this female protection or male susceptibility have not been identified. There is some evidence to suggest that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play pivotal roles in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the role of testosterone administration during a critical period of development, and its effects on social approach and fear learning in C57BL/6J wildtype mice. Male, but not female mice treated with testosterone on the day of birth (PN0) exhibited deficits in both social behavior and contextual fear conditioning, whereas mice treated with the same dose of testosterone on postnatal day 18 (PN18) did not display such impairments. Testosterone administration did not induce anxiogenic effects or lead to changes in weight compared to the testosterone-treated group. These impairments are relevant to ND and may help identify novel treatment targets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol &#43; CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with differences in learning and motivation that can influence executive function, including behavioral flexibility and decision making. 16p11.2 hemideletion is a chromosomal copy number variant that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. 16p11.2 hemideletion in mice has been previously found to produce male-biased changes in reward learning, but the link between this and altered flexible decision making is poorly understood. We challenged 16p11.2 hemideletion mice with two reward-guided decision making tasks assessing flexible decision making under cost, delay and probability discounting. Both tasks elicited long-term changes in flexible decision making that separated 16p11.2 hemideletion males from wildtype males. In delay discounting,16p11.2 hemideletion males had a stronger, less flexible preference for the large reward at long delays, and this effect was reduced as wildtype males adjusted their preference to match that of the hemideletion males. In probability discounting, 16p11.2 hemideletion males initially had a similar preference for seeking improbable large rewards as did wildtype males, but over time began to prefer certainty to a greater extent than did wildtype males. Female mice discounted similarly for delayed or risky rewards regardless of the presence of the copy number variant. We have previously seen that male 16p11.2 hemideletion mice commit fewer nonreinforced responses than male wildtype mice in an operant setting, which we replicate here in delay discounting, while the introduction of risky rewards eliminates genotype differences in nonreinforced responses. Overall these data suggest that 16p11.2 hemideletion in males leads to differential processing of costs of delay versus inconsistency, with greater aversion to uncertainty than delays, and greater behavioral control by cues that consistently predict an outcome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances are traits of growing interest in aquaculture in the context of adaptation to climate change. The feasibility of genetic improvement of these traits through selection was demonstrated in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and other fish species. It is now important to understand what makes a genotype resistant by identifying the mechanisms underlying these resistances, which are still under debate. In the present study, we investigated links between resistances to acute hyperthermia and hypoxia and some behaviour variables measured in moderately stressful conditions. For this purpose, we used rainbow trout isogenic lines, previously phenotyped for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances. Behaviour of fish was phenotyped using an individual test as well as a group test, respectively response to a novel environment and evaluation of shoaling combined with response to a moderate thermal challenge. The use of isogenic lines allowed to relate resistance to acute hyperthermia with behaviour phenotypes. There were significant differences in behaviour between isogenic lines. Some behaviour variables were found to be highly correlated with acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances. Isogenic lines with a higher activity level were found to be more sensitive to acute hyperthermia and more resistant to acute hypoxia than lines with a lower activity level. This encouraging link between behaviour and resistance phenotypes also suggest that some behaviour variables could be used as predictors for acute hyperthermia and hypoxia resistances in fish, leading to more ethical phenotyping methods than classical ones.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Monitoring livestock feeding behavior may help assess animal welfare and nutritional status, and to optimize pasture management. The need for continuous and sustained monitoring requires the use of automatic techniques based on the acquisition and analysis of sensor data. This work describes an open dataset of acoustic recordings of the foraging behavior of dairy cows. The dataset includes 662 h of daily records obtained using unobtrusive and non-invasive instrumentation mounted on five lactating multiparous Holstein cows continuously monitored for six non-consecutive days in pasture and barn. Labeled recordings precisely delimiting grazing and rumination bouts are provided for a total of 400 h and for over 6,200 ingestive and rumination jaw movements. Companion information on the audio recording quality and expert-generated labels is also provided to facilitate data interpretation and analysis. This comprehensive dataset is a useful resource for studies aimed at exploring new tools and solutions for precision livestock farming.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1 BackgroundIn many animal species, parents allocate resources to enhance offspring survival and thereby reproductive success ( parental investment). The level of parental investment varies between species and individuals, and one critical question in behavioral ecology and evolution is to which degree variation in parental investment affects offspring development and survival. Crucially, parental investment varies with offspring age, which creates non-trivial problems for statistical analyses, specifically when sampling is incomplete or biased.

2 MethodsWe conducted a simulation study to illustrate the problem when using average parental investment while not correcting for offspring age, and propose a modeling approach to correct for offspring age and sampling biases. We simulated a set of different scenarios, varying with regard to sample size, sampling scheme, and variation in parental investment. To model parent behavior as a function of offspring age, we fitted a Generalized Linear Mixed Model for each simulated data set. We included offspring age as a fixed effect and extracted the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) for the random intercept of parent identity. These BLUPs represent the parental investment corrected for offspring age. Finally, we assessed how our proposed modeling approach compares to the conventional approach.

3 ResultsThe proposed modeling approach was clearly superior to the conventional approach. More specifically, the conventional approach clearly overestimated the variation between parents, and even diagnosed appreciable variation when there was none in the simulated data. This bias was exacerbated by incomplete or unbalanced sampling schemes.

4 ConclusionOur simulation study clearly demonstrates the necessity of correcting for offspring age in analyses of parental investment. We strongly suggest including random slopes of offspring age within parent-offspring dyads, because doing so can reveal parent-specific trajectories of the modeled behavior against offspring age. Our approach allows for the inclusion of further categorical and continuous predictor variables that may affect parental investment, such as parity or ecological conditions. In summary, the proposed modeling approach has several advantages over conventional methods.</p>
