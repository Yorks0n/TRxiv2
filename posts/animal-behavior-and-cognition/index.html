Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.\nConditioned overconsumption is dependent on reinforcer type in lean, but not obese, mice.\nAuthors: Lewis-Sanders, D.; Bullich, S.; Olvera, M. J.; Vo, J.; Hwang, Y.-S.; Stern, S. A.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573797\nAssociative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.\nHigh Resolution Outdoor Videography of Insects Using Fast Lock-On Tracking\nAuthors: Vo-Doan, T. T.; Titov, V. V.; Harrap, M. J.; Lochner, S.; Straw, A. D.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572558\nInsects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings. One-Sentence SummaryFast Lock-On tracking enables recording trajectories and high-speed videos of insects behaving over large areas in the wild.\nPose analysis in free-swimming adult zebrafish, Danio rerio:\"fishy\" origins of movement design\nAuthors: Kanwal, J. S.; Sanghera, B.; Dabbi, R.; Glasgow, E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573780\nMovement requires maneuvers that generate thrust to either make turns or move the body forward in physical space. The computational space for perpetually controlling the relative position of every point on the body surface can be vast. We hypothesize the evolution of efficient design for movement that minimizes active (neural) control by leveraging the passive (reactive) forces between the body and the surrounding medium at play. To test our hypothesis, we investigate the presence of stereotypical postures during free-swimming in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. We perform markerless tracking using DeepLabCut, a deep learning pose estimation toolkit, to track geometric relationships between body parts. To identify putative clusters of postural configurations obtained from twelve freely behaving zebrafish, we use unsupervised multivariate time-series analysis (B-SOiD machine learning software). When applied to single individuals, this method reveals a best-fit for 36 to 50 clusters in contrast 86 clusters for data pooled from all 12 animals. The centroids of each cluster obtained over 14,000 sequential frames recorded for a single fish represent an apriori classification into relatively stable \"target body posture\" and inter-pose \"transitional postures\" that lead to and away from a target pose. We use multidimensional scaling of mean parameter values for each cluster to map cluster-centroids within two dimensions of postural space. From a post-priori visual analysis, we condense neighboring postural variants into 15 superclusters or core body configurations. We develop a nomenclature specifying the anteroposterior level/s (upper, mid and lower) and degree of bending. Our results suggest that constraining bends to mainly three levels in adult zebrafish preempts the neck, fore- and hindlimb design for maneuverability in land vertebrates.\nWhales in Space: Experiencing Aquatic Animals in Their Natural Place with the Hydroambiphone\nAuthors: Crutchfield, J. P.; Dunn, D. D.; Jurgens, A. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573441\nRecording the undersea three-dimensional bioacoustic sound field in real-time promises major benefits to marine behavior studies. We describe a novel hydrophone array--the hydroambiphone (HAP)--that adapts ambisonic spatial-audio theory to sound propagation in ocean waters to realize many of these benefits through spatial localization and acoustic immersion. Deploying it to monitor the humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of southeast Alaska demonstrates that HAP recording provides a qualitatively-improved experience of their undersea behaviors; revealing, for example, new aspects of social coordination during bubble-net feeding. On the practical side, spatialized hydrophone recording greatly reduces post-field analytical and computational challenges--such as the \"cocktail party problem\" of distinguishing single sources in a complicated and crowded auditory environment--that are common to field recordings. On the scientific side, comparing the HAPs capabilities to single-hydrophone and nonspatialized recordings yields new insights into the spatial information that allows animals to thrive in complex acoustic environments. Spatialized bioacoustics markedly improves access to the humpbacks undersea acoustic environment and expands our appreciation of their rich vocal lives.\nDoes novelty influence foraging decision of a scavenger?\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Sau, S.; Das, J.; Bhadra, A.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571372\nAcquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.\nThe significance of social interactions in synchronized swarming flight in a termite\nAuthors: Mizumoto, N.; Nozaki, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573318\nIn social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this \"swarming\" behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.\nMoonlight Polarisation Pattern Guides Nocturnal Bull Ants Home\nAuthors: Freas, C. A.; Narendra, A.; Murray, T.; Cheng, K.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573574\nCelestial cues are used by many animals to orient and navigate their environment. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces a similar pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Polarised moonlights use has, until now, only been demonstrated for straight-line orientation in nocturnal dung beetles. Here we show the first evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by altering the ambient polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we present evidence that the polarised moonlight pattern is being incorporated throughout the night into these ants path integration system for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.\nDual-system free-operant avoidance: extension of a theory\nAuthors: Perez, O. D.; Dickinson, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.24.542134\nOur theory of positively reinforced free-operant behavior (Perez \u0026 Dickinson, 2020) assumes that responding is controlled by 2 systems. One system is sensitive to the correlation between response and reinforcement rates and controls goal-directed behavior, whereas a habitual system learns by reward prediction error. We present an extension of this theory to the aversive domain that explains why free-operant avoidance responding increases with both the experienced rate of negative reinforcement and the difference between this rate and that programmed by the avoidance schedule. The theory also assumes that the habitual component is reinforced by the acquisition of aversive inhibitory properties by the feedback stimuli generated by responding, which then act as safety signals that reinforce habit performance. Our analysis suggests that the distinction between habitual and goal-directed control of rewarded behavior can also be applied to the aversive domain.\nVocalization Patterns in Laying Hens - An Analysis of Stress-Induced Audio Responses\nAuthors: Neethirajan, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573338\nThis study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Associative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings.

        <p class="abstract">Movement requires maneuvers that generate thrust to either make turns or move the body forward in physical space. The computational space for perpetually controlling the relative position of every point on the body surface can be vast. We hypothesize the evolution of efficient design for movement that minimizes active (neural) control by leveraging the passive (reactive) forces between the body and the surrounding medium at play. To test our hypothesis, we investigate the presence of stereotypical postures during free-swimming in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. We perform markerless tracking using DeepLabCut, a deep learning pose estimation toolkit, to track geometric relationships between body parts. To identify putative clusters of postural configurations obtained from twelve freely behaving zebrafish, we use unsupervised multivariate time-series analysis (B-SOiD machine learning software). When applied to single individuals, this method reveals a best-fit for 36 to 50 clusters in contrast 86 clusters for data pooled from all 12 animals. The centroids of each cluster obtained over 14,000 sequential frames recorded for a single fish represent an apriori classification into relatively stable &#34;target body posture&#34; and inter-pose &#34;transitional postures&#34; that lead to and away from a target pose. We use multidimensional scaling of mean parameter values for each cluster to map cluster-centroids within two dimensions of postural space. From a post-priori visual analysis, we condense neighboring postural variants into 15 superclusters or core body configurations. We develop a nomenclature specifying the anteroposterior level/s (upper, mid and lower) and degree of bending. Our results suggest that constraining bends to mainly three levels in adult zebrafish preempts the neck, fore- and hindlimb design for maneuverability in land vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recording the undersea three-dimensional bioacoustic sound field in real-time promises major benefits to marine behavior studies. We describe a novel hydrophone array--the hydroambiphone (HAP)--that adapts ambisonic spatial-audio theory to sound propagation in ocean waters to realize many of these benefits through spatial localization and acoustic immersion. Deploying it to monitor the humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of southeast Alaska demonstrates that HAP recording provides a qualitatively-improved experience of their undersea behaviors; revealing, for example, new aspects of social coordination during bubble-net feeding. On the practical side, spatialized hydrophone recording greatly reduces post-field analytical and computational challenges--such as the &#34;cocktail party problem&#34; of distinguishing single sources in a complicated and crowded auditory environment--that are common to field recordings. On the scientific side, comparing the HAPs capabilities to single-hydrophone and nonspatialized recordings yields new insights into the spatial information that allows animals to thrive in complex acoustic environments. Spatialized bioacoustics markedly improves access to the humpbacks undersea acoustic environment and expands our appreciation of their rich vocal lives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this &#34;swarming&#34; behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Celestial cues are used by many animals to orient and navigate their environment. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces a similar pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Polarised moonlights use has, until now, only been demonstrated for straight-line orientation in nocturnal dung beetles. Here we show the first evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by altering the ambient polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we present evidence that the polarised moonlight pattern is being incorporated throughout the night into these ants path integration system for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our theory of positively reinforced free-operant behavior (Perez &amp; Dickinson, 2020) assumes that responding is controlled by 2 systems. One system is sensitive to the correlation between response and reinforcement rates and controls goal-directed behavior, whereas a habitual system learns by reward prediction error. We present an extension of this theory to the aversive domain that explains why free-operant avoidance responding increases with both the experienced rate of negative reinforcement and the difference between this rate and that programmed by the avoidance schedule. The theory also assumes that the habitual component is reinforced by the acquisition of aversive inhibitory properties by the feedback stimuli generated by responding, which then act as safety signals that reinforce habit performance. Our analysis suggests that the distinction between habitual and goal-directed control of rewarded behavior can also be applied to the aversive domain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.</p>
