Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems. One-Sentence SummaryTestard et al. show that natural disasters alter the adaptive benefits of sociality triggering persistent behavioral changes in animals.\nFawn bedsite selection by a large ungulate living in a peri-urban area\nAuthors: Conteddu, K.; Wilson, K.; Amin, B.; Chari, S.; Haigh, A.; Griffin, L. L.; Quinn, M.; Ryan, A.; Smith, A. F.; Ciuti, S.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552922\nHuman populations continue to grow at an unprecedented rate, along with the associated anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, exploring wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and informing wildlife management decisions. Here, we explored how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns responded to human and dog presence during the birthing period in the largest walled urban park in Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) space use, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least [~]200m. Bedsites were also unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Additionally, fallow deer mothers were found to select for dense understory vegetation for bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal their offspring. Our results provide detailed insights into how female fallow deer adapt their spatial and habitat selection for bedsites during the fawning season in response to human activities, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites in order to alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.\nMany morphs: parsing gesture signals from the noise\nAuthors: Mielke, A.; Badihi, G.; Graham, K.

E.; Stewart, F.; Wilke, C.; Zuberbühler, K.; Hobaiter, C.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.551967\nParsing signals from noise is a general problem for signallers and recipients, as well as for researchers studying communicative systems. Substantial research efforts have been invested in comparing how other species encode information and meaning in their signals, and how signalling is structured. However, our ability to do so depends on identifying and discriminating signals that represent meaningful units of analysis. Early approaches to defining signal repertoires applied top- down approaches, classifying cases into predefined signal types. Recently, more labour-intensive methods have taken a bottom-up approach describing the features of each signal in detail and clustering cases into types based on patterns of similarity between them in multi-dimensional feature-space that were previously undetectable. Nevertheless, it remains essential to assess whether the resulting repertoires are composed of relevant units from the perspective of the species using them, and redefining repertoires when additional data makes more detailed analyses feasible. In this paper we provide a framework that takes data from the largest set of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) gestures currently available, splitting gesture types at a fine scale based on modifying features of gesture expression and then determining whether this splitting process increases the information content of the communication system. Our method allows different features of interest to be incorporated into the splitting process, providing substantial future flexibility across - for example - species, populations, and levels of signal granularity. In doing so we provide a powerful tool allowing researchers interested in gestural communication to establish repertoires of relevant units for subsequent analyses within and between systems of communication.\nCase report on lethal dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an anthropogenic landscape\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Pithva, K.; Mohanty, S.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553455\nFor nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primate, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.\n(De)composing sociality: disentangling individual-specific from dyad-specific propensities to interact\nAuthors: Neumann, C.; Fischer, J.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.549768\nO_LIIn socially living animals, relationships between group members are typically highly differentiated. Some dyads maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak ties. There is growing evidence that the number and strength of social bonds are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals are driven by two different processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of the individuals involved and their dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to inter-act specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness. C_LIO_LIWe present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We provide the R package bamoso, which builds on Stan code to implement models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes. C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the application and some of the critical advantages of our proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level sociality and individual-level outcomes in a unified model. C_LIO_LIOur model will help to understand how and why individuals interact with each other and will help address questions about the relationship between variation in sociality and other features of interest, both within and across species.

S.; Jackson, M.; Zamansky, A.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.552730\nThe emerging field of canine cognitive neuroscience uses neuroimaging tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cognitive processes of dogs to neural substrates in their brain. Within the past decade, the non-invasive use of EEG has provided real-time, accessible, and portable neuroimaging insight into canine cognitive processes. To promote systematization and create an overview of framings, methods and findings for future work, we provide a systematic review of non-invasive canine EEG studies (N=22), dissecting their study makeup, technical setup, and analysis frameworks and highlighting emerging trends. We further propose new directions of development, such as the standardization of data structures and integrating predictive modeling with descriptive statistical approaches. Our review ends by underscoring the advances and advantages of EEG-based canine cognitive neuroscience and the potential for accessible canine neuroimaging to inform both fundamental sciences as well as practical applications for cognitive neuroscience, working dogs, and human-canine interactions.\nNutritional insensitivity to mating in male fruit flies\nAuthors: Sydney, M. C.; Chapman, T.; Perry, J. C.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552938\nAnimals can adjust their consumption of different nutrients to adaptively match their current or expected physiological state. Changes in diet preference can arise from social and sexual experience. For example, in female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, a single mating triggers a behavioural switch in diet choice towards increased protein intake and total food consumption, which supports offspring production. In contrast, male diet choice appears to be unaffected by a single mating. However, one mating may not fully capture the impact of mating on male feeding behaviour. Males can often mate multiply in natural settings, and the costs of ejaculate production and energetic courtship may be cumulative, such that males might experience increased nutritional demands only after multiple matings. In this study we tested this idea by measuring the effect of multiple matings on the diet choice of male D. melanogaster fruit flies. Males were assigned to one of three mating treatments - unmated, mated once or mated five times consecutively - and then allowed to feed freely on chemically-defined diets of protein and carbohydrate. In contrast to the prediction, we found that males that mated five times did not alter the amount of food, nor the proportion of protein and carbohydrate consumed, when compared with unmated or once-mated males. This absence of a feeding response occurred despite substantial ejaculate depletion from multiple matings: males sired fewer offspring in each consecutive mating. These results reveal a lack of plasticity in male feeding behaviour according to mating status, despite substantial potential physiological costs, and highlight the remarkably distinct nutritional ecologies of males versus females.\nCrowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling reveal parrot tool use is not rare\nAuthors: Bastos, A. P.; Claessens, S.; Nelson, X. J.; Welch, D.; Atkinson, Q. D.; Taylor, A. H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553302\nStudying the prevalence of putatively rare behaviours, such as tool use, is challenging because absence of evidence can arise either from a species inability to produce the behaviour or from insufficient research effort. Here, we tackle this challenge by combining crowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling to approximate actual rates of a rarely observed behaviour based on limited data, targeting tool use in parrots. Crowdsourcing on a social media platform revealed novel instances of tool use in 17 parrot species, more than doubling the confirmed number of tool-using parrot species from 11 (3%) to 28 (7%). Phylogenetic modelling ranked additional species that are most likely to be unobserved tool users, suggesting that between 11% and 17% of extant parrot species may be tool users. These discoveries have implications for inferences about the evolutionary drivers and origins of tool use in parrots, revealing associations with relative brain size and feeding generalism and indicating several genera where tool use was likely an ancestral trait. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that current sampling effort captures the full distribution of putatively rare animal behaviours. Combining our sampling and analysis methods offers a fruitful approach for investigating the distribution, drivers, and origins of other rare behaviours. This working paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.\nBunDLe-Net: Neuronal Manifold Learning Meets Behaviour\nAuthors: Kumar, A.; Gilra, A.; Gonzalez-Soto, M.; Grosse-Wentrup, M.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.551978\nNeuronal manifold learning techniques represent high-dimensional neuronal dynamics in low-dimensional embeddings to reveal the intrinsic structure of neuronal manifolds. Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BundDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BundDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BundDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BundDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

        <p class="abstract">Global warming intensifies weather-related disasters that radically alter ecosystems. How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems.

        <p class="abstract">Human populations continue to grow at an unprecedented rate, along with the associated anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, exploring wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and informing wildlife management decisions. Here, we explored how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns responded to human and dog presence during the birthing period in the largest walled urban park in Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) space use, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least [~]200m. Bedsites were also unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Additionally, fallow deer mothers were found to select for dense understory vegetation for bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal their offspring. Our results provide detailed insights into how female fallow deer adapt their spatial and habitat selection for bedsites during the fawning season in response to human activities, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites in order to alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Parsing signals from noise is a general problem for signallers and recipients, as well as for researchers studying communicative systems. Substantial research efforts have been invested in comparing how other species encode information and meaning in their signals, and how signalling is structured. However, our ability to do so depends on identifying and discriminating signals that represent meaningful units of analysis. Early approaches to defining signal repertoires applied top- down approaches, classifying cases into predefined signal types. Recently, more labour-intensive methods have taken a bottom-up approach describing the features of each signal in detail and clustering cases into types based on patterns of similarity between them in multi-dimensional feature-space that were previously undetectable. Nevertheless, it remains essential to assess whether the resulting repertoires are composed of relevant units from the perspective of the species using them, and redefining repertoires when additional data makes more detailed analyses feasible. In this paper we provide a framework that takes data from the largest set of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) gestures currently available, splitting gesture types at a fine scale based on modifying features of gesture expression and then determining whether this splitting process increases the information content of the communication system. Our method allows different features of interest to be incorporated into the splitting process, providing substantial future flexibility across - for example - species, populations, and levels of signal granularity. In doing so we provide a powerful tool allowing researchers interested in gestural communication to establish repertoires of relevant units for subsequent analyses within and between systems of communication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primate, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIn socially living animals, relationships between group members are typically highly differentiated. Some dyads maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak ties. There is growing evidence that the number and strength of social bonds are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals are driven by two different processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of the individuals involved and their dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to inter-act specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness.
C_LIO_LIWe present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We provide the R package bamoso, which builds on Stan code to implement models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the application and some of the critical advantages of our proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level sociality and individual-level outcomes in a unified model.
C_LIO_LIOur model will help to understand how and why individuals interact with each other and will help address questions about the relationship between variation in sociality and other features of interest, both within and across species.

        <p class="abstract">The emerging field of canine cognitive neuroscience uses neuroimaging tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cognitive processes of dogs to neural substrates in their brain. Within the past decade, the non-invasive use of EEG has provided real-time, accessible, and portable neuroimaging insight into canine cognitive processes. To promote systematization and create an overview of framings, methods and findings for future work, we provide a systematic review of non-invasive canine EEG studies (N=22), dissecting their study makeup, technical setup, and analysis frameworks and highlighting emerging trends. We further propose new directions of development, such as the standardization of data structures and integrating predictive modeling with descriptive statistical approaches. Our review ends by underscoring the advances and advantages of EEG-based canine cognitive neuroscience and the potential for accessible canine neuroimaging to inform both fundamental sciences as well as practical applications for cognitive neuroscience, working dogs, and human-canine interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals can adjust their consumption of different nutrients to adaptively match their current or expected physiological state. Changes in diet preference can arise from social and sexual experience. For example, in female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, a single mating triggers a behavioural switch in diet choice towards increased protein intake and total food consumption, which supports offspring production. In contrast, male diet choice appears to be unaffected by a single mating. However, one mating may not fully capture the impact of mating on male feeding behaviour. Males can often mate multiply in natural settings, and the costs of ejaculate production and energetic courtship may be cumulative, such that males might experience increased nutritional demands only after multiple matings. In this study we tested this idea by measuring the effect of multiple matings on the diet choice of male D. melanogaster fruit flies. Males were assigned to one of three mating treatments - unmated, mated once or mated five times consecutively - and then allowed to feed freely on chemically-defined diets of protein and carbohydrate. In contrast to the prediction, we found that males that mated five times did not alter the amount of food, nor the proportion of protein and carbohydrate consumed, when compared with unmated or once-mated males. This absence of a feeding response occurred despite substantial ejaculate depletion from multiple matings: males sired fewer offspring in each consecutive mating. These results reveal a lack of plasticity in male feeding behaviour according to mating status, despite substantial potential physiological costs, and highlight the remarkably distinct nutritional ecologies of males versus females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studying the prevalence of putatively rare behaviours, such as tool use, is challenging because absence of evidence can arise either from a species inability to produce the behaviour or from insufficient research effort. Here, we tackle this challenge by combining crowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling to approximate actual rates of a rarely observed behaviour based on limited data, targeting tool use in parrots. Crowdsourcing on a social media platform revealed novel instances of tool use in 17 parrot species, more than doubling the confirmed number of tool-using parrot species from 11 (3%) to 28 (7%). Phylogenetic modelling ranked additional species that are most likely to be unobserved tool users, suggesting that between 11% and 17% of extant parrot species may be tool users. These discoveries have implications for inferences about the evolutionary drivers and origins of tool use in parrots, revealing associations with relative brain size and feeding generalism and indicating several genera where tool use was likely an ancestral trait. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that current sampling effort captures the full distribution of putatively rare animal behaviours. Combining our sampling and analysis methods offers a fruitful approach for investigating the distribution, drivers, and origins of other rare behaviours.

Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BundDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BundDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BundDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BundDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.</p>
