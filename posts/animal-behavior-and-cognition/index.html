Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.\nGlucose intolerance induces anxiety-like behaviors independent of obesity and insulin resistance in a novel model of nutritional metabolic stress\nAuthors: Al-Onaizi, M.; Braysh, K.; Alkefeef, S.; Altarrah, D.; Dannoon, S.; Alasousi, D.; Adel, H.; Al-Ajmi, M.; Kandari, A.; Najem, R.; Nizam, R.; Williams, M. R.; John, S.; Thanaraj, T. A.; Ahmad, R.; Al-Hussaini, H.; Al-Mulla, F.; Alzaid, F.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-08-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553760\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) and its comorbidities are a major public health concern. In addition to peripheral tissues, T2D also impacts the central nervous system leading to neurocognitive impairments, including memory deficits, anxiety, and depression. The metabolic determinants of these neurocognitive impairments remain unidentified. Here, we used a novel proprietary high-fat diet, in which glucose intolerance precedes weight gain, to decipher the metabolic determinants of neurocognitive affects. We show that this model exhibits anxiety-like behaviors, without eliciting depression nor recognition memory deficits. Long-term feeding leads to weight gain, brain glucose hypometabolism and impaired recognition memory alongside the early onset anxiety-like behavior. Using an established genetic model of T2D (db/db) and of diet-induced obesity we show that additional insulin resistance and obesity are associated with depressive-like behaviors and recognition memory deficits. Our findings indicate that glucose intolerance alone can elicit anxiety-like behaviors. Through this study we also provide a novel nutritional model to characterize the discrete effects of glucose intolerance on cognition, behavior, and the physiology of metabolic disease.\nAn Integrated Platform for in vivo Electrophysiology in Spatial Cognition Experiments\nAuthors: Brea Guerrero, A.; Oijala, M.; Moseley, S. C.; Tang, T.; Fletcher, F.; Zheng, Y.; Sanchez, L. M.; Clark, B.; Mcnaughton, B.; Wilber, A. A.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551691\nSpatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available. Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform, Maze and Stim Trigger. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. Stim Trigger permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers. Significance StatementThis paper presents an innovative and cost-effective behavioral platform designed to distinguish between different navigational elements, addressing the crucial need for better spatial cognition research paradigms. The platforms flexibility allows for quick modifications without major software or hardware changes. Additionally, the freely available software, comprising Maze and Stim Trigger components, enables precise time stamping of neural events with behavior, while facilitating automatic reward delivery and brain stimulation control. Beyond spatial cognition assessment, the platforms adaptability extends to non-spatial behavioral testing. By openly sharing this software, the authors aim to foster collaboration and encourage future developments, promoting its application to a broader community of researchers. This platform represents a significant advancement in spatial cognition research and behavioral experimentation methods.\nCognitive limits of larval Drosophila: Testing for conditioned inhibition, sensory preconditioning and second-order conditioning\nAuthors: Sen, E.; El-Keredy, A.; Jacob, N.; Mancini, N.; Asnaz, G.; Widmann, A.; Gerber, B.; Thoener, J.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554112\nDrosophila larvae are an established model system for studying the mechanisms of innate and simple forms of learned behaviour. They have about 10 times fewer neurons than adult flies, and it was the low total number of their neurons that allowed for an electron microscopic reconstruction of their brain at synaptic resolution. Regarding the mushroom body, a central brain structure for associative learning in insects, it turned out that more than half of the classes of synaptic connection had previously escaped attention. Understanding the function of these circuit motifs, subsequently confirmed in adult flies, is an important current research topic. In this context, we test larval Drosophila for their cognitive abilities in three tasks that are characteristically more complex than those previously studied. Our data provide evidence for (i) conditioned inhibition, as has previously been reported for adult flies and honeybees. Unlike what is described for adult flies and honeybees, however, our data do not provide evidence for (ii) sensory preconditioning or (iii) second-order conditioning in Drosophila larvae. We discuss methodological features of our experiments as well as four specific aspects of the organisation of the larval brain that may explain why these two forms of learning are observed in honeybees and adult flies, but not in larval Drosophila.\nCase report on lethal dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in an anthropogenic landscape\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Pithva, K.; Mohanty, S.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553455\nFor nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.\nHearing loss in juvenile rats leads to excessive play fighting and hyperactivity, mild cognitive deficits and altered neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex\nAuthors: Jelinek, J.; Johne, M.; Alam, M.; Krauss, J. K.; Kral, A.; Schwabe, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554422\nBackground: In children, hearing loss has been associated with hyperactivity, disturbed social interaction, and risk of cognitive disturbances. Mechanistic explanations of these relations sometimes involve language. To investigate the effect of hearing loss on behavioral deficits in the absence of language, we tested the impact of hearing loss in juvenile rats on motor, social, and cognitive behavior and on physiology of prefrontal cortex. Methods: Hearing loss was induced in juvenile (postnatal day 14) male Sprague-Dawley rats by intracochlear injection of neomycin under general anaesthesia. Sham-operated and non-operated hearing rats served as controls. One week after surgery auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements verified hearing loss or intact hearing in sham-operated and non-operated controls. All rats were then tested for locomotor activity (open field), coordination (Rotarod), and for social interaction during development in weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after surgery. From week 8 on, rats were trained and tested for spatial learning and memory (4-arm baited 8-arm radial maze test). In a final setting, neuronal activity was recorded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Results: In the open field deafened rats moved faster and covered more distance than sham-operated and non-operated controls from week 8 on (both p\u003c0.05). Deafened rats showed significantly more play fighting during development (p\u003c0.05), whereas other aspects of social interaction, such as following, were not affected. Learning of the radial maze test was not impaired in deafened rats (p\u003e0.05), but rats used less next-arm entries than other groups indicating impaired concept learning (p\u003c0.05). In the mPFC neuronal firing rate was reduced and enhanced irregular firing was observed. Moreover, oscillatory activity was altered, both within the mPFC and in coherence of mPFC with the somatosensory cortex (p\u003c0.05). Conclusions: Hearing loss in juvenile rats leads to hyperactive behavior and pronounced play-fighting during development, suggesting a causal relationship between hearing loss and cognitive development. Altered neuronal activities in the mPFC after hearing loss support such effects on neuronal networks outside the central auditory system. This animal model provides evidence of developmental consequences of juvenile hearing loss on prefrontal cortex in absence of language as potential confounding factor.\nOctopus arm search strategies over complex surfaces\nAuthors: Sivitilli, D. M.; Zulch, A.; Gire, D. H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551380\nDespite the extreme flexibility of the octopuss arms and their resulting near infinite possible configurations, the octopus effectively controls its arms during a wide variety of behaviors, including locomotion, foraging, excavation, exploration, and manipulation. If appropriately characterized, the octopuss biomechanical properties and control strategies could be implemented in the development of a soft robotic limb with the same range of capabilities. When operating without visual feedback, the octopus must rely on the complex chemotactile sensory system within its suckers, and in these conditions sucker recruitment plays a prominent role in search behavior, causing the arm to conform to surface features in the environment. However, how this mechanism is used to search over the complex and convoluted surfaces in the octopuss natural habitat is unknown. Here, we investigate the strategies the octopus uses to search for a reward hidden among a row of multiple small openings of a task space, and how it uses multiple arms to search three parallel versions of this task space. We found that when the arm encounters multiple openings in a surface, it performs a distal to proximal search pattern, starting with the farthest openings within reach then working its way proximally with a preference for searching each opening in succession. This strategy would allow the octopus to use its highly flexible limbs to perform an exhaustive search pattern over complex surfaces.\nChemokine receptor 5 signaling in PFC mediates stress susceptibility in female mice\nAuthors: Lin, H.-Y.; Cathomas, F.; Li, L.; Cuttoli, R.

W.; Zhang, B.; Russo, S.; Wang, J.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553789\nChronic stress induces changes in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) that contribute to neuropathology and behavioral abnormalities associated with psychiatric disorders. In this study, we examined the impact of peripheral and central inflammation during chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in female mice. Compared to male mice, we found that female mice exhibited heightened peripheral inflammatory response and identified C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), as a stress-susceptibility marker in females. Blocking CCL5 signaling in the periphery promoted resilience to CSDS. In the brain, stress-susceptible mice displayed increased expression of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a receptor for CCL5, in microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This upregulation was associated with microglia morphological changes, their increased migration to the blood vessels, and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic components and vascular material. These changes coincided with neurophysiological alterations and impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. By blocking CCR5 signaling specifically in the PFC were able to prevent stress-induced physiological changes and rescue social avoidance behavior. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that stress-mediated dysregulation of the CCL5-CCR5 axis triggers excessive phagocytosis of synaptic materials and neurovascular components by microglia, resulting in disruptions in neurotransmission, reduced BBB integrity, and increased stress susceptibility. Our study provides new insights into the role of cortical microglia in female stress susceptibility and suggests that the CCL5-CCR5 axis may serve as a novel sex-specific therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders in females.\nCholinergic interneurons in the dorsal striatum play an important role in the acquisition of duration memory\nAuthors: Nishioka, M.; Hata, T.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553866\nAlthough the formation of duration memory is important to optimize the timing of behavior based on previous experiences, the neural mechanism of formation remains unclear. A previous study suggested that muscarinic acetylcholine 1 receptors (M1Rs) in the dorsal striatum of rats are involved in the consolidation of duration memory in interval timing. Therefore, cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) may also be involved in the formation of duration memory in interval timing because ChIs activate M1Rs in the dorsal striatum. In the Exp. 1A, rats underwent a peak interval (PI)-20 s training. During the training, two different trials were randomly presented. One was a food trial in which the initial lever press was reinforced 20 s after the start of the trial (i.e., fixed interval (FI), 20 s). The other was an empty trial in which the reinforcement did not occur for 80 s. After sufficient training, the rats responded at approximately 20 s in the empty trials. They were then subjected to a PI-40 s training (i.e., FI, 40 s) after ChI lesions were present in the dorsal striatum. In this training, the sham-lesioned group responded frequently at approximately 40 s, whereas the ChI-lesioned group responded at approximately 20 s. As the PI-40 s additional learning progressed in the Exp. 1B, the ChI-lesioned group frequently responded at approximately 40 s, similar to that of the sham-lesioned group. In the following PI-20 s re-shift training, the ChI-lesioned group responded similar to the sham-lesioned group. In Exp. 2 of another cohort, the results of a PI-20 s training after the occurrence of ChI lesions were similar to that before the presence of the lesion. Together, these results suggest that ChI lesions delayed only the acquisition of new duration memory, but had no effect on the adjustment of behavior associated with changing the reinforcement schedule of the PI-training and interval timing itself.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek self-stimulation on a carousel.

        <p class="abstract">Complex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated &#34;Machiavellian&#34; strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its comorbidities are a major public health concern. In addition to peripheral tissues, T2D also impacts the central nervous system leading to neurocognitive impairments, including memory deficits, anxiety, and depression. The metabolic determinants of these neurocognitive impairments remain unidentified. Here, we used a novel proprietary high-fat diet, in which glucose intolerance precedes weight gain, to decipher the metabolic determinants of neurocognitive affects. We show that this model exhibits anxiety-like behaviors, without eliciting depression nor recognition memory deficits. Long-term feeding leads to weight gain, brain glucose hypometabolism and impaired recognition memory alongside the early onset anxiety-like behavior. Using an established genetic model of T2D (db/db) and of diet-induced obesity we show that additional insulin resistance and obesity are associated with depressive-like behaviors and recognition memory deficits. Our findings indicate that glucose intolerance alone can elicit anxiety-like behaviors. Through this study we also provide a novel nutritional model to characterize the discrete effects of glucose intolerance on cognition, behavior, and the physiology of metabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available.

Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform,  Maze and  Stim Trigger. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. Stim Trigger permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers.

Significance StatementThis paper presents an innovative and cost-effective behavioral platform designed to distinguish between different navigational elements, addressing the crucial need for better spatial cognition research paradigms. The platforms flexibility allows for quick modifications without major software or hardware changes. Additionally, the freely available software, comprising  Maze and  Stim Trigger components, enables precise time stamping of neural events with behavior, while facilitating automatic reward delivery and brain stimulation control. Beyond spatial cognition assessment, the platforms adaptability extends to non-spatial behavioral testing. By openly sharing this software, the authors aim to foster collaboration and encourage future developments, promoting its application to a broader community of researchers. This platform represents a significant advancement in spatial cognition research and behavioral experimentation methods.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Drosophila larvae are an established model system for studying the mechanisms of innate and simple forms of learned behaviour. They have about 10 times fewer neurons than adult flies, and it was the low total number of their neurons that allowed for an electron microscopic reconstruction of their brain at synaptic resolution. Regarding the mushroom body, a central brain structure for associative learning in insects, it turned out that more than half of the classes of synaptic connection had previously escaped attention. Understanding the function of these circuit motifs, subsequently confirmed in adult flies, is an important current research topic. In this context, we test larval Drosophila for their cognitive abilities in three tasks that are characteristically more complex than those previously studied. Our data provide evidence for (i) conditioned inhibition, as has previously been reported for adult flies and honeybees. Unlike what is described for adult flies and honeybees, however, our data do not provide evidence for (ii) sensory preconditioning or (iii) second-order conditioning in Drosophila larvae. We discuss methodological features of our experiments as well as four specific aspects of the organisation of the larval brain that may explain why these two forms of learning are observed in honeybees and adult flies, but not in larval Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: In children, hearing loss has been associated with hyperactivity, disturbed social interaction, and risk of cognitive disturbances. Mechanistic explanations of these relations sometimes involve language. To investigate the effect of hearing loss on behavioral deficits in the absence of language, we tested the impact of hearing loss in juvenile rats on motor, social, and cognitive behavior and on physiology of prefrontal cortex. Methods: Hearing loss was induced in juvenile (postnatal day 14) male Sprague-Dawley rats by intracochlear injection of neomycin under general anaesthesia. Sham-operated and non-operated hearing rats served as controls. One week after surgery auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements verified hearing loss or intact hearing in sham-operated and non-operated controls. All rats were then tested for locomotor activity (open field), coordination (Rotarod), and for social interaction during development in weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after surgery. From week 8 on, rats were trained and tested for spatial learning and memory (4-arm baited 8-arm radial maze test). In a final setting, neuronal activity was recorded in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Results: In the open field deafened rats moved faster and covered more distance than sham-operated and non-operated controls from week 8 on (both p&lt;0.05). Deafened rats showed significantly more play fighting during development (p&lt;0.05), whereas other aspects of social interaction, such as following, were not affected. Learning of the radial maze test was not impaired in deafened rats (p&gt;0.05), but rats used less next-arm entries than other groups indicating impaired concept learning (p&lt;0.05). In the mPFC neuronal firing rate was reduced and enhanced irregular firing was observed. Moreover, oscillatory activity was altered, both within the mPFC and in coherence of mPFC with the somatosensory cortex (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Hearing loss in juvenile rats leads to hyperactive behavior and pronounced play-fighting during development, suggesting a causal relationship between hearing loss and cognitive development. Altered neuronal activities in the mPFC after hearing loss support such effects on neuronal networks outside the central auditory system. This animal model provides evidence of developmental consequences of juvenile hearing loss on prefrontal cortex in absence of language as potential confounding factor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the extreme flexibility of the octopuss arms and their resulting near infinite possible configurations, the octopus effectively controls its arms during a wide variety of behaviors, including locomotion, foraging, excavation, exploration, and manipulation. If appropriately characterized, the octopuss biomechanical properties and control strategies could be implemented in the development of a soft robotic limb with the same range of capabilities. When operating without visual feedback, the octopus must rely on the complex chemotactile sensory system within its suckers, and in these conditions sucker recruitment plays a prominent role in search behavior, causing the arm to conform to surface features in the environment. However, how this mechanism is used to search over the complex and convoluted surfaces in the octopuss natural habitat is unknown. Here, we investigate the strategies the octopus uses to search for a reward hidden among a row of multiple small openings of a task space, and how it uses multiple arms to search three parallel versions of this task space. We found that when the arm encounters multiple openings in a surface, it performs a distal to proximal search pattern, starting with the farthest openings within reach then working its way proximally with a preference for searching each opening in succession. This strategy would allow the octopus to use its highly flexible limbs to perform an exhaustive search pattern over complex surfaces.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic stress induces changes in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) that contribute to neuropathology and behavioral abnormalities associated with psychiatric disorders. In this study, we examined the impact of peripheral and central inflammation during chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in female mice. Compared to male mice, we found that female mice exhibited heightened peripheral inflammatory response and identified C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), as a stress-susceptibility marker in females. Blocking CCL5 signaling in the periphery promoted resilience to CSDS. In the brain, stress-susceptible mice displayed increased expression of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a receptor for CCL5, in microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This upregulation was associated with microglia morphological changes, their increased migration to the blood vessels, and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic components and vascular material. These changes coincided with neurophysiological alterations and impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. By blocking CCR5 signaling specifically in the PFC were able to prevent stress-induced physiological changes and rescue social avoidance behavior. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that stress-mediated dysregulation of the CCL5-CCR5 axis triggers excessive phagocytosis of synaptic materials and neurovascular components by microglia, resulting in disruptions in neurotransmission, reduced BBB integrity, and increased stress susceptibility. Our study provides new insights into the role of cortical microglia in female stress susceptibility and suggests that the CCL5-CCR5 axis may serve as a novel sex-specific therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders in females.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although the formation of duration memory is important to optimize the timing of behavior based on previous experiences, the neural mechanism of formation remains unclear. A previous study suggested that muscarinic acetylcholine 1 receptors (M1Rs) in the dorsal striatum of rats are involved in the consolidation of duration memory in interval timing. Therefore, cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) may also be involved in the formation of duration memory in interval timing because ChIs activate M1Rs in the dorsal striatum. In the Exp. 1A, rats underwent a peak interval (PI)-20 s training. During the training, two different trials were randomly presented. One was a food trial in which the initial lever press was reinforced 20 s after the start of the trial (i.e., fixed interval (FI), 20 s). The other was an empty trial in which the reinforcement did not occur for 80 s. After sufficient training, the rats responded at approximately 20 s in the empty trials. They were then subjected to a PI-40 s training (i.e., FI, 40 s) after ChI lesions were present in the dorsal striatum. In this training, the sham-lesioned group responded frequently at approximately 40 s, whereas the ChI-lesioned group responded at approximately 20 s. As the PI-40 s additional learning progressed in the Exp. 1B, the ChI-lesioned group frequently responded at approximately 40 s, similar to that of the sham-lesioned group. In the following PI-20 s re-shift training, the ChI-lesioned group responded similar to the sham-lesioned group. In Exp. 2 of another cohort, the results of a PI-20 s training after the occurrence of ChI lesions were similar to that before the presence of the lesion. Together, these results suggest that ChI lesions delayed only the acquisition of new duration memory, but had no effect on the adjustment of behavior associated with changing the reinforcement schedule of the PI-training and interval timing itself.</p>
