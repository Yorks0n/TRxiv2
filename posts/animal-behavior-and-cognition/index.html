C.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452\nSocial learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors---such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure---on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but has rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from \u003e400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.\nIndividual recognition in a jumping spider (Phidippus regius)\nAuthors: Dahl, C. D.; Cheng, Y.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567545\nIndividual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.\nIndividuality across environmental context in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Mathejczyk, T.; Knief, C.; Haidar, M. A.; Freitag, F.; McClary, T.; Wernet, M. F.; Linneweber, G. A.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568741\nOver the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain stable over long time periods. The stability of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animals individuality, or personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The ongoing person-situation debate in humans and observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether animal behavior also remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The stability of three individual traits (exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, stability of behavior always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. In summary, our work demonstrates that similar to humans, animal individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments.\nPrimate origins of human event cognition\nAuthors: Wilson, V. A. D.; Sauppe, S.; Brocard, S.; Ringen, E. J.; Daum, M. M.; Wermelinger, S.; Gu, N.; Andrews, C.; Isasi-Isasmendi, A.; Bickel, B.; Zuberbuehler, K.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568086\nHuman language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available. Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.\nExperience reduces reliance on conspecifics for route selection by a collectively migrating soaring bird\nAuthors: Bronnvik, H.; Nourani, E.; Fiedler, W.; Flack, A.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567993\nMigration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.\nFlight behaviour diverges more between seasonal forms than between species in Pieris butterflies\nAuthors: Kleckova, I.; Linke, D.; Rezende, F.; Rauscher, L.; Le Roy, C.; Matos, P.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568806\nIn flying animals, wing morphology jointly evolves with flight behaviours. Whether seasonal polymorphism in butterfly wing morphology is linked to divergent flight behaviour is however not known. Here we compared the flight behaviour and the morphology between the spring and the summer forms of two closely related, temperate species, Pieris napi and P. rapae. We first quantify three-dimensional flight behaviour by reconstructing individual flight trajectories using stereoscopic high-speed videography in an experimental cage. We then measure wing size and shape characteristics assumed to influence flight behaviours in butterflies. We show that seasonal, but not interspecific, differences in flight behaviour might be associated with divergent forewing shapes, either elongated or rounded wings. In Pieris spring forms, individuals are small and have elongated forewings, which are significantly correlated with low speed and acceleration, but with high flight curvature. Large Pieris summer individuals exhibit rounded forewings, which are correlated with high flight speed, turning acceleration, and advance ratio. We interpret such results as potentially adaptive flight behaviours in Pieris. Curvy flight trajectories in the spring forms may be a specialised foraging behaviour evolving in response to newly emerging feeding and oviposition resources. In contrast, the summer forms high flight speed and flight efficiency may be advantageous for dispersal to new habitats. Further, the recorded higher acceleration capacities of the summer form could have evolved in response to higher predation pressure. Our study provides quantitative evidence of divergent flight behaviours between seasonal forms of Pieris butterflies correlated with differences in wing morphology. Seasonal flight behaviour could be adaptive, possibly driven by the interaction of various seasonal selection pressures, including resource distribution (nectar and larval food plants), predator and parasitoid pressure, and thermoregulation.\nGeographic variation in the songs of two closely related song-learning species, Anna's and Costa's hummingbird (Calypte anna, C. costae)\nAuthors: Berger, A.; Ye, W.; Padilla, A.; Gumbi, B.; Clark, C.; Campbell, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568754\nIn species that learn their song, cultural transmission of song components can lead to the accumulation of variants that differ among populations, resulting in the formation of dialects. Three avian clades are thought to have independently evolved song learning - parrots, oscine passerines, and hummingbirds. Dialects have mainly been studied in passerines. We extend the study of dialects to the bee hummingbird clade, focusing on Annas and Costas hummingbirds (Calypte anna and C. costae). Both species are vocal learners. Annas produces complex, three phrase, multi-syllable songs and Costas produces simple, one phrase songs. We recorded 5-24 males per population (5 Costas and 6 Annas populations) across the species ranges in the Western United States and tested for evidence of geographic variation in song. We found minor population differences in frequency measures of Costas song, but song form was invariant across populations. Annas song was contrastingly variable with population differences in both syllable use and multiple spectral and temporal measures. The most strongly differentiated Annas population in our study, Seattle (Washington State), is the product of a recent northward range expansion facilitated by human activities that provide additional food sources for hummingbirds. The loss and modification of syllables in this population is suggestive of a founder effect on song. This study provides insight into song evolution in non-passerine vocal learners and contributes to understanding of how complex signals evolve.\nNatural variability and individuality of walking behavior in Drosophila\nAuthors: Godesberg, V.; Bockemühl, T.; Büschges, A.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567019\nInsects use walking behavior in a large number of contexts, such as exploration, foraging, escape and pursuit, or migration. A lot is known on how nervous systems produce this behavior in general and also how certain parameters vary with regard to walking direction or speed, for instance. An aspect that has not received much attention is if and how walking behavior varies across individuals of a particular species. To address this, we created a large corpus of kinematic walking data of many individuals of the fruit fly Drosophila. We only selected instances of straight walking in a narrow range of walking speeds to minimize the influence of these high-level parameters, aiming to uncover more subtle aspects of variability. Using high-speed videography and automated annotation we captured the positions of the six leg tips for thousands of steps and used principal components analysis to characterize the postural space individuals used during walking. Our analysis shows that the largest part of walking kinematics can be described by five principal components (PCs). Separation of these five PCs into a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional subspace was found to divide the description of walking behavior into invariant features shared across individuals and features that relate to the specifics of individuals; the latter features can be regarded as idiosyncrasies. We also demonstrate that this approach can detect the effects of experimental interventions in an unbiased manner and that general aspects of individuality, such as the average width of the individual walking posture, can be described. Summary statementThe kinematics of walking behavior in Drosophila can be decomposed into general aspects of motor output and idiosyncrasies of individual flies.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors---such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure---on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but has rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from &gt;400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the  interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain stable over long time periods. The stability of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animals individuality, or personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The ongoing  person-situation debate in humans and observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether animal behavior also remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The stability of three individual traits (exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, stability of behavior always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. In summary, our work demonstrates that similar to humans, animal individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Migration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In flying animals, wing morphology jointly evolves with flight behaviours. Whether seasonal polymorphism in butterfly wing morphology is linked to divergent flight behaviour is however not known. Here we compared the flight behaviour and the morphology between the spring and the summer forms of two closely related, temperate species, Pieris napi and P. rapae. We first quantify three-dimensional flight behaviour by reconstructing individual flight trajectories using stereoscopic high-speed videography in an experimental cage. We then measure wing size and shape characteristics assumed to influence flight behaviours in butterflies. We show that seasonal, but not interspecific, differences in flight behaviour might be associated with divergent forewing shapes, either elongated or rounded wings. In Pieris spring forms, individuals are small and have elongated forewings, which are significantly correlated with low speed and acceleration, but with high flight curvature. Large Pieris summer individuals exhibit rounded forewings, which are correlated with high flight speed, turning acceleration, and advance ratio. We interpret such results as potentially adaptive flight behaviours in Pieris. Curvy flight trajectories in the spring forms may be a specialised foraging behaviour evolving in response to newly emerging feeding and oviposition resources. In contrast, the summer forms high flight speed and flight efficiency may be advantageous for dispersal to new habitats. Further, the recorded higher acceleration capacities of the summer form could have evolved in response to higher predation pressure. Our study provides quantitative evidence of divergent flight behaviours between seasonal forms of Pieris butterflies correlated with differences in wing morphology. Seasonal flight behaviour could be adaptive, possibly driven by the interaction of various seasonal selection pressures, including resource distribution (nectar and larval food plants), predator and parasitoid pressure, and thermoregulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In species that learn their song, cultural transmission of song components can lead to the accumulation of variants that differ among populations, resulting in the formation of dialects. Three avian clades are thought to have independently evolved song learning - parrots, oscine passerines, and hummingbirds. Dialects have mainly been studied in passerines. We extend the study of dialects to the bee hummingbird clade, focusing on Annas and Costas hummingbirds (Calypte anna and C. costae). Both species are vocal learners. Annas produces complex, three phrase, multi-syllable songs and Costas produces simple, one phrase songs. We recorded 5-24 males per population (5 Costas and 6 Annas populations) across the species ranges in the Western United States and tested for evidence of geographic variation in song. We found minor population differences in frequency measures of Costas song, but song form was invariant across populations. Annas song was contrastingly variable with population differences in both syllable use and multiple spectral and temporal measures. The most strongly differentiated Annas population in our study, Seattle (Washington State), is the product of a recent northward range expansion facilitated by human activities that provide additional food sources for hummingbirds. The loss and modification of syllables in this population is suggestive of a founder effect on song. This study provides insight into song evolution in non-passerine vocal learners and contributes to understanding of how complex signals evolve.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects use walking behavior in a large number of contexts, such as exploration, foraging, escape and pursuit, or migration. A lot is known on how nervous systems produce this behavior in general and also how certain parameters vary with regard to walking direction or speed, for instance. An aspect that has not received much attention is if and how walking behavior varies across individuals of a particular species. To address this, we created a large corpus of kinematic walking data of many individuals of the fruit fly Drosophila. We only selected instances of straight walking in a narrow range of walking speeds to minimize the influence of these high-level parameters, aiming to uncover more subtle aspects of variability. Using high-speed videography and automated annotation we captured the positions of the six leg tips for thousands of steps and used principal components analysis to characterize the postural space individuals used during walking. Our analysis shows that the largest part of walking kinematics can be described by five principal components (PCs). Separation of these five PCs into a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional subspace was found to divide the description of walking behavior into invariant features shared across individuals and features that relate to the specifics of individuals; the latter features can be regarded as idiosyncrasies. We also demonstrate that this approach can detect the effects of experimental interventions in an unbiased manner and that general aspects of individuality, such as the average width of the individual walking posture, can be described.

Summary statementThe kinematics of walking behavior in Drosophila can be decomposed into general aspects of motor output and idiosyncrasies of individual flies.</p>
