T.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571650\nThe formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.\nRats rely on airflow cues for self-motion perception\nAuthors: Polat, L.; Harpaz, T.; Zaidel, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572298\nSelf-motion perception is a vital skill for all species. It is an inherently multisensory process, that combines inertial (body-based) and relative (with respect to the environment) motion cues. While extensively studied in human and non-human primates, there is currently no paradigm to test self-motion perception in rodents using both inertial and relative self-motion cues. We developed a novel rodent motion simulator using two synchronized robotic arms to generate inertial, relative or combined (inertial and relative) cues of self-motion. Eight rats were trained to perform a task of heading-discrimination, similar to the popular primate paradigm. Strikingly, the rats relied heavily on airflow for relative self-motion perception, with little contribution from optic flow (performance in the dark was almost as good). Relative self-motion (airflow) was perceived with greater reliability vs. inertial. Disrupting airflow (using a fan or windshield) damaged relative, but not inertial, self-motion perception. However, whiskers were not needed for this function. Lastly, the rats integrated relative and inertial self-motion cues in a reliability-based (Bayesian-like) manner. These results implicate airflow as a dominant cue for self-motion perception in rats, and provide a new domain to investigate the neural bases of self-motion perception and multisensory processing in awake behaving rodents.\nCryptic female choice in response to male pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Doubovetzky, N.; Kohlmeier, P.; Bal, S.; Billeter, J.-C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572608\nFemales control the paternity of their offspring by selectively mating with males they perceive to be of high quality. In species where females mate with multiple males in succession, females may bias offspring paternity by favoring the sperm of one male over another, a process known as cryptic female choice (CFC). While evidence of CFC exists in multiple taxa, the mechanisms underlying this process have remained difficult to unravel. Understanding CFC requires demonstration of a female-driven post mating bias in sperm use and paternity, and a causal link between this bias and male cues. Here, we show that in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, mated females eject the ejaculate of the first male they mated with faster when exposed to the pheromones of an attractive male than in the presence of an unattractive one. Using transgenic males expressing fluorescent sperm, we show that exposure to attractive males between mating causes twice-mated females to bias sperm storage towards the second male, affecting paternity. Using pheromonal bioassays in combination with genetic manipulation of sensory systems, we show that females modulate ejaculate ejection latency in response to male pheromones heptanal and 11-cis-Vaccenyl acetate (cVA) sensed via olfactory receptor neurons OR35a, Or22a, Or65a and OR67d, demonstrating that polyandrous females use male pheromonal cues to modulate ejaculate ejection timing and impact paternity. We provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of a CFC mechanism allowing a female to increase or decrease the share of paternity of her first mate depending on the sensing of the quality of potential mates in her environment. These findings showcase that paternity can be influenced by events that go beyond copulation and highlights the importance of post-copulatory sexual selection.\nThe demographic drivers of cultural evolution in bird song: a multilevel study\nAuthors: Recalde, N. M.; Estandia, A.; Keen, S. C.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452\nSocial learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from \u003e400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.\nContrasting roles of Beclin-1 in pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviours in a mouse model of neuropathic pain\nAuthors: Zaheer, F.; Levine, G. J.; Simal, A. L.; Reid, P. O.; Fatemi, R.; Martino, T. A.; Descalzi, G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572240\nChronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting 1 in 5 adults globally1. The current understanding of chronic pain remains inadequate, coupled with few available therapeutics for the treatment of associated mental health disorders. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions and investigation at the cellular levels may reveal a better understanding of the processes that occur leading to the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found that adult male mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function show enhanced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared to wildtype controls. Remarkably, we found that while SNI induced increases in anxiety-like behaviours in wildtype mice, this was not observed in mice with impaired BECLIN-1 protein function. Our data thus indicates that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotion related effects of chronic neuropathic pain.\nSubstantial decline of phasic dopamine signaling in senescent male rats does not impact dopamine-dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\nAuthors: Sandberg, S. G.; Stanford, C. A.; Phillips, P. E. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572806\nNormal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\nMCFBM: a behavioral analysis system enabling objective inference of songbirds' attention during social interactions\nAuthors: Fujibayashi, M.; Abe, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573152\nUnderstanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention\nARBUR: a Machine Learning-based Analysis System for Relating Behaviors and Ultrasonic Vocalizations of Rats\nAuthors: Jia, G.; Chen, Z.; Zhou, Q.; Zhang, Y.; Quan, Z.; Chen, X.; Fukuda, T.; Huang, Q.; Shi, Q.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572288\nDeciphering how different types of behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of rats interact can yield insights into the neural basis of social interaction. However, the behavior-vocalization interplay of rats remains elusive because of the challenges of relating the two communication media in complex social contexts. Here, we propose a machine learning-based analysis system called ARBUR. ARBUR can cluster without bias both non-step (continuous) and step USVs via three steps, hierarchically detect eight types of behavior of two freely behaving rats with high accuracy, and locate the vocal rat in 3-D space. By simultaneously recording the video and ultrasonic streams of two freely behaving rats, we show that ARBUR can not only automatically reveal the well-understood behavior-associated vocalizations that were carefully concluded by other behavioral researchers, but also hold the promise to indicate novel findings that can be hardly found by manual analysis, especially regarding step USVs and the active/passive rat-associated vocalizations during aggressive/intimate social behaviors. Using ARBUR, we further confirm that rats communicate via distinct USVs when engaging in different types of social behavior. This work could help mechanistically understand the interactive influence between the behavior and USVs of rats.\nChemotactile perception and associative learning of amino acids in yellowjacket workers\nAuthors: Mattiacci, A.; Pietrantuono, A. L.; Corley, J. C.; Masciocchi, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.572014\nLearning and memory are essential for animal survival, influencing preferences, decision-making, and foraging behaviour. In this study, we explore the perceptual and learning abilities of Vespula germanica (yellowjacket wasps) to various amino acids. We hypothesize that V. germanica can qualitatively evaluate various amino acid solutions, given their scavenging habits and the possibility of metabolizing amino acids to fuel energy. Through chemo-tactile differential conditioning, we studied worker wasp maxilla labium extension response (MaLER) to essential (Lysine, Tryptophan, Arginine) and non-essential amino acids (Ornithine, Aspartic acid, Glycine). Conditioning sessions included individual amino acids against water and comparisons between different amino acids. Additionally, we tested retention, discrimination, and generalization abilities, 30 minutes later with conditioned and novel stimuli. Our results show that wasps exhibit the ability to learn and discriminate various amino acids. The discrimination capacity extended to differentiating between pairs of amino acids. Memory retention was generally robust, but certain associations observed during conditioning did not persist after a 30-minute interval. Moreover, when wasps were trained with essential amino acids, the acquired learning did not generally extend to other non-essential amino acids, except for Arginine, which exhibited generalization when tested with its precursor, Ornithine. Conversely, when trained with non-essential amino acids, the acquired learning generalized to other essential amino acids. These results suggest that, unlike other hymenopterans, wasps can detect, discriminate, and generalize free amino acids, crucial for their foraging decisions. This knowledge contributes to understanding the cognitive dimensions of V. germanica and their implications for targeted pest management. Summary statementThis study on Vespula germanicas amino acid perception enhances our understanding of foraging behaviours. The findings contribute to insect cognition studies, with potential implications for pest management.\nHemolymph transfusions transfer heritable learned novel odor preferences to naive larvae of Bicyclus anynana butterflies\nAuthors: Gowri, V.; Monteiro, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572719\nThe mechanisms whereby environmental experiences of parents are transmitted to their offspring to impact their behavior and fitness are poorly understood. Previously, we showed that naive Bicyclus anynana butterfly larvae, whose parents fed on a normal plant feed but coated with a novel odor, inherited a learned preference towards that odor, which had initially elicited avoidance in the naive parents. Here, we performed simple hemolymph transfusions from odor-fed and control-fed larvae to naive larval recipients. We found that larvae injected with hemolymph from odor-fed donors stopped avoiding the novel odor, and their naive offspring preferred the odor more, compared to the offspring of larvae injected with control hemolymph. These results indicate that factors in the hemolymph, potentially the odor molecule itself, play an important role in odor learning and preference transmission across generations. Furthermore, this mechanism of odor preference inheritance, mediated by the hemolymph, bypasses the peripheral odor-sensing mechanisms taking place in the antennae, mouthparts, or legs, and may mediate host plant switching and diversification in the Lepidoptera or more broadly across insects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-motion perception is a vital skill for all species. It is an inherently multisensory process, that combines inertial (body-based) and relative (with respect to the environment) motion cues. While extensively studied in human and non-human primates, there is currently no paradigm to test self-motion perception in rodents using both inertial and relative self-motion cues. We developed a novel rodent motion simulator using two synchronized robotic arms to generate inertial, relative or combined (inertial and relative) cues of self-motion. Eight rats were trained to perform a task of heading-discrimination, similar to the popular primate paradigm. Strikingly, the rats relied heavily on airflow for relative self-motion perception, with little contribution from optic flow (performance in the dark was almost as good). Relative self-motion (airflow) was perceived with greater reliability vs. inertial. Disrupting airflow (using a fan or windshield) damaged relative, but not inertial, self-motion perception. However, whiskers were not needed for this function. Lastly, the rats integrated relative and inertial self-motion cues in a reliability-based (Bayesian-like) manner. These results implicate airflow as a dominant cue for self-motion perception in rats, and provide a new domain to investigate the neural bases of self-motion perception and multisensory processing in awake behaving rodents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Females control the paternity of their offspring by selectively mating with males they perceive to be of high quality. In species where females mate with multiple males in succession, females may bias offspring paternity by favoring the sperm of one male over another, a process known as cryptic female choice (CFC). While evidence of CFC exists in multiple taxa, the mechanisms underlying this process have remained difficult to unravel. Understanding CFC requires demonstration of a female-driven post mating bias in sperm use and paternity, and a causal link between this bias and male cues. Here, we show that in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, mated females eject the ejaculate of the first male they mated with faster when exposed to the pheromones of an attractive male than in the presence of an unattractive one. Using transgenic males expressing fluorescent sperm, we show that exposure to attractive males between mating causes twice-mated females to bias sperm storage towards the second male, affecting paternity. Using pheromonal bioassays in combination with genetic manipulation of sensory systems, we show that females modulate ejaculate ejection latency in response to male pheromones heptanal and 11-cis-Vaccenyl acetate (cVA) sensed via olfactory receptor neurons OR35a, Or22a, Or65a and OR67d, demonstrating that polyandrous females use male pheromonal cues to modulate ejaculate ejection timing and impact paternity. We provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of a CFC mechanism allowing a female to increase or decrease the share of paternity of her first mate depending on the sensing of the quality of potential mates in her environment. These findings showcase that paternity can be influenced by events that go beyond copulation and highlights the importance of post-copulatory sexual selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from &gt;400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting 1 in 5 adults globally1. The current understanding of chronic pain remains inadequate, coupled with few available therapeutics for the treatment of associated mental health disorders. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions and investigation at the cellular levels may reveal a better understanding of the processes that occur leading to the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found that adult male mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function show enhanced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared to wildtype controls. Remarkably, we found that while SNI induced increases in anxiety-like behaviours in wildtype mice, this was not observed in mice with impaired BECLIN-1 protein function. Our data thus indicates that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotion related effects of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention</p>

        <p class="abstract">Deciphering how different types of behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of rats interact can yield insights into the neural basis of social interaction. However, the behavior-vocalization interplay of rats remains elusive because of the challenges of relating the two communication media in complex social contexts. Here, we propose a machine learning-based analysis system called ARBUR. ARBUR can cluster without bias both non-step (continuous) and step USVs via three steps, hierarchically detect eight types of behavior of two freely behaving rats with high accuracy, and locate the vocal rat in 3-D space. By simultaneously recording the video and ultrasonic streams of two freely behaving rats, we show that ARBUR can not only automatically reveal the well-understood behavior-associated vocalizations that were carefully concluded by other behavioral researchers, but also hold the promise to indicate novel findings that can be hardly found by manual analysis, especially regarding step USVs and the active/passive rat-associated vocalizations during aggressive/intimate social behaviors. Using ARBUR, we further confirm that rats communicate via distinct USVs when engaging in different types of social behavior. This work could help mechanistically understand the interactive influence between the behavior and USVs of rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning and memory are essential for animal survival, influencing preferences, decision-making, and foraging behaviour. In this study, we explore the perceptual and learning abilities of Vespula germanica (yellowjacket wasps) to various amino acids. We hypothesize that V. germanica can qualitatively evaluate various amino acid solutions, given their scavenging habits and the possibility of metabolizing amino acids to fuel energy. Through chemo-tactile differential conditioning, we studied worker wasp maxilla labium extension response (MaLER) to essential (Lysine, Tryptophan, Arginine) and non-essential amino acids (Ornithine, Aspartic acid, Glycine). Conditioning sessions included individual amino acids against water and comparisons between different amino acids. Additionally, we tested retention, discrimination, and generalization abilities, 30 minutes later with conditioned and novel stimuli. Our results show that wasps exhibit the ability to learn and discriminate various amino acids. The discrimination capacity extended to differentiating between pairs of amino acids. Memory retention was generally robust, but certain associations observed during conditioning did not persist after a 30-minute interval. Moreover, when wasps were trained with essential amino acids, the acquired learning did not generally extend to other non-essential amino acids, except for Arginine, which exhibited generalization when tested with its precursor, Ornithine. Conversely, when trained with non-essential amino acids, the acquired learning generalized to other essential amino acids. These results suggest that, unlike other hymenopterans, wasps can detect, discriminate, and generalize free amino acids, crucial for their foraging decisions. This knowledge contributes to understanding the cognitive dimensions of V. germanica and their implications for targeted pest management.

Summary statementThis study on Vespula germanicas amino acid perception enhances our understanding of foraging behaviours. The findings contribute to insect cognition studies, with potential implications for pest management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms whereby environmental experiences of parents are transmitted to their offspring to impact their behavior and fitness are poorly understood. Previously, we showed that naive Bicyclus anynana butterfly larvae, whose parents fed on a normal plant feed but coated with a novel odor, inherited a learned preference towards that odor, which had initially elicited avoidance in the naive parents. Here, we performed simple hemolymph transfusions from odor-fed and control-fed larvae to naive larval recipients. We found that larvae injected with hemolymph from odor-fed donors stopped avoiding the novel odor, and their naive offspring preferred the odor more, compared to the offspring of larvae injected with control hemolymph. These results indicate that factors in the hemolymph, potentially the odor molecule itself, play an important role in odor learning and preference transmission across generations. Furthermore, this mechanism of odor preference inheritance, mediated by the hemolymph, bypasses the peripheral odor-sensing mechanisms taking place in the antennae, mouthparts, or legs, and may mediate host plant switching and diversification in the Lepidoptera or more broadly across insects.</p>
