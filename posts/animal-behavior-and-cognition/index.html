R.; Eggert, A.; Manteuffel, C.; Rault, J.-L.\nScore: 117.2, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.17.533160\nHelping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.\nAn adaptable, user-friendly score sheet to monitor welfare in experimental fish\nAuthors: Flueck, M.; Schmidt-Posthaus, H.; Bergadano, A.; Adrian-Kalchhauser, I.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549642\nFish are increasingly used as experimental animals in a wide range of research fields. As of 2022, a quarter of all experimental animals used in Europe are fish, with an upward trend. At the same time, less than 20% of these are zebrafish. At the same time, welfare assessments for experimental fish are in their infancy compared to rodents. This can be attributed to the diversity of species used, the relative recency of fish as go-to model for research, and challenges to assess welfare and pain in non-vocal underwater species. The lack of assessment guidelines and easy-to-use tools is a challenge for researchers (particularly, for newcomers to the field of fish), for ethics committees, and prevents the rigorous implementation of the 3Rs (particularly, refinement). Here, we present an adaptable, user-friendly scoring tool for fish. The parameters contained in the tool are based on a literature review, have been validated by expert interviews, and weighted by a fish pathologist. The tool allows to score individuals as well as groups and provides a visualization of trends. We provide the associated literature and give detailed examples and instructions on the adaptation and use of the scoring tool. We hope that this tool to score fish welfare will empower researchers to include welfare assessment in their routines, foster discussions on fish welfare parameters among scientists, facilitate interactions with ethics commites, and most importantly, enable continous refinement of fish experiments.\nNeuromolecular responses in disrupted mutualistic cleaning interactions under future environmental conditions\nAuthors: Ramirez-Calero, S. P.; Paula, J. R.; Otjacques, E.; Ravasi, T.; Rosa, R.; Schunter, C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549851\nMutualistic interactions, which constitute some of the most advantageous interactions among fish species, are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. A key mutualistic interaction is the cleaning service rendered by the cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which involves intricate processes of social behaviour to remove ectoparasites from client fish and can be altered in near-future environmental conditions. Here, we evaluated the neuromolecular mechanisms behind the behavioural disruption of cleaning interactions in response to future environments. We subjected cleaner wrasses and surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon, serving as clients) to elevated temperature (Warming, 32{degrees}C), increased levels of CO2 (High CO2, 1000 ppm), and a combined condition of elevated CO2 and temperature (Warming \u0026 High CO2, 32{degrees}C \u0026 1000 ppm) for 28 days. Each of these conditions resulted in behavioural disruptions concerning the motivation to interact and the quality of interaction (High CO2 -80.7%, Warming - 92.6%, Warming \u0026 High CO2 -79.5%, p\u003c0.001). Using transcriptomic of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, we discovered that most transcriptional reprogramming in both species under warming conditions occurred primarily in the hind- and forebrain. The associated functions under warming were linked to stress, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, and behaviour. In contrast, elevated CO2 exposure affected a range of functions associated with GABA, behaviour, visual perception, and circadian rhythm. Interestingly, in the combined Warming \u0026 High CO2 condition, we did not observe any expression changes of behaviour. However, we did find signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, suggesting not only an additive effect of the environmental conditions but also a trade-off between physiological performance and behaviour in the cleaner wrasse. We suggest that impending environmental shifts can affect the behaviour and molecular processes that sustain mutualistic interactions between L. dimidiatus and its clients, which could have a cascading effect on their adaptation potential and possibly cause large-scale impacts on coral reef ecosystems.\nIndividuals lack the capacity to accurately detect emotional piloerection\nAuthors: McPhetres, J.; Han, A.; Gao, H. H.; Kemp, N.; Khati, B.; Pu, C. X.; Smith, A.; Shui, X.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549671\nPiloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being \"emotionally moved\" and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance. Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.\nReciprocal social ties drive stability within a social network\nAuthors: Dakin, R.; Clunis, P.; Cornthwaite, E.; Ryder, T. B.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2020.11.06.371567\nSocial reciprocity is thought to be the most important driver of cooperation among non-kin, but its effects within complex social networks where individuals choose their partners have not been studied. Here, we test whether reciprocation can explain social dynamics in a bird species where males form coalitions to court females, the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda). In our study population, approximately a third of male-male social interactions involve one male leaving his territory to interact and display with the owner of another territory; this directional behaviour provides benefits to the recipient at a cost to the visiting male. We characterize social ties among pairs of territory holders according to the directionality of their interactions, and show here that territory holding males engaged in far more reciprocated (bidirectional) partnerships with other territory holders than expected by chance. Reciprocated partnerships were also stronger (i.e., the partners interacted more frequently) than non-reciprocated partnerships, controlling for spatial proximity of the territories. An individual-level analysis revealed that a males social contribution to a given partner was predictive of the number of social interactions he received from that same partner. Finally, we show that reciprocation predicted the long-term stability of social partnerships one year later. Together, these results demonstrate that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks where partner choice is flexible. LAY SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhen animals are free to choose their partners, how does reciprocity influence social dynamics?C_ST_ABSIn the wire-tailed manakin, males form coalitions with other males to help attract mates. We tracked male social networks and found that some males form reciprocal partnerships where each male leaves its territory to display at the others territory. These bidirectional partnerships are particularly strong and stable, indicating that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks.\nHummingbirds use wing inertial effects to improve maneuverability\nAuthors: Haque, M. N.; Cheng, B.; Tobalske, B. W.; Luo, H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550104\nHummingbirds outperform other birds in terms of aerial agility at low flight speeds. To reveal the key mechanisms that enable such unparalleled agility, we reconstructed body and wing motion of hummingbird escape maneuvers from high-speed videos; then, we performed computational fluid dynamics modeling and flight mechanics analysis, in which each wingbeat was resolved. We found that the birds utilized the inertia of their wings to achieve peak body rotational acceleration within half a wingbeat before the aerodynamic forces became dominant. The aerodynamic forces instead counteracted the reversed inertial forces in the other half wingbeat, thereby to sustain body rotation, albeit at a lower acceleration. Thus, individual wingbeat cycles that generated body rotations can be split into an agility phase with rapid inertial acceleration, and a stability phase with counteracting aerodynamic and inertial acceleration. This mechanism involving inertial steering enables hummingbirds to generate instantaneous body acceleration at any phase of a wingbeat, and it is likely the key to understanding the unique dexterity distinguishing them from aircraft that solely rely on aerodynamics for maneuvering.\nA mouse model of ATRX deficiency with cognitive deficits and autistic traits\nAuthors: Quesnel, K. M.; Martin-Kenny, N.; Berube, N. G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549759\nATRX is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein with essential roles in safeguarding genome integrity and modulating gene expression. Deficiencies in this protein cause ATR-X syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and an array of developmental abnormalities, including features of autism. Previous studies demonstrated that deleting ATRX in mouse forebrain excitatory neurons postnatally resulted in male-specific memory deficits. Here, we introduce a new model where ATRX is deleted at earlier embryonic stages, resulting in a broader spectrum of impairments, including contextual fear memory deficits, decreased anxiety, hyperactivity, as well as self-injurious and stereotyped behaviours. Sex-specific alterations were also observed, with males displaying heightened aggression and impaired sensory gating, while females exhibit social avoidance. Collectively, the findings indicate that early developmental abnormalities arising from ATRX deficiency in neurons contribute to of the presentation of autistic-like behaviours. Summary StatementMice with embryonic loss of ATRX in excitatory neurons represent a clinically relevant model to study sexually dimorphic alterations in cognitive and autistic traits.\nGeomagnetic orientation in subterranean mole crickets during burrowing\nAuthors: Endo, T.; Ando, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548821\nWhile many terrestrial animals use celestial and terrestrial cues for orientation, subterranean animals lack access to these cues. The geomagnetic field serves as a reliable alternative cue for underground navigation. Subterranean mammals use the geomagnetic field to burrow and navigate within their nests; however, whether subterranean insects possess magnetoreception remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of magnetic fields on burrowing directions in subterranean mole crickets (Gryllotalpa orientalis). Under an intact magnetic field, mole crickets predominantly burrow in the north-south direction. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90{degrees}, the preferred burrowing direction shifted to the east-west axis. Notably, when the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field was reduced to near 0 {micro}T, no preferred direction was observed. These results suggest that mole crickets have a magnetic sense and they align the direction at the beginning of burrowing. The study enhances our comprehension of underground orientation mechanisms in subterranean insects and reveals convergent evolution between insects and mammals in utilizing the geomagnetic field as a navigational cue.\nSocial influences on delayed gratification in New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays\nAuthors: Miller, R.; Davies, J.; Schiestl, M.; Garcia-Pelegrin, E.; Gray, R. D.; Taylor, A. H.; Clayton, N. S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549039\nSelf-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Helping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fish are increasingly used as experimental animals in a wide range of research fields. As of 2022, a quarter of all experimental animals used in Europe are fish, with an upward trend. At the same time, less than 20% of these are zebrafish. At the same time, welfare assessments for experimental fish are in their infancy compared to rodents. This can be attributed to the diversity of species used, the relative recency of fish as go-to model for research, and challenges to assess welfare and pain in non-vocal underwater species. The lack of assessment guidelines and easy-to-use tools is a challenge for researchers (particularly, for newcomers to the field of fish), for ethics committees, and prevents the rigorous implementation of the 3Rs (particularly, refinement).

Here, we present an adaptable, user-friendly scoring tool for fish. The parameters contained in the tool are based on a literature review, have been validated by expert interviews, and weighted by a fish pathologist. The tool allows to score individuals as well as groups and provides a visualization of trends. We provide the associated literature and give detailed examples and instructions on the adaptation and use of the scoring tool.

We hope that this tool to score fish welfare will empower researchers to include welfare assessment in their routines, foster discussions on fish welfare parameters among scientists, facilitate interactions with ethics commites, and most importantly, enable continous refinement of fish experiments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutualistic interactions, which constitute some of the most advantageous interactions among fish species, are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. A key mutualistic interaction is the cleaning service rendered by the cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which involves intricate processes of social behaviour to remove ectoparasites from client fish and can be altered in near-future environmental conditions. Here, we evaluated the neuromolecular mechanisms behind the behavioural disruption of cleaning interactions in response to future environments. We subjected cleaner wrasses and surgeonfish (Acanthurus leucosternon, serving as clients) to elevated temperature (Warming, 32{degrees}C), increased levels of CO2 (High CO2, 1000 ppm), and a combined condition of elevated CO2 and temperature (Warming &amp; High CO2, 32{degrees}C &amp; 1000 ppm) for 28 days. Each of these conditions resulted in behavioural disruptions concerning the motivation to interact and the quality of interaction (High CO2 -80.7%, Warming - 92.6%, Warming &amp; High CO2 -79.5%, p&lt;0.001). Using transcriptomic of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, we discovered that most transcriptional reprogramming in both species under warming conditions occurred primarily in the hind- and forebrain. The associated functions under warming were linked to stress, heat shock proteins, hypoxia, and behaviour. In contrast, elevated CO2 exposure affected a range of functions associated with GABA, behaviour, visual perception, and circadian rhythm. Interestingly, in the combined Warming &amp; High CO2 condition, we did not observe any expression changes of behaviour. However, we did find signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, suggesting not only an additive effect of the environmental conditions but also a trade-off between physiological performance and behaviour in the cleaner wrasse. We suggest that impending environmental shifts can affect the behaviour and molecular processes that sustain mutualistic interactions between L. dimidiatus and its clients, which could have a cascading effect on their adaptation potential and possibly cause large-scale impacts on coral reef ecosystems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being &#34;emotionally moved&#34; and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.

Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social reciprocity is thought to be the most important driver of cooperation among non-kin, but its effects within complex social networks where individuals choose their partners have not been studied. Here, we test whether reciprocation can explain social dynamics in a bird species where males form coalitions to court females, the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda). In our study population, approximately a third of male-male social interactions involve one male leaving his territory to interact and display with the owner of another territory; this directional behaviour provides benefits to the recipient at a cost to the visiting male. We characterize social ties among pairs of territory holders according to the directionality of their interactions, and show here that territory holding males engaged in far more reciprocated (bidirectional) partnerships with other territory holders than expected by chance. Reciprocated partnerships were also stronger (i.e., the partners interacted more frequently) than non-reciprocated partnerships, controlling for spatial proximity of the territories. An individual-level analysis revealed that a males social contribution to a given partner was predictive of the number of social interactions he received from that same partner. Finally, we show that reciprocation predicted the long-term stability of social partnerships one year later. Together, these results demonstrate that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks where partner choice is flexible.

LAY SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhen animals are free to choose their partners, how does reciprocity influence social dynamics?C_ST_ABSIn the wire-tailed manakin, males form coalitions with other males to help attract mates. We tracked male social networks and found that some males form reciprocal partnerships where each male leaves its territory to display at the others territory. These bidirectional partnerships are particularly strong and stable, indicating that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hummingbirds outperform other birds in terms of aerial agility at low flight speeds. To reveal the key mechanisms that enable such unparalleled agility, we reconstructed body and wing motion of hummingbird escape maneuvers from high-speed videos; then, we performed computational fluid dynamics modeling and flight mechanics analysis, in which each wingbeat was resolved. We found that the birds utilized the inertia of their wings to achieve peak body rotational acceleration within half a wingbeat before the aerodynamic forces became dominant. The aerodynamic forces instead counteracted the reversed inertial forces in the other half wingbeat, thereby to sustain body rotation, albeit at a lower acceleration. Thus, individual wingbeat cycles that generated body rotations can be split into an agility phase with rapid inertial acceleration, and a stability phase with counteracting aerodynamic and inertial acceleration. This mechanism involving inertial steering enables hummingbirds to generate instantaneous body acceleration at any phase of a wingbeat, and it is likely the key to understanding the unique dexterity distinguishing them from aircraft that solely rely on aerodynamics for maneuvering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ATRX is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein with essential roles in safeguarding genome integrity and modulating gene expression. Deficiencies in this protein cause ATR-X syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and an array of developmental abnormalities, including features of autism. Previous studies demonstrated that deleting ATRX in mouse forebrain excitatory neurons postnatally resulted in male-specific memory deficits. Here, we introduce a new model where ATRX is deleted at earlier embryonic stages, resulting in a broader spectrum of impairments, including contextual fear memory deficits, decreased anxiety, hyperactivity, as well as self-injurious and stereotyped behaviours. Sex-specific alterations were also observed, with males displaying heightened aggression and impaired sensory gating, while females exhibit social avoidance. Collectively, the findings indicate that early developmental abnormalities arising from ATRX deficiency in neurons contribute to of the presentation of autistic-like behaviours.

Summary StatementMice with embryonic loss of ATRX in excitatory neurons represent a clinically relevant model to study sexually dimorphic alterations in cognitive and autistic traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While many terrestrial animals use celestial and terrestrial cues for orientation, subterranean animals lack access to these cues. The geomagnetic field serves as a reliable alternative cue for underground navigation. Subterranean mammals use the geomagnetic field to burrow and navigate within their nests; however, whether subterranean insects possess magnetoreception remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of magnetic fields on burrowing directions in subterranean mole crickets (Gryllotalpa orientalis). Under an intact magnetic field, mole crickets predominantly burrow in the north-south direction. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90{degrees}, the preferred burrowing direction shifted to the east-west axis. Notably, when the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field was reduced to near 0 {micro}T, no preferred direction was observed. These results suggest that mole crickets have a magnetic sense and they align the direction at the beginning of burrowing. The study enhances our comprehension of underground orientation mechanisms in subterranean insects and reveals convergent evolution between insects and mammals in utilizing the geomagnetic field as a navigational cue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the  rotating-tray paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non- competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.</p>
