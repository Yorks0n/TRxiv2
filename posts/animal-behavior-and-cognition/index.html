S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 124.1, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nMale-biased stone tool use by wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)\nAuthors: Goldsborough, Z.; Crofoot, M. C.; Barrett, B. J.\nScore: 21.7, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556228\nTool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)--some of which engage in habitual stone tool use--provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.\nSimultaneous recording of ultrasonic vocalizations and sniffing from socially interacting individual rats using a miniature microphone\nAuthors: John, S. R.; Tiwari, R.; Goussha, Y.; Amar, R.; Bizer, A.; Netser, S.; Wagner, S.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556068\nVocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors. MotivationHere, we sought to solve the problem of identifying the emitter of a specific vocalization during free social interaction of animal models. The use of a miniature microphone carried by the subject and connected to its nasal cavity solved this challenge and allowed for assignment of any vocalization recorded during a social interaction to a specific individual. Moreover, the miniature microphone enabled simultaneous recording of sniffing and vocalization activities of an individual, thus facilitating recognition of the internal states underlying these traits.\nIntragroup sociality drives individual participation in intergroup competition in an urban-dwelling nonhuman primate\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Kaburu, S. S. K.; Balasubramaniam, K. N.; Marty, P. R.; Beisner, B.; Bliss-Moreau, E.; Mohan, L.; Rattan, S. K.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556573\nThere is significant variability in the extent to which individuals from group-living species participate in intergroup competition (IGC) over resources. Such variability may be particularly robust in human-impacted environments, wherein anthropogenic resources may strongly impact intergroup overlap and competition. Examining the socio-ecological causal factors driving these differences can shed new lights on animals costs-benefits trade-offs driving engagement in such interactions. Here we use (peri)urban-dwelling rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as model-systems to examine how individual differences in socio-ecological characteristics (i.e., animals sex, rank, and affiliative connections) may influence propensities to participate in IGC in anthropogenic environments. We found that participation was strongly influenced by individuals affiliative connections. Interestingly, monkeys with more coalitionary support partners had higher IGC participation, but this was more pronounced for individuals that are more peripheral in their proximity and multilayer affiliative networks, compared to more socially central individuals. Moreover, males and low-ranking individuals were more likely to participate in IGC. Our findings suggest that differential access to socio-ecological resources likely drives IGC participation. The evaluation of such inter-individual differences in socio-ecological flexibility and decision-making in dynamic environments is critical for future research related to the links between behavioural ecology, health outcomes, and human-wildlife co-existence in anthropogenic landscapes.\nEavesdropping and the audience effect in fighting fruit flies reveal feedback between social information use and production\nAuthors: Hutchins, M.; Saltz, J.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555942\nSocial information use and production occur simultaneously during social learning events; however, these two processes are often studied independently. We propose that social information use and production represent a feedback loop: eavesdroppers influence the behaviors of those being observed, which then alters the eavesdroppers social decisions. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the relationship between social information use and production in an aggressive context. We quantified aggressive behavior between two males being observed by either a male, female, or no one. We then measured variation in social information use by allowing the eavesdroppers to interact directly with the observed males and compared their behavior to individuals who did not observe the aggressive encounter. Male eavesdroppers caused the observed males to decrease their aggressive behaviors, thus altering their social information production. Male eavesdroppers were then less likely to attack observed contest winners than males without social information. Female eavesdroppers did not elicit any change in the aggression of the two males, and female eavesdroppers did not use social information to inform their mating decisions. Overall, we found support for the feedback loop in males, but not females: information was exchanged bi-directionally during eavesdropping events, resulting in the modification of behavior by all parties.\nMacaqueNet: big-team research into the biological drivers of social relationships\nAuthors: De Moor, D.; MacaqueNet, ; Skelton, M.; Schulke, O.; Ostner, J.; Neumann, C.; Duboscq, J.; Brent, L. J. N.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.552971\nAbstract 1. For many animals, social relationships are a key determinant of fitness. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of the adaptive function, ontogeny, evolution, and mechanistic underpinnings of social relationships. There is a vast and ever-accumulating amount of social behavioural data on individually recognised animals, an incredible resource to shed light onto the biological basis of social relationships. Yet, the full potential of such data lies in comparative research across taxa with distinct life histories and ecologies. Substantial challenges impede systematic comparisons, one of which is the lack of persistent, accessible, and standardised databases. 2. Here, we advocate for the creation of big-team collaborations and comparative databases to unlock the wealth of behavioural data for research on social relationships by introducing MacaqueNet (https://macaquenet.github.io/). 3. As a global collaboration of over 100 researchers, the MacaqueNet database encompasses data from 1981 to the present on 14 species and is the first publicly searchable and standardised database on affiliative and agonistic animal social networks. With substantial inter-specific variation in ecology and social structure and the first published record on macaque behaviour dating back to 1956, macaque research has already contributed to answering fundamental questions on the biological bases and evolution of social relationships. Building on these strong foundations, we believe that MacaqueNet can further promote collaborative and comparative research on social behaviour. 4. We believe that big-team approaches to building standardised databases, bringing together data contributors and researchers, will aid much-needed large-scale comparative research in behavioural ecology and beyond. We describe the establishment of MacaqueNet, from starting a large-scale collective to the creation of a cross-species collaborative database and the implementation of data entry and retrieval protocols. As such, we hope to provide a functional example for future endeavours of large-scale collaborative research into the biology of social behaviour.\nLearning when to learn: hummingbirds adjust their exploration behaviour to match the value of information\nAuthors: Donkersteeg, C.; Peters, H.; Jerome, C.; Menzies, C.; Welch, K. C.; Guillette, L.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556950\nExploration is a key part of an animal's ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.\nGaining proficiency in flight transforms energy landscapes during ontogeny\nAuthors: Nourani, E.; Faure, L.; Bronnvik, H.; Scacco, M.; Bassi, E.; Fiedler, W.; Gruebler, M. U.; Hatzl, J.; Jenny, D.; Roverselli, A.; Sumasgutner, P.; Tschumi, M.; Wikelski, M.; Safi, K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556633\nThe heterogeneity of the physical environment determines the cost of transport for animals, shaping their energy landscape. Animals respond to this energy landscape by adjusting their distribution and movement to maximize gains and reduce movement costs. Much of our current knowledge about energy landscape dynamics focuses on factors external to the animal, particularly the spatio-temporal variations of the environment. However, an animal's internal state can significantly impact its ability to perceive and utilize the available energy within the landscape, giving rise to an \"individual energy landscape\". Here we show that an individual's energy landscape varies along the ontogenetic axis. Locomotor and cognitive capabilities of individuals change over time, especially during the early life stages. We investigate the development of the energy landscape during ontogeny in the Central European alpine population of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), a large predator that requires negotiating the physical environment to achieve energy-efficient soaring flight. We constructed weekly energy landscapes using environmental features for 55 juvenile golden eagles and demonstrate that energetic costs of traversing the landscape decreased as the birds aged. In fact, the potentially flyable area within the Alpine region increased 2,170-fold during their first three years of independence. Our work contributes to achieving a predictive understanding of animal movement behaviors by presenting ontogeny as a mechanism shaping the individual energy landscape.\nGestures Of Hunger: Uncovering Intentional Gestural Communication In Free-Ranging Hanuman Langurs\nAuthors: Dasgupta, D.; Banerjee, A.; Dutta, A.; Mitra, S.; Banerjee, D.; Karar, R.; Karmakar, S.; Bhattacharya, A.; Ghosh, S.; Bhattacharjee, P.; Paul, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.552163\nContrary to previous beliefs, intentional gestural communication is not exclusive to the hominoid lineage but is also present in other non-human primates. In this study, we report the presence of intentional gestural communication among free-ranging Hanuman langur troop found in Dakshineswar, West Bengal, India. Based on our observation taken between 2019-2021, we found that these langurs exhibit a food-requesting behaviour wherein they use several gestures to communicate with the humans near them. We observed that these langurs assess the recipient's mental state and persistently check if the signal (food request) has been received, waiting until they receive the desired food item. Our findings are in line with the recent findings of the presence of intentional gestural communication in both catarrhine and platyrrhine lineage. Here, we have identified eight begging gestures used by langurs of all ages, except infants. The most common begging gesture is by holding cloth (BGc), but provocation-initiated begging (BGpi) and begging by embracing legs (BGe) efficiently direct the begging events to its success. The frequency of successful begging events is higher in the evening due to increased human interactions during visiting time slots, especially on religious holidays. Our study suggests that ontogenetic ritualization might be at play here among these troop members as this gestural communication has been learned through imitation and reinforced by the reward of receiving food. Moreover, these successful begging events serve as an effective foraging strategy for urban-adapted langurs, allowing them to acquire high-calorie processed food items within a human-modified urban ecosystem.\nProbucol mitigates high-fat diet-induced cognitive and social impairments through disruption of redox-inflammation association\nAuthors: Wu, H.-M.; Huang, N.-J.; Yang, Y.

However, the direct link between metabolic abnormalities and brain functions during high-fat feeding remains unclear. Here, we show that treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, counteracts the cognitive and social impairments induced by a high-fat diet in mice, while having no effect on mood disorders. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects of probucol do not result from rectifying obesity or restoring glucose and lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by the lack of change in body weight, blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, high-fat feeding led to association among the levels of redox factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, glutathione and malondialdehyde, as well as a significant negative correlation between malondialdehyde levels and behavioral performance. Probucol treatment interrupts these linkages and differentially regulates the proteins for the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in the brain. These findings prompt a reconsideration of the mechanism of action of probucol, as well as the roles of altered metabolic profiles and free radicals in brain function.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)--some of which engage in habitual stone tool use--provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors.

MotivationHere, we sought to solve the problem of identifying the emitter of a specific vocalization during free social interaction of animal models. The use of a miniature microphone carried by the subject and connected to its nasal cavity solved this challenge and allowed for assignment of any vocalization recorded during a social interaction to a specific individual. Moreover, the miniature microphone enabled simultaneous recording of sniffing and vocalization activities of an individual, thus facilitating recognition of the internal states underlying these traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is significant variability in the extent to which individuals from group-living species participate in intergroup competition (IGC) over resources. Such variability may be particularly robust in human-impacted environments, wherein anthropogenic resources may strongly impact intergroup overlap and competition. Examining the socio-ecological causal factors driving these differences can shed new lights on animals costs-benefits trade-offs driving engagement in such interactions. Here we use (peri)urban-dwelling rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as model-systems to examine how individual differences in socio-ecological characteristics (i.e., animals sex, rank, and affiliative connections) may influence propensities to participate in IGC in anthropogenic environments. We found that participation was strongly influenced by individuals affiliative connections. Interestingly, monkeys with more coalitionary support partners had higher IGC participation, but this was more pronounced for individuals that are more peripheral in their proximity and multilayer affiliative networks, compared to more socially central individuals. Moreover, males and low-ranking individuals were more likely to participate in IGC. Our findings suggest that differential access to socio-ecological resources likely drives IGC participation. The evaluation of such inter-individual differences in socio-ecological flexibility and decision-making in dynamic environments is critical for future research related to the links between behavioural ecology, health outcomes, and human-wildlife co-existence in anthropogenic landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social information use and production occur simultaneously during social learning events; however, these two processes are often studied independently. We propose that social information use and production represent a feedback loop: eavesdroppers influence the behaviors of those being observed, which then alters the eavesdroppers social decisions. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the relationship between social information use and production in an aggressive context. We quantified aggressive behavior between two males being observed by either a male, female, or no one. We then measured variation in social information use by allowing the eavesdroppers to interact directly with the observed males and compared their behavior to individuals who did not observe the aggressive encounter. Male eavesdroppers caused the observed males to decrease their aggressive behaviors, thus altering their social information production. Male eavesdroppers were then less likely to attack observed contest winners than males without social information. Female eavesdroppers did not elicit any change in the aggression of the two males, and female eavesdroppers did not use social information to inform their mating decisions. Overall, we found support for the feedback loop in males, but not females: information was exchanged bi-directionally during eavesdropping events, resulting in the modification of behavior by all parties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abstract 1. For many animals, social relationships are a key determinant of fitness. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of the adaptive function, ontogeny, evolution, and mechanistic underpinnings of social relationships. There is a vast and ever-accumulating amount of social behavioural data on individually recognised animals, an incredible resource to shed light onto the biological basis of social relationships. Yet, the full potential of such data lies in comparative research across taxa with distinct life histories and ecologies. Substantial challenges impede systematic comparisons, one of which is the lack of persistent, accessible, and standardised databases. 2. Here, we advocate for the creation of big-team collaborations and comparative databases to unlock the wealth of behavioural data for research on social relationships by introducing MacaqueNet (https://macaquenet.github.io/). 3. As a global collaboration of over 100 researchers, the MacaqueNet database encompasses data from 1981 to the present on 14 species and is the first publicly searchable and standardised database on affiliative and agonistic animal social networks. With substantial inter-specific variation in ecology and social structure and the first published record on macaque behaviour dating back to 1956, macaque research has already contributed to answering fundamental questions on the biological bases and evolution of social relationships. Building on these strong foundations, we believe that MacaqueNet can further promote collaborative and comparative research on social behaviour. 4. We believe that big-team approaches to building standardised databases, bringing together data contributors and researchers, will aid much-needed large-scale comparative research in behavioural ecology and beyond. We describe the establishment of MacaqueNet, from starting a large-scale collective to the creation of a cross-species collaborative database and the implementation of data entry and retrieval protocols. As such, we hope to provide a functional example for future endeavours of large-scale collaborative research into the biology of social behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exploration is a key part of an animal&#39;s ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The heterogeneity of the physical environment determines the cost of transport for animals, shaping their energy landscape. Animals respond to this energy landscape by adjusting their distribution and movement to maximize gains and reduce movement costs. Much of our current knowledge about energy landscape dynamics focuses on factors external to the animal, particularly the spatio-temporal variations of the environment. However, an animal&#39;s internal state can significantly impact its ability to perceive and utilize the available energy within the landscape, giving rise to an &#34;individual energy landscape&#34;. Here we show that an individual&#39;s energy landscape varies along the ontogenetic axis. Locomotor and cognitive capabilities of individuals change over time, especially during the early life stages. We investigate the development of the energy landscape during ontogeny in the Central European alpine population of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), a large predator that requires negotiating the physical environment to achieve energy-efficient soaring flight. We constructed weekly energy landscapes using environmental features for 55 juvenile golden eagles and demonstrate that energetic costs of traversing the landscape decreased as the birds aged. In fact, the potentially flyable area within the Alpine region increased 2,170-fold during their first three years of independence. Our work contributes to achieving a predictive understanding of animal movement behaviors by presenting ontogeny as a mechanism shaping the individual energy landscape.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Contrary to previous beliefs, intentional gestural communication is not exclusive to the hominoid lineage but is also present in other non-human primates. In this study, we report the presence of intentional gestural communication among free-ranging Hanuman langur troop found in Dakshineswar, West Bengal, India. Based on our observation taken between 2019-2021, we found that these langurs exhibit a food-requesting behaviour wherein they use several gestures to communicate with the humans near them. We observed that these langurs assess the recipient&#39;s mental state and persistently check if the signal (food request) has been received, waiting until they receive the desired food item. Our findings are in line with the recent findings of the presence of intentional gestural communication in both catarrhine and platyrrhine lineage. Here, we have identified eight begging gestures used by langurs of all ages, except infants. The most common begging gesture is by holding cloth (BGc), but provocation-initiated begging (BGpi) and begging by embracing legs (BGe) efficiently direct the begging events to its success. The frequency of successful begging events is higher in the evening due to increased human interactions during visiting time slots, especially on religious holidays. Our study suggests that ontogenetic ritualization might be at play here among these troop members as this gestural communication has been learned through imitation and reinforced by the reward of receiving food. Moreover, these successful begging events serve as an effective foraging strategy for urban-adapted langurs, allowing them to acquire high-calorie processed food items within a human-modified urban ecosystem.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity and its detrimental metabolic consequences are commonly recognized as risk factors for impairments in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the direct link between metabolic abnormalities and brain functions during high-fat feeding remains unclear. Here, we show that treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, counteracts the cognitive and social impairments induced by a high-fat diet in mice, while having no effect on mood disorders. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects of probucol do not result from rectifying obesity or restoring glucose and lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by the lack of change in body weight, blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, high-fat feeding led to association among the levels of redox factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, glutathione and malondialdehyde, as well as a significant negative correlation between malondialdehyde levels and behavioral performance. Probucol treatment interrupts these linkages and differentially regulates the proteins for the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in the brain. These findings prompt a reconsideration of the mechanism of action of probucol, as well as the roles of altered metabolic profiles and free radicals in brain function.</p>
