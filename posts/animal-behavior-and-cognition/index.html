S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 131.8, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nFlexibility of tandem leaders resolves traffic jams during colony relocation in an ant\nAuthors: Pathak, M. K.; Annagiri, S.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557616\nAnts, renowned for their intricate social behaviors, exhibit remarkable collective movement patterns that enable them to forage and tunnel efficiently. Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.\nEavesdropping and the audience effect in fighting fruit flies reveal feedback between social information use and production\nAuthors: Hutchins, M.; Saltz, J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555942\nSocial information use and production occur simultaneously during social learning events; however, these two processes are often studied independently. We propose that social information use and production represent a feedback loop: eavesdroppers influence the behaviors of those being observed, which then alters the eavesdroppers social decisions. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the relationship between social information use and production in an aggressive context. We quantified aggressive behavior between two males being observed by either a male, female, or no one. We then measured variation in social information use by allowing the eavesdroppers to interact directly with the observed males and compared their behavior to individuals who did not observe the aggressive encounter. Male eavesdroppers caused the observed males to decrease their aggressive behaviors, thus altering their social information production. Male eavesdroppers were then less likely to attack observed contest winners than males without social information. Female eavesdroppers did not elicit any change in the aggression of the two males, and female eavesdroppers did not use social information to inform their mating decisions. Overall, we found support for the feedback loop in males, but not females: information was exchanged bi-directionally during eavesdropping events, resulting in the modification of behavior by all parties.\nMacaqueNet: big-team research into the biological drivers of social relationships\nAuthors: De Moor, D.; MacaqueNet, ; Skelton, M.; Schulke, O.; Ostner, J.; Neumann, C.; Duboscq, J.; Brent, L. J. N.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.552971\nO_LIFor many animals, social relationships are a key determinant of fitness. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of the adaptive function, ontogeny, evolution, and mechanistic underpinnings of social relationships. There is a vast and ever-accumulating amount of social behavioural data on individually recognised animals, an incredible resource to shed light onto the biological basis of social relationships. Yet, the full potential of such data lies in comparative research across taxa with distinct life histories and ecologies. Substantial challenges impede systematic comparisons, one of which is the lack of persistent, accessible, and standardised databases. C_LIO_LIHere, we advocate for the creation of big-team collaborations and comparative databases to unlock the wealth of behavioural data for research on social relationships by introducing MacaqueNet (https://macaquenet.github.io/). C_LIO_LIAs a global collaboration of over 100 researchers, the MacaqueNet database encompasses data from 1981 to the present on 14 species and is the first publicly searchable and standardised database on affiliative and agonistic animal social networks. With substantial inter-specific variation in ecology and social structure and the first published record on macaque behaviour dating back to 1956, macaque research has already contributed to answering fundamental questions on the biological bases and evolution of social relationships. Building on these strong foundations, we believe that MacaqueNet can further promote collaborative and comparative research on social behaviour. C_LIO_LIWe believe that big-team approaches to building standardised databases, bringing together data contributors and researchers, will aid much-needed large-scale comparative research in behavioural ecology and beyond. We describe the establishment of MacaqueNet, from starting a large-scale collective to the creation of a cross-species collaborative database and the implementation of data entry and retrieval protocols. As such, we hope to provide a functional example for future endeavours of large-scale collaborative research into the biology of social behaviour.

B.; Guo, J.; Suda-Hashimoto, N.; Kaneko, A.; Morimoto, M.; Nishimaru, H.; Setogawa, T.; Go, Y.; Shibata, T.; Nishijo, H.; Takada, M.; Inoue, K.-i.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.556332\nGiven their high sociality and close evolutionary distance to humans, monkeys are an essential animal model for unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying human social behavior and elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases exhibiting abnormal social behavior. However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that utilized multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of various social events. Analyses of social looking facilitated the investigation of adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will significantly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.\nSimultaneous recording of ultrasonic vocalizations and sniffing from socially interacting individual rats using a miniature microphone\nAuthors: John, S. R.; Tiwari, R.; Goussha, Y.; Amar, R.; Bizer, A.; Netser, S.; Wagner, S.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556068\nVocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors. MotivationHere, we sought to solve the problem of identifying the emitter of a specific vocalization during free social interaction of animal models. The use of a miniature microphone carried by the subject and connected to its nasal cavity solved this challenge and allowed for assignment of any vocalization recorded during a social interaction to a specific individual. Moreover, the miniature microphone enabled simultaneous recording of sniffing and vocalization activities of an individual, thus facilitating recognition of the internal states underlying these traits.\nLearning when to learn: hummingbirds adjust their exploration behaviour to match the value of information\nAuthors: Donkersteeg, C.; Peters, H.; Jerome, C.; Menzies, C.; Welch, K. C.; Guillette, L.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556950\nExploration is a key part of an animals ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour. HighlightsO_LIExploration is a necessary part of learning C_LIO_LIForagers must balance sampling for information with the use of known rewards C_LIO_LIHummingbirds learned to explore more when the value of new information was high C_LIO_LIApparent mistakes may actually represent an information-seeking strategy C_LI\nMale-biased stone tool use by wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)\nAuthors: Goldsborough, Z.; Crofoot, M. C.; Barrett, B. J.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556228\nTool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)--some of which engage in habitual stone tool use--provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.\nFinding Drug Repurposing Candidates for Neurodegenerative Diseases using Zebrafish Behavioral Profiles\nAuthors: Hernandez, T. D. R.; Gore, S. V.; Kreiling, J. A.; Creton, R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557235\nDrug repurposing can accelerate drug development while reducing the cost and risk of toxicity typically associated with de novo drug design. Several disorders lacking pharmacological solutions and exhibiting poor results in clinical trials - such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) - could benefit from a cost-effective approach to finding new therapeutics. We previously developed a neural network model, Z-LaP Tracker, capable of quantifying behaviors in zebrafish larvae relevant to cognitive function, including activity, reactivity, swimming patterns, and optomotor response in the presence of visual and acoustic stimuli. Using this model, we performed a high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs to identify compounds that affect zebrafish larval behavior in a manner consistent with the distinct behavior induced by calcineurin inhibitors. Cyclosporine (CsA) and other calcineurin inhibitors have garnered interest for their potential role in the prevention of AD. We generated behavioral profiles suitable for cluster analysis, through which we identified 64 candidate therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.\nHoney bees perform fine-scale detailing that continuously reduces comb area after nest expansion\nAuthors: Bailey, C. S.; Marting, P. R.; Smith, M. L.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557237\nHoney bees are renowned architects. The workers use expensive wax secretions to build their nests, which reach a mature, seemingly steady state, relatively quickly. After nest expansion is complete, workers do not tear down combs completely and begin anew, but there is the possibility they may make subtle changes like adding, removing, and repositioning existing wax. Previous work has focused on nest initiation and nest expansion, but here we focus on mature nests that have reached a steady-state. To investigate subtle changes to comb shape over time, we tracked six colonies from nest initiation through maturity (211 days), photographing their combs every 1-2 weeks. By aligning comb images over time, we show that workers continuously remove wax from the comb edges, thereby reducing total nest area over time. All six colonies trimmed comb edges, and 98.3% of combs were reduced (n = 59). Comb reduction began once workers stopped expanding their nests and continued throughout the experiment. The extent to which a comb was reduced did not correlate with its position within the nest, comb perimeter, or comb area. It is possible that workers use this removed wax as a reserve wax source, though this remains untested. These results show that the superorganism nest is not static; workers are constantly interacting with their nest, and altering it, even after nest expansion is complete.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ants, renowned for their intricate social behaviors, exhibit remarkable collective movement patterns that enable them to forage and tunnel efficiently. Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social information use and production occur simultaneously during social learning events; however, these two processes are often studied independently. We propose that social information use and production represent a feedback loop: eavesdroppers influence the behaviors of those being observed, which then alters the eavesdroppers social decisions. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the relationship between social information use and production in an aggressive context. We quantified aggressive behavior between two males being observed by either a male, female, or no one. We then measured variation in social information use by allowing the eavesdroppers to interact directly with the observed males and compared their behavior to individuals who did not observe the aggressive encounter. Male eavesdroppers caused the observed males to decrease their aggressive behaviors, thus altering their social information production. Male eavesdroppers were then less likely to attack observed contest winners than males without social information. Female eavesdroppers did not elicit any change in the aggression of the two males, and female eavesdroppers did not use social information to inform their mating decisions. Overall, we found support for the feedback loop in males, but not females: information was exchanged bi-directionally during eavesdropping events, resulting in the modification of behavior by all parties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIFor many animals, social relationships are a key determinant of fitness. However, major gaps remain in our understanding of the adaptive function, ontogeny, evolution, and mechanistic underpinnings of social relationships. There is a vast and ever-accumulating amount of social behavioural data on individually recognised animals, an incredible resource to shed light onto the biological basis of social relationships. Yet, the full potential of such data lies in comparative research across taxa with distinct life histories and ecologies. Substantial challenges impede systematic comparisons, one of which is the lack of persistent, accessible, and standardised databases.
C_LIO_LIHere, we advocate for the creation of big-team collaborations and comparative databases to unlock the wealth of behavioural data for research on social relationships by introducing MacaqueNet (https://macaquenet.github.io/).
C_LIO_LIAs a global collaboration of over 100 researchers, the MacaqueNet database encompasses data from 1981 to the present on 14 species and is the first publicly searchable and standardised database on affiliative and agonistic animal social networks. With substantial inter-specific variation in ecology and social structure and the first published record on macaque behaviour dating back to 1956, macaque research has already contributed to answering fundamental questions on the biological bases and evolution of social relationships. Building on these strong foundations, we believe that MacaqueNet can further promote collaborative and comparative research on social behaviour.
C_LIO_LIWe believe that big-team approaches to building standardised databases, bringing together data contributors and researchers, will aid much-needed large-scale comparative research in behavioural ecology and beyond. We describe the establishment of MacaqueNet, from starting a large-scale collective to the creation of a cross-species collaborative database and the implementation of data entry and retrieval protocols. As such, we hope to provide a functional example for future endeavours of large-scale collaborative research into the biology of social behaviour.

        <p class="abstract">Given their high sociality and close evolutionary distance to humans, monkeys are an essential animal model for unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying human social behavior and elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases exhibiting abnormal social behavior. However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that utilized multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of various social events. Analyses of social looking facilitated the investigation of adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will significantly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors.

MotivationHere, we sought to solve the problem of identifying the emitter of a specific vocalization during free social interaction of animal models. The use of a miniature microphone carried by the subject and connected to its nasal cavity solved this challenge and allowed for assignment of any vocalization recorded during a social interaction to a specific individual. Moreover, the miniature microphone enabled simultaneous recording of sniffing and vocalization activities of an individual, thus facilitating recognition of the internal states underlying these traits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exploration is a key part of an animals ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.

        <p class="abstract">Tool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)--some of which engage in habitual stone tool use--provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Drug repurposing can accelerate drug development while reducing the cost and risk of toxicity typically associated with de novo drug design. Several disorders lacking pharmacological solutions and exhibiting poor results in clinical trials - such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) - could benefit from a cost-effective approach to finding new therapeutics. We previously developed a neural network model, Z-LaP Tracker, capable of quantifying behaviors in zebrafish larvae relevant to cognitive function, including activity, reactivity, swimming patterns, and optomotor response in the presence of visual and acoustic stimuli. Using this model, we performed a high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs to identify compounds that affect zebrafish larval behavior in a manner consistent with the distinct behavior induced by calcineurin inhibitors. Cyclosporine (CsA) and other calcineurin inhibitors have garnered interest for their potential role in the prevention of AD. We generated behavioral profiles suitable for cluster analysis, through which we identified 64 candidate therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Honey bees are renowned architects. The workers use expensive wax secretions to build their nests, which reach a mature, seemingly steady state, relatively quickly. After nest expansion is complete, workers do not tear down combs completely and begin anew, but there is the possibility they may make subtle changes like adding, removing, and repositioning existing wax. Previous work has focused on nest initiation and nest expansion, but here we focus on mature nests that have reached a steady-state. To investigate subtle changes to comb shape over time, we tracked six colonies from nest initiation through maturity (211 days), photographing their combs every 1-2 weeks. By aligning comb images over time, we show that workers continuously remove wax from the comb edges, thereby reducing total nest area over time. All six colonies trimmed comb edges, and 98.3% of combs were reduced (n = 59). Comb reduction began once workers stopped expanding their nests and continued throughout the experiment. The extent to which a comb was reduced did not correlate with its position within the nest, comb perimeter, or comb area. It is possible that workers use this removed wax as a reserve wax source, though this remains untested. These results show that the superorganism nest is not static; workers are constantly interacting with their nest, and altering it, even after nest expansion is complete.</p>
