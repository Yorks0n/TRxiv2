S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 95.0, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nMale-biased stone tool use by wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)\nAuthors: Goldsborough, Z.; Crofoot, M. C.; Barrett, B. J.\nScore: 19.1, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.556228\nTool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) -- some of which engage in habitual stone tool use -- provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.\nSimultaneous recording of ultrasonic vocalizations and sniffing from socially interacting individual rats using a miniature microphone\nAuthors: John, S. R.; Tiwari, R.; Goussha, Y.; Amar, R.; Bizer, A.; Netser, S.; Wagner, S.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556068\nVocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors.\nIntragroup sociality drives individual participation in intergroup competition in an urban-dwelling nonhuman primate\nAuthors: Chakraborty, B.; Kaburu, S. S. K.; Balasubramaniam, K. N.; Marty, P. R.; Beisner, B.; Bliss-Moreau, E.; Mohan, L.; Rattan, S. K.; McCowan, B.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556573\nThere is significant variability in the extent to which individuals from group-living species participate in intergroup competition (IGC) over resources. Such variability may be particularly robust in human-impacted environments, wherein anthropogenic resources may strongly impact intergroup overlap and competition. Examining the socio-ecological causal factors driving these differences can shed new lights on animals' costs-benefits trade-offs driving engagement in such interactions. Here we use (peri)urban-dwelling rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as model-systems to examine how individual differences in socio-ecological characteristics (i.e., animals' sex, rank, and affiliative connections) may influence propensities to participate in IGC in anthropogenic environments. We found that participation was strongly influenced by individuals' affiliative connections. Interestingly, monkeys with more coalitionary support partners had higher IGC participation, but this was more pronounced for individuals that are more peripheral in their proximity and multilayer affiliative networks, compared to more socially central individuals. Moreover, males and low-ranking individuals were more likely to participate in IGC. Our findings suggest that differential access to socio-ecological resources likely drives IGC participation. The evaluation of such inter-individual differences in socio-ecological flexibility and decision-making in dynamic environments is critical for future research related to the links between behavioural ecology, health outcomes, and human-wildlife co-existence in anthropogenic landscapes.\nThe Egg-Counter: A novel microfluidic platform for characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying\nAuthors: Banse, S. A.; Jarrett, C. M.; Robinson, K. J.; Blue, B. W.; Shaw, E. L.; Phillips, P. C.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555781\nReproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.\nSocial learning of a challenging two-step action sequence fulfils key criteria of cumulative culture in an insect\nAuthors: Bridges, A. D.; Royka, A.; Wilson, T.; Chittka, L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555358\nCulture in non-human animals refers to behaviour that is socially learned and persists within a population over time. Human culture is notable in that it is cumulative: new innovations have built on previous ones over thousands of years. As a result, what is acquired via social learning often goes far beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover it during their lifetime1-3. To date, no previous study has convincingly demonstrated this phenomenon in a non-human animal. Here, we show that bumblebees can learn from a trained demonstrator to open a novel, 3D-printed two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrators to perform the unrewarded first step of the behaviour without providing a temporary reward linked to this action: the reward then being removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observers learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever having been rewarded after the first step. This suggested that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to \"re-innovate\" via individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure over the course of 12 days. The temporal and spatial distance of the unrewarded first step from the reward appeared to inhibit acquisition of two-step box-opening via individual associative learning, but this limitation was overcome by the presence of a trained conspecific. To our knowledge, these results make bumblebees the first animal to demonstrate the ability to socially learn a behaviour that is beyond their ability to innovate individually. This finding challenges the prevailing opinion of the field, which generally considers cumulative culture, which is built on this capacity, to be unique to humans.\nLearning when to learn: hummingbirds adjust their exploration behaviour to match the value of information\nAuthors: Donkersteeg, C.; Peters, H.; Jerome, C.; Menzies, C.; Welch, K. C.; Guillette, L.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.556950\nExploration is a key part of an animal's ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.\nBenchmarking nearest neighbor retrieval of zebra finch vocalizations across development\nAuthors: Tomka, T.; Hao, X.; Miao, A.; Lee, K.; Basha, M.; Reimann, S.; Zai, A. T.; Hahnloser, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.555475\nVocalizations are highly specialized motor gestures that regulate social interactions. The reliable detection of vocalizations from raw streams of microphone data remains an open problem even in research on widely studied animals such as the zebra finch. A promising method for finding vocal samples from potentially few labelled examples (templates) is nearest neighbor retrieval, but this method has never been extensively tested on vocal segmentation tasks. We retrieve zebra finch vocalizations as neighbors of each other in the sound spectrogram space. Based on merely 50 templates, we find excellent retrieval performance in adults (F1 score of 0.93 {+/-} 0.07) but not in juveniles (F1 score of 0.64 {+/-} 0.18), presumably due to the larger vocal variability of the latter. The performance in juveniles improves when retrieval is based on fixed-size template slices (F1 score of 0.72 {+/-} 0.10) instead of entire templates. Among the several distance metrics we tested such as the cosine and the Euclidean distance, we find that the Spearman distance largely outperforms all others. We release our expert-curated dataset of more than 50000 zebra finch vocal segments, which will enable training of data-hungry machine-learning approaches.\nGestures Of Hunger: Uncovering Intentional Gestural Communication In Free-Ranging Hanuman Langurs\nAuthors: Dasgupta, D.; Banerjee, A.; Dutta, A.; Mitra, S.; Banerjee, D.; Karar, R.; Karmakar, S.; Bhattacharya, A.; Ghosh, S.; Bhattacharjee, P.; Paul, M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.552163\nContrary to previous beliefs, intentional gestural communication is not exclusive to the hominoid lineage but is also present in other non-human primates. In this study, we report the presence of intentional gestural communication among free-ranging Hanuman langur troop found in Dakshineswar, West Bengal, India. Based on our observation taken between 2019-2021, we found that these langurs exhibit a food-requesting behaviour wherein they use several gestures to communicate with the humans near them. We observed that these langurs assess the recipient's mental state and persistently check if the signal (food request) has been received, waiting until they receive the desired food item. Our findings are in line with the recent findings of the presence of intentional gestural communication in both catarrhine and platyrrhine lineage. Here, we have identified eight begging gestures used by langurs of all ages, except infants. The most common begging gesture is by holding cloth (BGc), but provocation-initiated begging (BGpi) and begging by embracing legs (BGe) efficiently direct the begging events to its success. The frequency of successful begging events is higher in the evening due to increased human interactions during visiting time slots, especially on religious holidays. Our study suggests that ontogenetic ritualization might be at play here among these troop members as this gestural communication has been learned through imitation and reinforced by the reward of receiving food. Moreover, these successful begging events serve as an effective foraging strategy for urban-adapted langurs, allowing them to acquire high-calorie processed food items within a human-modified urban ecosystem.\nProbucol mitigates high-fat diet-induced cognitive and social impairments through disruption of redox-inflammation association\nAuthors: Wu, H.-M.; Huang, N.-J.; Yang, Y.

However, the direct link between metabolic abnormalities and brain functions during high-fat feeding remains unclear. Here, we show that treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, counteracts the cognitive and social impairments induced by a high-fat diet in mice, while having no effect on mood disorders. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects of probucol do not result from rectifying obesity or restoring glucose and lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by the lack of change in body weight, blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, high-fat feeding led to association among the levels of redox factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, glutathione and malondialdehyde, as well as a significant negative correlation between malondialdehyde levels and behavioral performance. Probucol treatment interrupts these linkages and differentially regulates the proteins for the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in the brain. These findings prompt a reconsideration of the mechanism of action of probucol, as well as the roles of altered metabolic profiles and free radicals in brain function.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tool-using primates often show sex differences in both the frequency and efficiency of tool use. In species with sex-biased dispersal, such within-group variation likely shapes patterns of cultural transmission of tool-use traditions between groups. On the Panamanian islands of Jicaron and Coiba, a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) -- some of which engage in habitual stone tool use -- provide an opportunity to test hypotheses about why such sex-biases arise. On Jicaron, we have only observed males engaging in stone tool use, whereas on Coiba, both sexes are known to use tools. Using 5 years of camera trap data, we show that this variation reflects a true sex difference in tool use rather than a sampling artefact, and then test hypotheses about the factors driving this pattern. Differences in physical ability or risk-aversion, and competition over access to anvils do not account for the sex-differences in tool-use we observe. Our data show that females are physically capable of stone tool use: females on Coiba and juveniles on Jicaron as small and smaller than adult females regularly engage in tool use. Females also have ample opportunity to use tools: the sexes are equally terrestrial, and competition over anvils is low. Finally, females rarely scrounge on left-over food items either during or after tool-using events, suggesting they are not being provisioned by males. Although it remains unclear why white-faced capuchin females on Jicaron do not use stone-tools, our results illustrate that such sex biases in socially learned behaviors can arise even in the absence of obvious physical, environmental and social constraints. This suggests that a much more nuanced understanding of the differences in social structure, diet and dispersal patterns are needed to explain why sex-biases in tool use arise in some populations but not in others.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalizations are pivotal in mammalian communication, especially in humans. Rodents accordingly rely on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) that reflect their internal state as a primary channel during social interactions. However, attributing vocalizations to specific individuals remains challenging, impeding internal state assessment. Rats emit 50 kHz USVs to indicate positive states and intensify sniffing during alertness and social interactions. Here, we present a method involving a miniature microphone attached to the rat nasal cavity that allows for the capture of both male and female individual rat vocalizations and sniffing patterns during social interactions. We found that while the emission of 50 kHz USVs increases during close interactions, these signals lack specific behavioral associations. Moreover, a novel low-frequency vocalization type marking rat social interactions was uncovered. Finally, different dynamics of sniffing and vocalization activities point to distinct underlying internal states. Thus, our method facilitates the exploration of internal states concurrent with social behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There is significant variability in the extent to which individuals from group-living species participate in intergroup competition (IGC) over resources. Such variability may be particularly robust in human-impacted environments, wherein anthropogenic resources may strongly impact intergroup overlap and competition. Examining the socio-ecological causal factors driving these differences can shed new lights on animals&#39; costs-benefits trade-offs driving engagement in such interactions. Here we use (peri)urban-dwelling rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as model-systems to examine how individual differences in socio-ecological characteristics (i.e., animals&#39; sex, rank, and affiliative connections) may influence propensities to participate in IGC in anthropogenic environments. We found that participation was strongly influenced by individuals&#39; affiliative connections. Interestingly, monkeys with more coalitionary support partners had higher IGC participation, but this was more pronounced for individuals that are more peripheral in their proximity and multilayer affiliative networks, compared to more socially central individuals. Moreover, males and low-ranking individuals were more likely to participate in IGC. Our findings suggest that differential access to socio-ecological resources likely drives IGC participation. The evaluation of such inter-individual differences in socio-ecological flexibility and decision-making in dynamic environments is critical for future research related to the links between behavioural ecology, health outcomes, and human-wildlife co-existence in anthropogenic landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Culture in non-human animals refers to behaviour that is socially learned and persists within a population over time. Human culture is notable in that it is cumulative: new innovations have built on previous ones over thousands of years. As a result, what is acquired via social learning often goes far beyond the capacity of any individual to independently discover it during their lifetime1-3. To date, no previous study has convincingly demonstrated this phenomenon in a non-human animal. Here, we show that bumblebees can learn from a trained demonstrator to open a novel, 3D-printed two-step puzzle box to obtain food rewards, even though they fail to do so independently. Experimenters were unable to train demonstrators to perform the unrewarded first step of the behaviour without providing a temporary reward linked to this action: the reward then being removed during later stages of training. However, a third of naive observers learned to open the two-step box from these demonstrators, without ever having been rewarded after the first step. This suggested that social learning might permit the acquisition of behaviours too complex to &#34;re-innovate&#34; via individual learning. Furthermore, naive bees failed to open the box despite extended exposure over the course of 12 days. The temporal and spatial distance of the unrewarded first step from the reward appeared to inhibit acquisition of two-step box-opening via individual associative learning, but this limitation was overcome by the presence of a trained conspecific. To our knowledge, these results make bumblebees the first animal to demonstrate the ability to socially learn a behaviour that is beyond their ability to innovate individually. This finding challenges the prevailing opinion of the field, which generally considers cumulative culture, which is built on this capacity, to be unique to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exploration is a key part of an animal&#39;s ability to learn. The exploration-exploitation dilemma predicts that individuals should adjust their exploration behaviour according to changes in the value of information. Here, we test this prediction by tracking ruby-throated hummingbirds as they foraged repeatedly from a large array of artificial flowers, wherein 25% of the flowers contained a sucrose reward. Similar to real-world floral dynamics, the reward locations were consistent in the short-term, but varied from day to day. Thus, the value of information about the flower contents would be greatest at the beginning of a daily foraging session, and decay toward the end of each session. We tracked five individual hummingbirds in repeated foraging sessions, comprising more than 3,400 floral probes. We analyzed two metrics of their exploration behaviour: (1) the probability that a bird would shift from probing one flower to another, and (2) the Shannon information entropy of a sequence of flowers probed. We show that initially, the hummingbirds increased their exploration behaviour as time elapsed within a session. As they performed more sessions and learned the rules of the environment, the hummingbirds switched to explore more diverse choices at the beginning of a foraging session, when the value of information was high, and less diverse choices toward the end of a session. Our results suggest that foraging hummingbirds can learn when to learn, highlighting the importance of plasticity in exploration behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocalizations are highly specialized motor gestures that regulate social interactions. The reliable detection of vocalizations from raw streams of microphone data remains an open problem even in research on widely studied animals such as the zebra finch. A promising method for finding vocal samples from potentially few labelled examples (templates) is nearest neighbor retrieval, but this method has never been extensively tested on vocal segmentation tasks. We retrieve zebra finch vocalizations as neighbors of each other in the sound spectrogram space. Based on merely 50 templates, we find excellent retrieval performance in adults (F1 score of 0.93 {&#43;/-} 0.07) but not in juveniles (F1 score of 0.64 {&#43;/-} 0.18), presumably due to the larger vocal variability of the latter. The performance in juveniles improves when retrieval is based on fixed-size template slices (F1 score of 0.72 {&#43;/-} 0.10) instead of entire templates. Among the several distance metrics we tested such as the cosine and the Euclidean distance, we find that the Spearman distance largely outperforms all others. We release our expert-curated dataset of more than 50000 zebra finch vocal segments, which will enable training of data-hungry machine-learning approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Contrary to previous beliefs, intentional gestural communication is not exclusive to the hominoid lineage but is also present in other non-human primates. In this study, we report the presence of intentional gestural communication among free-ranging Hanuman langur troop found in Dakshineswar, West Bengal, India. Based on our observation taken between 2019-2021, we found that these langurs exhibit a food-requesting behaviour wherein they use several gestures to communicate with the humans near them. We observed that these langurs assess the recipient&#39;s mental state and persistently check if the signal (food request) has been received, waiting until they receive the desired food item. Our findings are in line with the recent findings of the presence of intentional gestural communication in both catarrhine and platyrrhine lineage. Here, we have identified eight begging gestures used by langurs of all ages, except infants. The most common begging gesture is by holding cloth (BGc), but provocation-initiated begging (BGpi) and begging by embracing legs (BGe) efficiently direct the begging events to its success. The frequency of successful begging events is higher in the evening due to increased human interactions during visiting time slots, especially on religious holidays. Our study suggests that ontogenetic ritualization might be at play here among these troop members as this gestural communication has been learned through imitation and reinforced by the reward of receiving food. Moreover, these successful begging events serve as an effective foraging strategy for urban-adapted langurs, allowing them to acquire high-calorie processed food items within a human-modified urban ecosystem.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity and its detrimental metabolic consequences are commonly recognized as risk factors for impairments in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the direct link between metabolic abnormalities and brain functions during high-fat feeding remains unclear. Here, we show that treatment with probucol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, counteracts the cognitive and social impairments induced by a high-fat diet in mice, while having no effect on mood disorders. Unexpectedly, the beneficial effects of probucol do not result from rectifying obesity or restoring glucose and lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by the lack of change in body weight, blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels. Interestingly, high-fat feeding led to association among the levels of redox factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, glutathione and malondialdehyde, as well as a significant negative correlation between malondialdehyde levels and behavioral performance. Probucol treatment interrupts these linkages and differentially regulates the proteins for the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species in the brain. These findings prompt a reconsideration of the mechanism of action of probucol, as well as the roles of altered metabolic profiles and free radicals in brain function.</p>
