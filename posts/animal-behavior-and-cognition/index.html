R.; Eggert, A.; Manteuffel, C.; Rault, J.-L.\nScore: 104.5, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.17.533160\nHelping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.\nEnhanced long-term memory and increased mushroom body plasticity in Heliconius butterflies\nAuthors: Young, F. J.; Alcalde, A.; Melo-Florez, L.; Couto, A.; Foley, J.; Monllor, M.; McMillan, W. O.; Montgomery, S. H.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548546\nAs highly labile structures on both individual and evolutionary time-scales, the mushroom bodies, a key site of learning and memory in insects, are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of cognitive variation. We explored the behavioural consequences of mushroom body expansion in Heliconius butterflies, which possess greatly expanded mushroom bodies relative to their closest outgroups. We conducted long-term visual memory assays across three Heliconius and three other Heliconiini species using trained food-colour associations. We confirm robust differences between clades, with Heliconius exhibiting greater fidelity to the trained colour after 8 days without reinforcement compared to other Heliconiini, with further evidence of stable preferences at 13 days. We extended this analysis to consider the plastic response of the mushroom body calyces over this time period, measuring the volume of the mushroom body calyx, and the number of neurons and synapses it contains. We find substantial post-eclosion expansion and synaptic pruning in calyx of Heliconius erato, but not in Dryas iulia. In Heliconius erato, visual associative learning experience specifically is associated with a greater retention of calyceal synapses. At an individual level, fidelity to the trained colour in Heliconius erato was also positively correlated with synapse number. These results point to an enhanced visual long-term memory across Heliconius, facilitated not only by phylogenetic expansion of the mushroom body, but also changes in its developmental response to learning experience. The co-evolution of mushroom body expansion, plasticity and specific behaviours provides an important case study in the evolution of cognition. Significance StatementHow are cognitive differences between species supported by evolutionary changes in the brain? We investigated this question using Heliconius butterflies which have expanded mushroom bodies, a region of the insect brain involved in learning and memory. We show that Heliconius have more stable visual long-term memories and exhibit more substantial age- and experience-related plasticity than a closely related genus with smaller mushroom bodies. Recall accuracy was also predicted by synapse number in Heliconius erato, but not Dryas iulia, suggesting functional importance. These results suggest that increases in the size of specific brain regions and changes in their plastic response to experience may co-evolve to shape the evolution of cognition.\nA densely sampled and richly annotated acoustic dataset from a wild bird population\nAuthors: Merino Recalde, N.; Estandia, A.; Pichot, L.; Vansse, A.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.\nScore: 51.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547484\nWe present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.\nKin-recognition shapes collective behaviors in the cannibalistic nematode Pristionchus pacificus\nAuthors: Hiramatsu, F.; Lightfoot, J. W.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549064\nKin-recognition is observed across diverse species forming an important behavioral adaptation influencing organismal interactions. In most species, proximate level mechanisms are poorly characterized, but in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus molecular components regulating its kin-recognition system have been identified which determine its predatory behaviors. This ability prevents the killing of kin however, its impact on other interactions including collective behaviors is unknown. Utilizing pairwise aggregation assays between distinct strains of P. pacificus, we observed aggregation between kin but not distantly related con-specifics. In these assays, only one strain aggregates with solitary behavior induced in the rival. Abolishing predation through Ppa-nhr-40 mutations results in rival strains successfully aggregating together. Additionally, interactions between P. pacificus populations and Caenorhabditis elegans are dominated by P. pacificus which also disrupts C. elegans aggregation dynamics. Thus, aggregating strains of P. pacificus preferentially group with kin, revealing competition and nepotism as previously unknown components influencing collective behaviors in nematodes.\nContributions of associative and non-associative learning to the dynamics of defensive ethograms\nAuthors: Le, Q.-S. E.; Hereford, D.; Borkar, C. D.; Aldaco, Z.; Klar, J.; Resendez, A.; Fadok, J. P.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547975\nDefensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses are currently unclear given the reductionist behavior elicited by most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. To investigate defensive ethograms more thoroughly, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6J mice to a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm that pairs footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared the paired SCS-footshock group with control groups that either received randomly presented SCS and footshock presentations (unpaired) or received only footshocks during conditioning (shock-only). After conditioning, only the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive flight responses comprised of jumping and darting behavior during the WN period. The unpaired group expressed no cue-induced freezing and significantly less freezing overall. Furthermore, the unpaired group reduced freezing but rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, only the paired group decreased tone-induced freezing. During WN, the paired group rapidly transitioned from escape jumping to freezing and darting. Comparatively, the unpaired and shock-only groups displayed stress-induced tail rattling to SCS, eschewing freezing and jumping. These findings demonstrate that while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, associative pairings are required for robust cue-induced freezing and flight expression.\nDetecting ataxia using automated analysis of motor coordination and balance of mice on the balance beam\nAuthors: Wahl, L.; Kaiser, F. M. P.; Bentvelzen, M. F.; White, J. J.; Schonewille, M.; Badura, A.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547476\nBackgroundThe balance beam assay is a well-known paradigm to assess motor coordination in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. Classically, these experiments have been quantified using manual annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to inter-experimenter variability. MethodsWe present an open-source analysis pipeline that allows for the automated quantification of motor function. Using an established ataxia model, we validated the pipeline by comparing its output to three independent observers. ResultsPcp2-Ppp3r1 mutant animals showed a significant increase in the number of missteps and increased time to traverse the beam. ConclusionWe show that our pipeline can reliably report crossing time, missteps, stops, and falls, thereby offering a high-throughput option with increased inter-experimenter reliability for the analysis of balance beam data. Significance statementThe analysis of mouse behaviour and motor coordination experiments often lacks automation and standardisation and is thus time-consuming and prone to inter-experimenter variability and poor reproducibility. The balance beam assay is a well-established motor coordination paradigm and currently lacks such an automated, standardised analysis platform. We have developed an open-source pipeline that allows for the automated analysis of crossing time, missteps, stops, and falls. Together with a standardised, easy to assemble balance beam setup, our pipeline offers a cost-effective, and high-throughput option to generate and analyse balance beam data with increased inter-experimenter and intra-experimenter reliability.\nInformation-theory analysis of mouse string-pulling agrees with Fitts's Law: Increasing task difficulty engages multiple sensorimotor modalities in a dual oscillator behavior\nAuthors: Whishaw, I.; Sandhu, P.; Miza Agha, B.; Inayat, S.; Singh, S.; Ryait, H. S.; Mohajerani, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548852\nMouse string pulling, in which a mouse reels in a string with hand-over-hand movements, can provide insights into skilled motor behavior, neurological status, and cognitive function. The task involves two oscillatory movements connected by the string. The snout tracks the pendulum movement of the string produced by hand-over-hand pulls and so guides the hands to grasp the string. The present study examines the allocation of time required to pull strings of varying diameter. Movement is also described with end-point measures, string-pulling topography with 2D markerless pose estimates based on transfer learning with deep neural networks, and Mat-lab image-segmentation and heuristic algorithms for object tracking. With reduced string diameter, mice took longer to pull 60cm long strings. They also made more pulling cycles, misses, and mouth engagements, and displayed changes in the amplitude and frequency of pull cycles. The time measures agree with Fitts's law in showing that increased task difficulty slows behavior and engages multiple compensatory sensorimotor modalities. The analysis reveals that time is a valuable resource in skilled motor behavior and information-theory can serve as a measure of its effective use.\nSocial influences on delayed gratification in New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays\nAuthors: Miller, R.; Davies, J.; Schiestl, M.; Garcia-Pelegrin, E.; Gray, R. D.; Taylor, A. H.; Clayton, N. S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549039\nSelf-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the 'rotating-tray' paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non-competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.\nThe dopamine inhibitor GBR12909 improves attention and compulsive behaviour in female rats\nAuthors: Abdulkader, S. P.; Neill, J.; Gigg, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548063\nBackgroundStimulants such as methylphenidate are the first-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A principal mechanism of action for these drugs is to reduce dopamine reuptake in the striatum. However, the ensuing risk of abuse with such stimulants means there is an urgent need for new, low-risk therapeutic agents. GBR12909 is a highly selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor, making it an important experimental tool. Indeed, this drug completed Phase II clinical trials for treatment of cocaine abuse. Understanding such drugs has the potential to expand our understanding of the striatal dopamine contribution to impulsivity, attention and compulsive behaviour and will help the development of novel targeted treatments for ADHD without an abuse risk. AimsThe aim of this work was to examine the role of low doses of GBR12909 on attention, impulsivity and compulsive behaviour as measured by 5C-CPT. Oldhams methods was used to determine the presence of a rate-dependent effect. MethodsFemale Lister hooded rats were trained to criterion in the 5C-CPT (\u003e70% accuracy, \u003c 30% omission and \u003c 40% false alarms). Effects of GBR12909 (0.25-1 mg/kg) were investigated on attention, impulsivity and compulsive behaviour under challenging task conditions. ResultsThe two lowest doses of GBR12909 improved selective attention in a rate-dependent manner while the highest dose of GBR 12909 showed a tendency toward improving compulsive behaviour in a baseline-dependent manner. However, GBR 12909 impaired waiting impulsivity in a baseline-dependent manner. ConclusionsGBR12909 has a clearly beneficial effect on attention and compulsive behaviour in the female rat. These findings support further clinical investigation of GBR-type dopamine uptake blockers or GBR analogues to facilitate the discovery of medications for inattentive ADHD, stimulant abuse, compulsive drug seeking behaviour and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nMethylphenidate alleviates attentional and sensorimotor dysfunction induced by developmental manganese exposure: Assessment of catecholaminergic receptor involvement\nAuthors: Beaudin, S.; Howard, S. L.; Santiago, N.; Strupp, B. J.; Smith, D. R.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546786\nBACKGROUNDEnvironmental manganese (Mn) exposure is associated with impairments in attention and psychomotor function as well as impulsivity/hyperactivity in children and adolescents. We have shown previously that developmental Mn exposure can cause these same areas of dysfunction in a rat model. Although treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) is well documented to lessen impairments in attention, impulse control, and sensorimotor function in children, it is unknown whether this treatment is effective in improving these areas of dysfunction induced by developmental Mn exposure. OBJECTIVESDetermine if oral MPH therapy ameliorates the lasting attention and sensorimotor impairments caused by developmental Mn exposure and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity and MPH effectiveness, if observed. Rats were given 50 mg Mn/kg/d orally over PND 1 - 21 and assessed as adults in a series of attention, impulse control and sensorimotor tasks during chronic oral MPH treatment (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/d), followed by continued behavioral testing in the presence of selective catecholaminergic receptor antagonists (SCH 23390, raclopride, and BRL 44408 s.c.) and MPH treatment, using a quasi-Latin-Square design. RESULTSDevelopmental Mn exposure caused persistent attention and sensorimotor impairments in adult rats. MPH therapy at 0.5 mg/kg/d completely ameliorated the Mninduced attentional dysfunction; notably this benefit was not seen following acute administration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., \u003e8 days) treatment. The Mn-induced sensorimotor dysfunction was also ameliorated by MPH treatment but only at the 3 mg/kg/d MPH dose. Furthermore, selectively antagonizing D1, D2, or 2A receptors had no effect on the Mn-induced attentional deficits, or MPH efficacy to ameliorate those deficits. However, antagonism of D2R attenuated the sensorimotor deficits produced by Mn, whereas the efficacy of MPH to ameliorate those sensorimotor deficits was diminished by D1R antagonism. CONCLUSIONSThese findings demonstrate that MPH treatment is effective in treating the lasting attention and sensorimotor deficits caused by developmental Mn exposure, and they clarify the mechanisms underlying developmental Mn neurotoxicity and MPH efficacy. Given that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings may have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly. HighlightsO_LIExposure to manganese (Mn) in early life causes lasting impairments in attentional and sensorimotor (reaching and grasping) abilities. C_LIO_LIProlonged oral methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin) treatment ameliorates the Mn-induced deficits in attention and sensorimotor function, with the most effective MPH dose varying by domain of behavioral dysfunction. C_LIO_LIThe efficacy of MPH for improving attentional dysfunction was not seen following acute administration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., \u003e8 days) of treatment. C_LIO_LISelective dopamine D1, D2, or noradrenergic 2A receptor antagonists did not alter the Mn-induced attentional dysfunction or the MPH efficacy to ameliorate the attention deficits. However, the D1R and D2R antagonists altered impulse control and sensorimotor (grasping) ability depending on the Mn exposure and MPH dose. C_LIO_LIThese findings have important implications for understanding and treating attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits caused by environmental Mn exposure in childhood. C_LIO_LIGiven that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly.

        <p class="abstract">Helping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As highly labile structures on both individual and evolutionary time-scales, the mushroom bodies, a key site of learning and memory in insects, are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of cognitive variation. We explored the behavioural consequences of mushroom body expansion in Heliconius butterflies, which possess greatly expanded mushroom bodies relative to their closest outgroups. We conducted long-term visual memory assays across three Heliconius and three other Heliconiini species using trained food-colour associations. We confirm robust differences between clades, with Heliconius exhibiting greater fidelity to the trained colour after 8 days without reinforcement compared to other Heliconiini, with further evidence of stable preferences at 13 days. We extended this analysis to consider the plastic response of the mushroom body calyces over this time period, measuring the volume of the mushroom body calyx, and the number of neurons and synapses it contains. We find substantial post-eclosion expansion and synaptic pruning in calyx of Heliconius erato, but not in Dryas iulia. In Heliconius erato, visual associative learning experience specifically is associated with a greater retention of calyceal synapses. At an individual level, fidelity to the trained colour in Heliconius erato was also positively correlated with synapse number. These results point to an enhanced visual long-term memory across Heliconius, facilitated not only by phylogenetic expansion of the mushroom body, but also changes in its developmental response to learning experience. The co-evolution of mushroom body expansion, plasticity and specific behaviours provides an important case study in the evolution of cognition.

Significance StatementHow are cognitive differences between species supported by evolutionary changes in the brain? We investigated this question using Heliconius butterflies which have expanded mushroom bodies, a region of the insect brain involved in learning and memory. We show that Heliconius have more stable visual long-term memories and exhibit more substantial age- and experience-related plasticity than a closely related genus with smaller mushroom bodies. Recall accuracy was also predicted by synapse number in Heliconius erato, but not Dryas iulia, suggesting functional importance. These results suggest that increases in the size of specific brain regions and changes in their plastic response to experience may co-evolve to shape the evolution of cognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Kin-recognition is observed across diverse species forming an important behavioral adaptation influencing organismal interactions. In most species, proximate level mechanisms are poorly characterized, but in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus molecular components regulating its kin-recognition system have been identified which determine its predatory behaviors. This ability prevents the killing of kin however, its impact on other interactions including collective behaviors is unknown. Utilizing pairwise aggregation assays between distinct strains of P. pacificus, we observed aggregation between kin but not distantly related con-specifics. In these assays, only one strain aggregates with solitary behavior induced in the rival. Abolishing predation through Ppa-nhr-40 mutations results in rival strains successfully aggregating together. Additionally, interactions between P. pacificus populations and Caenorhabditis elegans are dominated by P. pacificus which also disrupts C. elegans aggregation dynamics. Thus, aggregating strains of P. pacificus preferentially group with kin, revealing competition and nepotism as previously unknown components influencing collective behaviors in nematodes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses are currently unclear given the reductionist behavior elicited by most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. To investigate defensive ethograms more thoroughly, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6J mice to a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm that pairs footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared the paired SCS-footshock group with control groups that either received randomly presented SCS and footshock presentations (unpaired) or received only footshocks during conditioning (shock-only). After conditioning, only the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive flight responses comprised of jumping and darting behavior during the WN period. The unpaired group expressed no cue-induced freezing and significantly less freezing overall. Furthermore, the unpaired group reduced freezing but rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, only the paired group decreased tone-induced freezing. During WN, the paired group rapidly transitioned from escape jumping to freezing and darting. Comparatively, the unpaired and shock-only groups displayed stress-induced tail rattling to SCS, eschewing freezing and jumping. These findings demonstrate that while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, associative pairings are required for robust cue-induced freezing and flight expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe balance beam assay is a well-known paradigm to assess motor coordination in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. Classically, these experiments have been quantified using manual annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to inter-experimenter variability.

MethodsWe present an open-source analysis pipeline that allows for the automated quantification of motor function. Using an established ataxia model, we validated the pipeline by comparing its output to three independent observers.

ResultsPcp2-Ppp3r1 mutant animals showed a significant increase in the number of missteps and increased time to traverse the beam.

ConclusionWe show that our pipeline can reliably report crossing time, missteps, stops, and falls, thereby offering a high-throughput option with increased inter-experimenter reliability for the analysis of balance beam data.

Significance statementThe analysis of mouse behaviour and motor coordination experiments often lacks automation and standardisation and is thus time-consuming and prone to inter-experimenter variability and poor reproducibility. The balance beam assay is a well-established motor coordination paradigm and currently lacks such an automated, standardised analysis platform. We have developed an open-source pipeline that allows for the automated analysis of crossing time, missteps, stops, and falls. Together with a standardised, easy to assemble balance beam setup, our pipeline offers a cost-effective, and high-throughput option to generate and analyse balance beam data with increased inter-experimenter and intra-experimenter reliability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mouse string pulling, in which a mouse reels in a string with hand-over-hand movements, can provide insights into skilled motor behavior, neurological status, and cognitive function. The task involves two oscillatory movements connected by the string. The snout tracks the pendulum movement of the string produced by hand-over-hand pulls and so guides the hands to grasp the string. The present study examines the allocation of time required to pull strings of varying diameter. Movement is also described with end-point measures, string-pulling topography with 2D markerless pose estimates based on transfer learning with deep neural networks, and Mat-lab image-segmentation and heuristic algorithms for object tracking. With reduced string diameter, mice took longer to pull 60cm long strings. They also made more pulling cycles, misses, and mouth engagements, and displayed changes in the amplitude and frequency of pull cycles. The time measures agree with Fitts&#39;s law in showing that increased task difficulty slows behavior and engages multiple compensatory sensorimotor modalities. The analysis reveals that time is a valuable resource in skilled motor behavior and information-theory can serve as a measure of its effective use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-control underlies goal-directed behaviour in humans and other animals. Delayed gratification - a measure of self-control - requires the ability to tolerate a delay and/or invest more effort to obtain a reward of higher value over one of lower value, such as food or mates. Social context, in particular, the presence of competitors, may influence delayed gratification. We adapted the &#39;rotating-tray&#39; paradigm, where subjects need to forgo an immediate, lower-quality (i.e. less preferred) reward for a delayed, higher-quality (i.e. more preferred) one, to test social influences on delayed gratification in two corvid species: New Caledonian crows and Eurasian jays. We compared choices for immediate vs. delayed rewards while alone, in the presence of a competitive conspecific and in the presence of a non-competitive conspecific. We found that species differed: jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward than the crows. We also found that jays were more likely to select the immediate, less preferred reward when a competitor or non-competitor was present than when alone, or when a competitor was present compared to a non-competitor, while the crows selected the delayed, highly preferred reward irrespective of social presence. We discuss our findings in relation to species differences in socio-ecological factors (adult sociality and food caching) and wider implications of social influences on self-control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundStimulants such as methylphenidate are the first-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A principal mechanism of action for these drugs is to reduce dopamine reuptake in the striatum. However, the ensuing risk of abuse with such stimulants means there is an urgent need for new, low-risk therapeutic agents. GBR12909 is a highly selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor, making it an important experimental tool. Indeed, this drug completed Phase II clinical trials for treatment of cocaine abuse. Understanding such drugs has the potential to expand our understanding of the striatal dopamine contribution to impulsivity, attention and compulsive behaviour and will help the development of novel targeted treatments for ADHD without an abuse risk.

AimsThe aim of this work was to examine the role of low doses of GBR12909 on attention, impulsivity and compulsive behaviour as measured by 5C-CPT. Oldhams methods was used to determine the presence of a rate-dependent effect.

MethodsFemale Lister hooded rats were trained to criterion in the 5C-CPT (&gt;70% accuracy, &lt; 30% omission and &lt; 40% false alarms). Effects of GBR12909 (0.25-1 mg/kg) were investigated on attention, impulsivity and compulsive behaviour under challenging task conditions.

ResultsThe two lowest doses of GBR12909 improved selective attention in a rate-dependent manner while the highest dose of GBR 12909 showed a tendency toward improving compulsive behaviour in a baseline-dependent manner. However, GBR 12909 impaired waiting impulsivity in a baseline-dependent manner.

ConclusionsGBR12909 has a clearly beneficial effect on attention and compulsive behaviour in the female rat. These findings support further clinical investigation of GBR-type dopamine uptake blockers or GBR analogues to facilitate the discovery of medications for inattentive ADHD, stimulant abuse, compulsive drug seeking behaviour and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDEnvironmental manganese (Mn) exposure is associated with impairments in attention and psychomotor function as well as impulsivity/hyperactivity in children and adolescents. We have shown previously that developmental Mn exposure can cause these same areas of dysfunction in a rat model. Although treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) is well documented to lessen impairments in attention, impulse control, and sensorimotor function in children, it is unknown whether this treatment is effective in improving these areas of dysfunction induced by developmental Mn exposure.

OBJECTIVESDetermine if oral MPH therapy ameliorates the lasting attention and sensorimotor impairments caused by developmental Mn exposure and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity and MPH effectiveness, if observed. Rats were given 50 mg Mn/kg/d orally over PND 1 - 21 and assessed as adults in a series of attention, impulse control and sensorimotor tasks during chronic oral MPH treatment (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/d), followed by continued behavioral testing in the presence of selective catecholaminergic receptor antagonists (SCH 23390, raclopride, and BRL 44408 s.c.) and MPH treatment, using a quasi-Latin-Square design.

RESULTSDevelopmental Mn exposure caused persistent attention and sensorimotor impairments in adult rats. MPH therapy at 0.5 mg/kg/d completely ameliorated the Mninduced attentional dysfunction; notably this benefit was not seen following acute administration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., &gt;8 days) treatment. The Mn-induced sensorimotor dysfunction was also ameliorated by MPH treatment but only at the 3 mg/kg/d MPH dose. Furthermore, selectively antagonizing D1, D2, or 2A receptors had no effect on the Mn-induced attentional deficits, or MPH efficacy to ameliorate those deficits. However, antagonism of D2R attenuated the sensorimotor deficits produced by Mn, whereas the efficacy of MPH to ameliorate those sensorimotor deficits was diminished by D1R antagonism.

CONCLUSIONSThese findings demonstrate that MPH treatment is effective in treating the lasting attention and sensorimotor deficits caused by developmental Mn exposure, and they clarify the mechanisms underlying developmental Mn neurotoxicity and MPH efficacy. Given that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings may have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly.

HighlightsO_LIExposure to manganese (Mn) in early life causes lasting impairments in attentional and sensorimotor (reaching and grasping) abilities.
C_LIO_LIProlonged oral methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin) treatment ameliorates the Mn-induced deficits in attention and sensorimotor function, with the most effective MPH dose varying by domain of behavioral dysfunction.
C_LIO_LIThe efficacy of MPH for improving attentional dysfunction was not seen following acute administration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., &gt;8 days) of treatment.
C_LIO_LISelective dopamine D1, D2, or noradrenergic 2A receptor antagonists did not alter the Mn-induced attentional dysfunction or the MPH efficacy to ameliorate the attention deficits. However, the D1R and D2R antagonists altered impulse control and sensorimotor (grasping) ability depending on the Mn exposure and MPH dose.
C_LIO_LIThese findings have important implications for understanding and treating attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits caused by environmental Mn exposure in childhood.
C_LIO_LIGiven that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly.
