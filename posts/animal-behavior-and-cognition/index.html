F.; Goolsby, W. N.; Brooks, K. A.; Rodgers, C. C.\nScore: 21.6, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574475\nHow we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.\nChanges in enclosure use and basking behaviour associated with pair housing in Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko)\nAuthors: Szabo, B.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574605\nDue to often insufficient information reptiles suffer welfare issues and increased mortality in captivity. In particular, the impact of the social environment remains poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting its importance for welfare in a wide range social animals. The current study investigated how pair housing changes enclosure use, basking and hiding behaviour in tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). While the captive conditions and husbandry procedures employed in this study align with existing literature recommendations, they have not been previously evaluated for their suitability for this particular species. The results show that, when socially deprived, lizards were more likely to move and hide before feeding. Furthermore, males were more likely to be found at the front than females during pair housing but not during single housing. Finally, contrary to single housing, enclosure temperature had no effect on the probability to move and hide behind a shelter during pair housing. Consistently, however, lizards were more likely to bask after feeding across housing conditions and females were more likely to bask before their first clutch. Together, pair housing decreases movement and hiding in relation to human presence (feeding) which might indicate that pair housing improves tokay gecko welfare and suggest that the presence of a conspecific should be considered to improve welfare policies in social reptiles. This study serves as a baseline for future research into how enclosure furnishings, husbandry techniques, and enrichment practices impact the welfare of tokay geckos which will be crucial for refining our understanding of and improving on the welfare of reptiles in captivity.\nSubtle, but perceptible, sexual dichromatism and disassortative mating based on plumage reflectance in Black Terns (Chlidonias niger)\nAuthors: Baldassarre, D. T.; Davis, K. M.; Shealer, D. A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575209\nIn birds, sexual selection on plumage often leads to sexual dichromatism and male ornamentation. However, even in drab species with no obvious sexual dichromatism, both sexes may still use plumage for mate choice. A previous study found weak sexual size dimorphism in North American Black Terns (Chlidonias niger surinamensis), but no assortative mating based on morphology. However, the relevance of plumage variation to mate choice is yet untested. Here, using reflectance spectrometry and avian visual modeling revealed that Black Tern males and females exhibited a subtle but significant difference in brightness (males darker). Importantly, the achromatic contrast between the sexes should be perceptible during mate choice. Moreover, there was evidence of disassortative mating for plumage color, but not brightness: more black and saturated birds paired with more gray and unsaturated birds. There was no relationship between plumage color or brightness and body mass. This finding suggests that visual signals unrelated to body condition may be relevant to Black Tern mate choice. The pattern of disassortative mating was unexpected, and potential benefits of choosing a mate dissimilar from oneself are discussed. This study highlights the importance of considering the avian visual system when studying plumage variation elusive to human observers.\nInvariant crossmodal equivalence between objects in rhesus monkeys\nAuthors: Cabrera-Ruiz, E.; Alva, M.; Mata, M.; Trevino, M.; Vergara, J.; Figueroa, T.; Perez-Orive, J.; Lemus, L.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574397\nAfter hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.\nAutomated behavioral analysis reveals that mice employ a bait-and-switch escape mechanism to de-escalate social conflict.\nAuthors: Clein, R.; Warren, M.; Neunuebel, J. P.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575321\nIntraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male's behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nConditioned overconsumption is dependent on reinforcer type in lean, but not obese, mice.\nAuthors: Lewis-Sanders, D.; Bullich, S.; Olvera, M. J.; Vo, J.; Hwang, Y.-S.; Stern, S. A.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573797\nAssociative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.\nThe impact of kinship composition on social structure\nAuthors: Pereira, A. D. S.; Pavez-Fox, M. A.; Hart, J. D. A.; Negron-Del Valle, J. E.; Phillips, D.; Casanova, C.; De Moor, D.; Brent, L. J. N.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575037\nThe relatedness between group members is a potential driver of variation in social structure. Relatedness predicts biases in partner choice and formation of strong relationships among group members. As such, groups that differ in their percentage of non-kin dyads, i.e., in their kinship composition, should therefore differ in the structure of their social networks. Yet the relationship between kinship composition and social structure remains unclear. Here, we used long-term social and pedigree data from a population of rhesus macaques to investigate the relationship between kinship composition and the connectivity, cohesion, potential for transmission and social differentiation of the social networks of adult female macaques. We found no evidence that the social structure of groups composed of greater proportion of unrelated females differ from that of groups with a lower proportion of non-kin. To investigate this unexpected finding, we built agent-based models parameterised with the empirical data to further explore (1) the expected relationship between kinship composition and social structure and (2) why we did not find such a relationship in the empirical data. Agent-based models showed that kinship composition can influence social structure in populations similar to the one studied, but that this effect may only be detectable with a sample size even larger than ours (19 group-years) and with greater variance in kinship composition (proportion of non-kin varied between 0.830-0.922 in the empirical data). The relationship between kinship composition and social structure might be more apparent when comparing data from species that differ strongly in their social organisation, translating into marked differences in kinship composition. This further emphasises the importance of reporting existing and future kinship composition data to deepen our understanding of the evolution of sociality and highlights the potential of agent-based models to better understand empirical results.\nA bibliometric analysis of neurobiological and behavioraldisturbances of cafeteria diet interventions\nAuthors: Lopez-Castro, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574927\nObesity is a global epidemic mainly caused by the overconsumption of western diets, high in fat and sugars. Cafeteria diet administered to rodents is an effective model of the metabolic, neurobiological, and behavioral disturbances caused by the over consumption of western diet in humans. However, this is still an emerging research field. To provide information about the past, present and future of the research field, this study aims to explore the research field of cafeteria diet and behavior through bibliometric analysis. Original articles on cafeteria diet and behavior were obtained from Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2013 to Octuber 30, 2023. The R packages litsearchr, bibliometrix, sjrdata and mblm were used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Linear regression, concept mapping and trend analysis were used for relationship analysis. 85 articles included from 457 authors, 20 countries and 56 institutions were included. 46 from Pubmed, 12 from Scopus and 27 from Web of Science. The 25 topmost productive authors were from Spain, Brazil, Australia, Switzerland, and USA. 15 authors had an h-index higher than 3. The institution with the largest production of articles is the University of South Wales with 10 articles. A simple linear regression could not establish significance between the relationship between the impact factor and the number of citations received. In addition, a conceptual structure map was performed, and 5 clusters were found. Finally, by a bi-factor analysis, a trend topic established that anxiety is the term currently in trend and since 2017 in the cafeteria diet and behavior research field. The present study explores the performance of authors, countries, institutions, and journals on classical measures of scientific parameters. This helped to model multiple correspondence and trend analyses that provide a reliable source of information to direct research on cafeteria diet interventions.\nMind the instructions: reward cues are liked first, wanted later\nAuthors: Prutean, N.; Vermeylen, L.; Kukkonen, N.; Steendam, T. S.; Eayrs, J. O.; Krebs, R. M.; Wiersema, J. R.; Vassena, E.; Boehler, N. C.; Notebaert, W.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574803\nCurrent theories propose that mental effort is invested only when the anticipated benefits, such as rewards, outweigh the associated costs, like task difficulty. Yet, it remains unclear whether this motivational and mitigating aspect of reward processing is reflected in the evaluation of reward/difficulty cues as such, and to what extent it depends on task experience. In a pre-registered experiment (N=84), we used the affect misattribution procedure (AMP) to gauge affective evaluations of nonword cues predicting reward and task difficulty levels. Contrary to previous studies, the AMP was administered at the outset, after cue instructions, and after the cues were used in a random dot motion (RDM) task. Compared to baseline, cues predicting a larger reward were evaluated more positively after RDM task experience, and most importantly, already after cue instructions, with no difference between the two phases. This evaluative effect manifested in increased performance after larger reward cues in the RDM task. Our results suggest that AMP effects may generally capture performance expectations which are independent of task experience. Importantly, these instructed expectations of reward and difficulty play a crucial role in the evaluation and subsequent investment of mental effort.\n",

        <p class="abstract">How we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to often insufficient information reptiles suffer welfare issues and increased mortality in captivity. In particular, the impact of the social environment remains poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting its importance for welfare in a wide range social animals. The current study investigated how pair housing changes enclosure use, basking and hiding behaviour in tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). While the captive conditions and husbandry procedures employed in this study align with existing literature recommendations, they have not been previously evaluated for their suitability for this particular species. The results show that, when socially deprived, lizards were more likely to move and hide before feeding. Furthermore, males were more likely to be found at the front than females during pair housing but not during single housing. Finally, contrary to single housing, enclosure temperature had no effect on the probability to move and hide behind a shelter during pair housing. Consistently, however, lizards were more likely to bask after feeding across housing conditions and females were more likely to bask before their first clutch. Together, pair housing decreases movement and hiding in relation to human presence (feeding) which might indicate that pair housing improves tokay gecko welfare and suggest that the presence of a conspecific should be considered to improve welfare policies in social reptiles. This study serves as a baseline for future research into how enclosure furnishings, husbandry techniques, and enrichment practices impact the welfare of tokay geckos which will be crucial for refining our understanding of and improving on the welfare of reptiles in captivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In birds, sexual selection on plumage often leads to sexual dichromatism and male ornamentation. However, even in drab species with no obvious sexual dichromatism, both sexes may still use plumage for mate choice. A previous study found weak sexual size dimorphism in North American Black Terns (Chlidonias niger surinamensis), but no assortative mating based on morphology. However, the relevance of plumage variation to mate choice is yet untested. Here, using reflectance spectrometry and avian visual modeling revealed that Black Tern males and females exhibited a subtle but significant difference in brightness (males darker). Importantly, the achromatic contrast between the sexes should be perceptible during mate choice. Moreover, there was evidence of disassortative mating for plumage color, but not brightness: more black and saturated birds paired with more gray and unsaturated birds. There was no relationship between plumage color or brightness and body mass. This finding suggests that visual signals unrelated to body condition may be relevant to Black Tern mate choice. The pattern of disassortative mating was unexpected, and potential benefits of choosing a mate dissimilar from oneself are discussed. This study highlights the importance of considering the avian visual system when studying plumage variation elusive to human observers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male&#39;s behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Associative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relatedness between group members is a potential driver of variation in social structure. Relatedness predicts biases in partner choice and formation of strong relationships among group members. As such, groups that differ in their percentage of non-kin dyads, i.e., in their kinship composition, should therefore differ in the structure of their social networks. Yet the relationship between kinship composition and social structure remains unclear. Here, we used long-term social and pedigree data from a population of rhesus macaques to investigate the relationship between kinship composition and the connectivity, cohesion, potential for transmission and social differentiation of the social networks of adult female macaques. We found no evidence that the social structure of groups composed of greater proportion of unrelated females differ from that of groups with a lower proportion of non-kin. To investigate this unexpected finding, we built agent-based models parameterised with the empirical data to further explore (1) the expected relationship between kinship composition and social structure and (2) why we did not find such a relationship in the empirical data. Agent-based models showed that kinship composition can influence social structure in populations similar to the one studied, but that this effect may only be detectable with a sample size even larger than ours (19 group-years) and with greater variance in kinship composition (proportion of non-kin varied between 0.830-0.922 in the empirical data). The relationship between kinship composition and social structure might be more apparent when comparing data from species that differ strongly in their social organisation, translating into marked differences in kinship composition. This further emphasises the importance of reporting existing and future kinship composition data to deepen our understanding of the evolution of sociality and highlights the potential of agent-based models to better understand empirical results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a global epidemic mainly caused by the overconsumption of western diets, high in fat and sugars. Cafeteria diet administered to rodents is an effective model of the metabolic, neurobiological, and behavioral disturbances caused by the over consumption of western diet in humans. However, this is still an emerging research field. To provide information about the past, present and future of the research field, this study aims to explore the research field of cafeteria diet and behavior through bibliometric analysis. Original articles on cafeteria diet and behavior were obtained from Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2013 to Octuber 30, 2023. The R packages litsearchr, bibliometrix, sjrdata and mblm were used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Linear regression, concept mapping and trend analysis were used for relationship analysis. 85 articles included from 457 authors, 20 countries and 56 institutions were included. 46 from Pubmed, 12 from Scopus and 27 from Web of Science. The 25 topmost productive authors were from Spain, Brazil, Australia, Switzerland, and USA. 15 authors had an h-index higher than 3. The institution with the largest production of articles is the University of South Wales with 10 articles. A simple linear regression could not establish significance between the relationship between the impact factor and the number of citations received. In addition, a conceptual structure map was performed, and 5 clusters were found. Finally, by a bi-factor analysis, a trend topic established that anxiety is the term currently in trend and since 2017 in the cafeteria diet and behavior research field. The present study explores the performance of authors, countries, institutions, and journals on classical measures of scientific parameters. This helped to model multiple correspondence and trend analyses that provide a reliable source of information to direct research on cafeteria diet interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Current theories propose that mental effort is invested only when the anticipated benefits, such as rewards, outweigh the associated costs, like task difficulty. Yet, it remains unclear whether this motivational and mitigating aspect of reward processing is reflected in the evaluation of reward/difficulty cues as such, and to what extent it depends on task experience. In a pre-registered experiment (N=84), we used the affect misattribution procedure (AMP) to gauge affective evaluations of nonword cues predicting reward and task difficulty levels. Contrary to previous studies, the AMP was administered at the outset, after cue instructions, and after the cues were used in a random dot motion (RDM) task. Compared to baseline, cues predicting a larger reward were evaluated more positively after RDM task experience, and most importantly, already after cue instructions, with no difference between the two phases. This evaluative effect manifested in increased performance after larger reward cues in the RDM task. Our results suggest that AMP effects may generally capture performance expectations which are independent of task experience. Importantly, these instructed expectations of reward and difficulty play a crucial role in the evaluation and subsequent investment of mental effort.</p>
