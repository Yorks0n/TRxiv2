D.; Cheng, Y.\nScore: 47.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567545\nIndividual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.\nPrimate origins of human event cognition\nAuthors: Wilson, V. A. D.; Sauppe, S.; Brocard, S.; Ringen, E. J.; Daum, M. M.; Wermelinger, S.; Gu, N.; Andrews, C.; Isasi-Isasmendi, A.; Bickel, B.; Zuberbuehler, K.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568086\nHuman language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available. Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.\nWind Gates Search States in Free Flight\nAuthors: Stupski, S. D.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569086\nFor any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise \"virtual\" olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped \"sink and circle\" search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and \"anemometric\" turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.\nThe demographic drivers of cultural evolution in bird song: a multilevel study\nAuthors: Recalde, N. M.; Estandia, A.; Keen, S. C.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.\nScore: 24.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452\nSocial learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from \u003e400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.\nThe demographic drivers of cultural evolution in bird song: a multilevel study\nAuthors: Recalde, N.

During these behaviours, sperm whales communicate primarily using sequences of short bursts of clicks with varying inter-click intervals, known as codas. Past research has identified around 150 discrete coda types globally, with 21 in the Caribbean. A subset of these have been shown to encode information about caller and clan identity. However, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown. In this study, we show that codas exhibit contextual and combinatorial structure with key similarities to aspects of human language and other primate communication systems. First, we report previously undescribed variations in coda structure that are sensitive to the conversational context in which they occur. We call these rubato and ornamentation, by analogy to musical terminology. These variations are systematically controlled and imitated across individual whales. Second, we show that coda types are not defined by arbitrary sequences of inter-click intervals, but instead form a combinatorial coding system in which rubato and ornamentation combine with two categorical, context-independent features that we call rhythm and tempo to give rise to a large inventory of distinguishable codas. In a dataset of 8,719 codas from the sperm whales of the Eastern Caribbean clan, this 'sperm whale phonetic alphabet' makes it possible to systematically explain observed variability in coda structure. Sperm whale vocalisations are more expressive and structured than previously believed, and are built from a repertoire comprising nearly an order of magnitude more distinguishable codas. These results show context-sensitive and combinatorial vocalisation systems extend beyond humans, and can appear in an organism with a divergent evolutionary lineage and vocal apparatus.\nNon-instructed Motor Skill Learning in Monkeys: Insights from Deep Reinforcement Learning Models\nAuthors: Carminatti, L.; Condro, L.; Riehle, A.; Grün, S.; Brochier, T.; Dauce, E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569889\nIn the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: \"Time\" reflecting the time spent to perfom a trial, and \"Power\" integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of \"path selection\", that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (\"Time\") and minimizing its metabolic cost (\"Power\"), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play. Author summaryThe way in which animals and humans learn new motor skills through free exploratory movements sequences solely governed by success or failure outcomes is not yet fully understood. Recent advances in machine learning techniques for continuous action spaces led us to construct a motor learning model investigate how animals progressively enhance the efficiency of their behaviors through numerous trials and errors. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison between deep learning models and experimental data from monkey behavior. Notably, we show that the progressive refinement of motor sequences, as they are observed in the animals, do not require the implementation of a complete model of their environment. Rather, it merely requires the capacity to anticipate both movement costs and final reward a few steps ahead in the future following a value iteration principle. Furthermore, the systematic deviations exhibited by the monkeys with respect to the computational model inform us on the presence of individual preferences in either minimizing the duration or the energy consumption, and also on the involvement of alternative \"cognitive\" strategies.\nDoes Zipf's law of abbreviation shape birdsong?\nAuthors: Gilman, R. T.; Durrant, C.; Malpas, L.; Lewis, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.569773\nZipfs law of abbreviation predicts that in human languages, words that are used more frequently will be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This has been attributed to the principle of least effort - communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipfs law of abbreviation appears to hold for all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds for animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are less frequently used. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this analysis. We used ZLAvian to study Zipfs law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found weak trends consistent with Zipfs law of abbreviation in 10 of the 11 populations. Across all populations, the negative correlation between phrase length and frequency of use was several times weaker than the negative correlation between word length and frequency of use in human languages. This suggests that the mechanisms that underlie this correlation may be different in birdsong and human language.\nAdaptive algorithms for shaping behavior\nAuthors: Tong, W. L.; Iyer, A.; Murthy, V. N.; Reddy, G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569774\nDogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks ( shaping). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a machine learning framework for shaping animal behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its students task based on the students transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using autonomous teachers that plan a curriculum in a common sequence learning task, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks to carefully balance reinforcement and extinction. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on the sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping animal behavior.\nDo electromagnetic fields from subsea power cables effect elasmobranch behaviour? A risk-based approach for the Dutch Continental Shelf\nAuthors: Hermans, A.; Winter, H. V.; Gill, A. B.; Murk, A. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569531\nSubsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 {micro}T) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the  interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise &#34;virtual&#34; olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped &#34;sink and circle&#34; search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and &#34;anemometric&#34; turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from &gt;400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are long-lived and highly social mammals that engage in complex group behaviours, including navigation, foraging, and child-rearing. During these behaviours, sperm whales communicate primarily using sequences of short bursts of clicks with varying inter-click intervals, known as codas. Past research has identified around 150 discrete coda types globally, with 21 in the Caribbean. A subset of these have been shown to encode information about caller and clan identity. However, almost everything else about the sperm whale communication system, including basic questions about its structure and information-carrying capacity, remains unknown. In this study, we show that codas exhibit contextual and combinatorial structure with key similarities to aspects of human language and other primate communication systems. First, we report previously undescribed variations in coda structure that are sensitive to the conversational context in which they occur. We call these rubato and ornamentation, by analogy to musical terminology. These variations are systematically controlled and imitated across individual whales. Second, we show that coda types are not defined by arbitrary sequences of inter-click intervals, but instead form a combinatorial coding system in which rubato and ornamentation combine with two categorical, context-independent features that we call rhythm and tempo to give rise to a large inventory of distinguishable codas. In a dataset of 8,719 codas from the sperm whales of the Eastern Caribbean clan, this &#39;sperm whale phonetic alphabet&#39; makes it possible to systematically explain observed variability in coda structure. Sperm whale vocalisations are more expressive and structured than previously believed, and are built from a repertoire comprising nearly an order of magnitude more distinguishable codas. These results show context-sensitive and combinatorial vocalisation systems extend beyond humans, and can appear in an organism with a divergent evolutionary lineage and vocal apparatus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: &#34;Time&#34; reflecting the time spent to perfom a trial, and &#34;Power&#34; integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of &#34;path selection&#34;, that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (&#34;Time&#34;) and minimizing its metabolic cost (&#34;Power&#34;), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play.

Author summaryThe way in which animals and humans learn new motor skills through free exploratory movements sequences solely governed by success or failure outcomes is not yet fully understood. Recent advances in machine learning techniques for continuous action spaces led us to construct a motor learning model investigate how animals progressively enhance the efficiency of their behaviors through numerous trials and errors. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison between deep learning models and experimental data from monkey behavior. Notably, we show that the progressive refinement of motor sequences, as they are observed in the animals, do not require the implementation of a complete model of their environment. Rather, it merely requires the capacity to anticipate both movement costs and final reward a few steps ahead in the future following a value iteration principle. Furthermore, the systematic deviations exhibited by the monkeys with respect to the computational model inform us on the presence of individual preferences in either minimizing the duration or the energy consumption, and also on the involvement of alternative &#34;cognitive&#34; strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zipfs law of abbreviation predicts that in human languages, words that are used more frequently will be shorter than words that are used less frequently. This has been attributed to the principle of least effort - communication is more efficient when words that are used more frequently are easier to produce. Zipfs law of abbreviation appears to hold for all human languages, and recently attention has turned to whether it also holds for animal communication. In birdsong, which has been used as a model for human language learning and development, researchers have focused on whether more frequently used notes or phrases are shorter than those that are less frequently used. Because birdsong can be highly stereotyped, have high interindividual variation, and have phrase repertoires that are small relative to human language lexicons, studying Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong presents challenges that do not arise when studying human languages. In this paper, we describe a new method for assessing evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in birdsong, and we introduce the R package ZLAvian to implement this analysis. We used ZLAvian to study Zipfs law of abbreviation in the songs of 11 bird populations archived in the open-access repository Bird-DB. We did not find strong evidence for Zipfs law of abbreviation in any population when studied alone, but we found weak trends consistent with Zipfs law of abbreviation in 10 of the 11 populations. Across all populations, the negative correlation between phrase length and frequency of use was several times weaker than the negative correlation between word length and frequency of use in human languages. This suggests that the mechanisms that underlie this correlation may be different in birdsong and human language.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks ( shaping). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a machine learning framework for shaping animal behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its students task based on the students transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using autonomous teachers that plan a curriculum in a common sequence learning task, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks to carefully balance reinforcement and extinction. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on the sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping animal behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Subsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 {micro}T) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.</p>
