A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.\nFARESHARE: An Open-source Apparatus for Assessing Drinking Microstructure in Socially Housed Rats\nAuthors: Frie, J. A.; Khokhar, J. Y.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561248\nSocial factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.\nLearning modifies attention during bumblebee visual search\nAuthors: Robert, T.; Tarapata, K.; Nityananda, V.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561037\nThe role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher-or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward. Significance StatementStudies investigating how foraging bees learn about reward typically focus on the choices made by the bees. How bees deploy attention and visual search during foraging is less well studied. We analysed flight videos to characterise visual search as bees learn which flowers are rewarding. We found that learning increases the focus of bees on flower regions. We also found that the quality of the reward a flower offers influences how much bees search in non-flower areas. This means that a flower with lower reward attracts less focussed foraging compared to one with a higher reward. Since flowers do differ in floral reward, this has important implications for how focussed pollinators will be on different flowers. Our approach of looking at search behaviour and attention thus advances our understanding of the cognitive ecology of pollination.\nAcute exposure to caffeine improves navigation in an invasive ant\nAuthors: Galante, H.; De Agro, M.; Koch, A.; Kau, S.; Czaczkes, T. J.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561519\nInvasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the reward's location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants' homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ant's ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.\nThe impact of prenatal alcohol and synthetic cannabinoid exposure on behavioral adaptations in adolescent offspring and alcohol self-administration in adulthood\nAuthors: Ornelas, L. C.; Fish, E. W.; Dooley, J. C.; Carroll, M. C.; Parnell, S. E.; Besheer, J.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561571\nPrenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol + CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.\nDelay of punishment highlights differential vulnerability to developing addiction-like behavior toward sweet food\nAuthors: Solinas, M.; Lardeux, V.; LeBlanc, P.-M.; Longueville, J.-E.; Thiriet, N.; Vandaele, Y.; Panlilio, L. V.; Jaafari, N.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.559890\nResistance to punishment is commonly used as a measure of compulsive behavior in addiction-related processes. We recently developed a progressive shock strength (PSS) procedure in which individual rats can titrate the amount of punishment that they are willing to tolerate to obtain food rewards. Here, we investigated the effects of a range of delays (0-12 sec) on resistance to punishment measured by PSS break points. As expected from delay discounting principles, we found that delayed shock was less effective as a punisher, as revealed by higher PSS breakpoints. However, this discounting effect was not equally distributed in the population of rats, and the introduction of a delay highlighted the existence of two populations: rats that were sensitive to immediate punishment were also weakly sensitive to delay, whereas rats that were resistant to immediate punishment showed strong temporal discounting of delayed punishment. Importantly, shock-sensitive rats suppressed responding even in non-punishment sessions, and they differed from shock-resistant rats in anxiety- like behavior but not in sensitivity to pain. These results show that manipulation of temporal contingencies of punishment in the PSS procedure provides a valuable tool to identify individuals with a double vulnerability to addiction: low sensitivity to aversion and excessive discounting of negative future consequences. Conversely, the shock-sensitive population may provide a model of humans who are vulnerable to opportunity loss due to excessive anxiety.\nSocial bond dynamics and the evolution of helping\nAuthors: Leimar, O.; Bshary, R.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561838\nEmpiricists often struggle to apply game theory models to real-life cases of animal cooperation. One reason is that many examples of cooperation occur in stable groups, where costs and benefits of helping depend on several factors. Among these are variable investments, fitness interdependencies, learning, memory, reciprocity, and partner choice, including the formation of social bonds with specific group members. Here, we present a game theory model exploring the conditions under which social bonds between group members can promote cooperation, with reciprocal acts of helping. In the model, bonds build up from exchanges of help in a similar way as the strength of association increases in learning, as in the Rescorla-Wagner rule. The bonds in turn affect partner choice and influence helping amounts. The model has a mechanism of reciprocity for bonded pairs, which can evolve towards either loose or strict reciprocation. Several aspects of the model are inspired by observations of food sharing in vampire bats. We find that small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping, either as small group sizes, or if members of larger groups can form temporary (daily) smaller groupings. The evolutionary outcome is a fairly low cost helping, while the benefit of receiving help can be substantial. Individuals in need request help based on bond strength, but there is also an evolved preference for initiating bonds with new group members. In contrast, if different groups come into temporary contact with each other, the evolved tendency is to avoid forming bonds between groups.\nSeparate orexigenic hippocampal ensembles shape dietary choice by enhancing contextual memory and motivation\nAuthors: Yang, M.; Singh, A.; McDougle, M. J.; Decarie-Spain, L.; Kanoski, S.; de Lartigue, G.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561580\nThe hippocampus (HPC), traditionally known for its role in learning and memory, has emerged as a controller of food intake. While prior studies primarily associated the HPC with food intake inhibition, recent research suggests a critical role in appetitive processes. We hypothesized that orexigenic HPC neurons differentially respond to fats and/or sugars, potent natural reinforcers that contribute to obesity development. Results uncover previously-unrecognized, spatially-distinct neuronal ensembles within the dorsal HPC (dHPC) that are responsive to separate nutrient signals originating from the gut. Using activity-dependent genetic capture of nutrient-responsive HPC neurons, we demonstrate a causal role of both populations in promoting nutrient-specific preference through different mechanisms. Sugar-responsive neurons encode an appetitive spatial memory engram for meal location, whereas fat-responsive neurons selectively enhance the preference and motivation for fat intake. Collectively, these findings uncover a neural basis for the exquisite specificity in processing macronutrient signals from a meal that shape dietary choices.\nExamining infantile facial features and their influence on caretaking behaviors in free-ranging Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)\nAuthors: Minami, T.; Furuichi, T.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562000\nFacial features of immature individuals play a pivotal role in eliciting caretaking behaviors in humans. It has been posited that non-human animals share particular infantile facial features with humans, which can elicit caregivers attention and caretaking behaviors. Nevertheless, the empirical examination of this hypothesis is extremely limited. In this study, we investigated infantile facial features in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), their developmental processes, and their correlation with caretaking and infant behaviors, based on 470 facial photographs from one free-ranging group. We measured the size of facial parts and evaluated infantile facial features in Japanese macaques with non-contact procedures with the animals. The results indicated that, although some partial species differences were observed, the infantile facial features in Japanese macaques were broadly consistent with those previously observed in humans and great apes. Furthermore, half of the infant subjects displayed non-linear developmental trajectories of infantile faces similar to those suggested in humans. These changes were sex-based, with most females demonstrating a linear trajectory and most males a hump-shaped development in their facial proportions. However, unlike previous studies in humans, infantile faces were not significantly associated with maternal or non-maternal caretaking behaviors, nor were their developmental changes correlated with infant behavioral development. These findings indicate that while many aspects of infantile facial features are shared among particular primates, humans may have evolved a uniquely elevated preference for selecting such features among the primate lineage.\nAcute avoidance of hydrogen sulfide is modulated by external and internal states in C. elegans\nAuthors: Pu, L.; Zhao, L.; Wang, J.; Henriksson, J.; Laurent, P.; Chen, C.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561535\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Emotion-like states in animals are commonly assessed using judgment bias tests, which measure responses to ambiguous information. A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher-or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward.

Significance StatementStudies investigating how foraging bees learn about reward typically focus on the choices made by the bees. How bees deploy attention and visual search during foraging is less well studied. We analysed flight videos to characterise visual search as bees learn which flowers are rewarding. We found that learning increases the focus of bees on flower regions. We also found that the quality of the reward a flower offers influences how much bees search in non-flower areas. This means that a flower with lower reward attracts less focussed foraging compared to one with a higher reward. Since flowers do differ in floral reward, this has important implications for how focussed pollinators will be on different flowers. Our approach of looking at search behaviour and attention thus advances our understanding of the cognitive ecology of pollination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the reward&#39;s location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants&#39; homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ant&#39;s ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol &#43; CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resistance to punishment is commonly used as a measure of compulsive behavior in addiction-related processes. We recently developed a progressive shock strength (PSS) procedure in which individual rats can titrate the amount of punishment that they are willing to tolerate to obtain food rewards. Here, we investigated the effects of a range of delays (0-12 sec) on resistance to punishment measured by PSS break points. As expected from delay discounting principles, we found that delayed shock was less effective as a punisher, as revealed by higher PSS breakpoints. However, this discounting effect was not equally distributed in the population of rats, and the introduction of a delay highlighted the existence of two populations: rats that were sensitive to immediate punishment were also weakly sensitive to delay, whereas rats that were resistant to immediate punishment showed strong temporal discounting of delayed punishment. Importantly, shock-sensitive rats suppressed responding even in non-punishment sessions, and they differed from shock-resistant rats in anxiety- like behavior but not in sensitivity to pain. These results show that manipulation of temporal contingencies of punishment in the PSS procedure provides a valuable tool to identify individuals with a double vulnerability to addiction: low sensitivity to aversion and excessive discounting of negative future consequences. Conversely, the shock-sensitive population may provide a model of humans who are vulnerable to opportunity loss due to excessive anxiety.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Empiricists often struggle to apply game theory models to real-life cases of animal cooperation. One reason is that many examples of cooperation occur in stable groups, where costs and benefits of helping depend on several factors. Among these are variable investments, fitness interdependencies, learning, memory, reciprocity, and partner choice, including the formation of social bonds with specific group members. Here, we present a game theory model exploring the conditions under which social bonds between group members can promote cooperation, with reciprocal acts of helping. In the model, bonds build up from exchanges of help in a similar way as the strength of association increases in learning, as in the Rescorla-Wagner rule. The bonds in turn affect partner choice and influence helping amounts. The model has a mechanism of reciprocity for bonded pairs, which can evolve towards either loose or strict reciprocation. Several aspects of the model are inspired by observations of food sharing in vampire bats. We find that small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping, either as small group sizes, or if members of larger groups can form temporary (daily) smaller groupings. The evolutionary outcome is a fairly low cost helping, while the benefit of receiving help can be substantial. Individuals in need request help based on bond strength, but there is also an evolved preference for initiating bonds with new group members. In contrast, if different groups come into temporary contact with each other, the evolved tendency is to avoid forming bonds between groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The hippocampus (HPC), traditionally known for its role in learning and memory, has emerged as a controller of food intake. While prior studies primarily associated the HPC with food intake inhibition, recent research suggests a critical role in appetitive processes. We hypothesized that orexigenic HPC neurons differentially respond to fats and/or sugars, potent natural reinforcers that contribute to obesity development. Results uncover previously-unrecognized, spatially-distinct neuronal ensembles within the dorsal HPC (dHPC) that are responsive to separate nutrient signals originating from the gut. Using activity-dependent genetic capture of nutrient-responsive HPC neurons, we demonstrate a causal role of both populations in promoting nutrient-specific preference through different mechanisms. Sugar-responsive neurons encode an appetitive spatial memory engram for meal location, whereas fat-responsive neurons selectively enhance the preference and motivation for fat intake. Collectively, these findings uncover a neural basis for the exquisite specificity in processing macronutrient signals from a meal that shape dietary choices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Facial features of immature individuals play a pivotal role in eliciting caretaking behaviors in humans. It has been posited that non-human animals share particular infantile facial features with humans, which can elicit caregivers attention and caretaking behaviors. Nevertheless, the empirical examination of this hypothesis is extremely limited. In this study, we investigated infantile facial features in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), their developmental processes, and their correlation with caretaking and infant behaviors, based on 470 facial photographs from one free-ranging group. We measured the size of facial parts and evaluated infantile facial features in Japanese macaques with non-contact procedures with the animals. The results indicated that, although some partial species differences were observed, the infantile facial features in Japanese macaques were broadly consistent with those previously observed in humans and great apes. Furthermore, half of the infant subjects displayed non-linear developmental trajectories of infantile faces similar to those suggested in humans. These changes were sex-based, with most females demonstrating a linear trajectory and most males a hump-shaped development in their facial proportions. However, unlike previous studies in humans, infantile faces were not significantly associated with maternal or non-maternal caretaking behaviors, nor were their developmental changes correlated with infant behavioral development. These findings indicate that while many aspects of infantile facial features are shared among particular primates, humans may have evolved a uniquely elevated preference for selecting such features among the primate lineage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.</p>
