Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

J.; Wang, I.-H.; Bear, D. M.; Nowlan, A.; Greer, P. L.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552498\nThe mammalian olfactory system detects and discriminates between millions of odorants to elicit appropriate behavioral responses. While much has been learned about how olfactory sensory neurons detect odorants and signal their presence, how specific innate, unlearned behaviors are initiated in response to ethologically relevant odors remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the 4-transmembrane protein CD20, also known as MS4A1, is expressed in a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium of the murine nasal cavity and functions as a mammalian odorant receptor that recognizes compounds produced by mouse predators. While wild-type mice avoid these predator odorants, mice genetically deleted of CD20 do not appropriately respond. Together, this work reveals a novel CD20-mediated odor-sensing mechanism in the mammalian olfactory system that triggers innate behaviors critical for organismal survival.\nMicroplastics reach the brain and interfere with honey bee cognition\nAuthors: Pasquini, E.; Ferrante, F.; Passaponti, L.; Pavone, F. S.; Costantini, I.; Baracchi, D.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552092\nScientific research exploring the impact of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial systems is still at an early stage but has already confirmed that exposure to plastics leads to various detrimental health effects in several organisms. Although recent studies have shown the toxicological effects of single MP polymers on honey bees, the effects of different polymer combinations and their consequences on cognitive and behavioural performance remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of MPs, both individually and in combination, on the cognitive abilities of the honey bee Apis mellifera. We evaluated the acute oral toxicity of Polystyrene (PS) and Plexiglass (PMMA) MPs, as well as a combination of the two (MIX), at three different concentrations (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L-1) and analysed their effects on sucrose responsiveness and appetitive olfactory learning and memory. We also explored whether these MPs could reach and accumulate in the insect brain using Two-Photon Fluorescence Microscopy (TPFM) in combination with an optimized version of the DISCO clearing technique. The results revealed that PS reduced the responsiveness of foragers to sucrose, whereas PMMA had no significant impact; however, the combination of PMMA and PS had a pronounced negative effect on sucrose responsiveness. In addition, both PMMA and PS, as well as MIX, impaired bee learning formation and memory retrieval, with PS exhibiting the most severe effects. Regarding our brain imaging analysis performed with TFPM, we found that after only three days of oral exposure, MPs could penetrate and accumulate in the brain. These results raise concerns about the potential mechanical, cellular, and biochemical damage that MPs may cause to the central nervous system.\nIndividuals lack the capacity to accurately detect emotional piloerection\nAuthors: McPhetres, J.; Han, A.; Gao, H. H.; Kemp, N.; Khati, B.; Pu, C. X.; Smith, A.; Shui, X.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549671\nPiloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being \"emotionally moved\" and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance. Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.\nWistar rats raised in an affectionate environment display lifesaving-like behaviors while distinguishing life from death\nAuthors: Mikami, K.; Kigami, Y.; Doi, T.; Choudhury, M. E.; Nishikawa, Y.; Takahashi, R.; Wada, Y.; Kakine, H.; Kawase, M.; Hiyama, N.; Yano, H.; Abe, N.; Yorozuya, T.; Nishihara, T.; Tanaka, J.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552239\nIt is generally believed that humans are the only species that values life. However, it is not well understood whether animals have a nature that values life. In this study, we attempted to determine whether male Wistar rats have this nature. Normally-reared rats did not show lifesaving-like actions towards anesthesia-induced comatose rats, although they seemed to distinguish life from death. Considering the possibility that different rearing conditions may foster a life-valuing nature, male Wistar rat pups were reared in several ways: normal rearing, loving rearing (LR; rats reared as if they were cute pets), rearing in an enriched environment, reared with gentle stroking of the back, and normal rearing of offspring of rats raised under LR conditions. When placed in an anxiety-producing environment, only LR rats escaped into the hands of the person who reared them, indicating attachment. Only the LR rats displayed lifesaving-like actions towards unknown comatose rats or drowning pups. LR rats also stopped attacks by biting ICR mice that were attacking C57BL/6 mice. Thus, rearing in an affectionate environment may foster a life-valuing nature, even in rats, suggesting that the valuing of life may be neither innate nor human-specific.\nSocial attention across development in common ravens and carrion crows\nAuthors: Miller (Harrison), R.; Boeckle, M.; Ridgway, S.; Richardson, J.; Uhl, F.; Bugnyar, T.; Schwab, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551806\nUnderlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head \u0026 body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone; C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of head \u0026 body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of others presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.\nDo Goats Recognise Humans Cross-Modally?\nAuthors: Mason, M. A.; Semple, S.; Marshall, H. H.; McElligott, A. G.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551944\nRecognition plays a key role in the social lives of gregarious species, enabling animals to distinguish among social partners and tailor their behaviour accordingly. As domesticated animals regularly interact with humans, as well as members of their own species, we might expect mechanisms used to discriminate between conspecifics to also apply to humans. Given that goats can combine visual and vocal cues to recognize one another, we investigated whether this cross-modal recognition extends to discriminating among familiar humans. We presented 28 goats with facial photographs of familiar people and two repeated playbacks of a voice, either congruent (from the same person) or incongruent with that photograph (from a different person). When cues were incongruent, violating their expectations, we expected goats to respond faster and for longer after playbacks and show increases in physiological arousal (increased heart rate and/or decreased heart rate variability). We found the increase in latency that goats took to respond as the playback series progressed was greater when the face and voice were incongruent. As differences were not as predicted and only observed in one response measured, our evidence is tentative, but the variation in latency to look between congruency conditions suggests goat cross-modal recognition extends to humans. If this is the case, not only would this further demonstrate the flexibility of complex recognition systems to discriminate among members of a very different species, but indicates goats can produce mental representations for familiar people, a key component of individual recognition.\nDivergent warning patterns influence male and female mating behaviours in a tropical butterfly\nAuthors: Kuo, C.-Y.; Melo-Flores, L.; Aragon, A.; Oberweiser, M. M.; McMillan, W. O.; Pardo-Diaz, C.; Salazar, C.; Merrill, R. M.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552099\nTraits under divergent ecological selection that also function during mating can be important in maintaining species boundaries. Few studies have considered mutual mate choice, where both males and females base mating decisions on the same trait. We investigated the contribution of visual preference to assortative mating between an aposematic butterfly Heliconius cydno and its sympatric relative H. melpomene. Wing colouration in Heliconius butterflies evolved as a warning signal but also functions as a mating cue. We predicted that both sexes of H. cydno contributed to assortative mating by exhibiting visual preference towards conspecific wing colouration. We analysed published and new data from preference experiments, in which males were presented with conspecific and H. melpomene females. We also recorded female responses and mating outcomes in choice experiments, involving conspecific males with either the original white or artificially painted red forewing bands. Both sexes of H. cydno responded more positively towards the conspecific colouration, yet male colouration did not predict mating outcomes in female choice experiments. As courtships are initiated by males in butterflies, our findings suggest that female visual preference might be of secondary importance in preventing gene flow between H. cydno and H. melpomene.\nMice remember experiences via conspecific-context: models of social episodic-like memory\nAuthors: Ross, T. W.; Poulter, S. L.; Lever, C.; Easton, A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552022\nThe ability to remember unique past events (episodic memory) may be an evolutionarily conserved function, with accumulating evidence of episodic-(like) memory processing in rodents. In humans, it likely contributes to successful complex social networking. Rodents, arguably the most used laboratory models, are also rather social animals. However, many behavioural paradigms are devoid of sociality, and commonly-used social spontaneous recognition tasks (SRTs) are open to non-episodic strategies based upon familiarity. We address this gap by developing new SRT variants. Here, in object-in-context SRTs, we asked if context could be specified by the presence/absence of either a conspecific (experiment 1) or an additional local object (experiment 2). We show that mice readily used the conspecific as contextual information to distinguish unique episodes in memory. In contrast, no coherent behavioural response emerged when an additional object was used as a potential context specifier. Further, in a new social conspecific-in-context SRT (experiment 3) where environment-based change was the context specifier, mice preferably explored a more recently-seen familiar conspecific associated with contextual mismatch, over a less recently-seen familiar conspecific presented in the same context. The results argue that, in incidental SRT conditions, mice readily incorporate conspecific cue information into episodic-like memory. Thus, the tasks offer different ways to assess and further understand the mechanisms at work in social episodic-like memory processing.\nBunDLe-Net: Neuronal Manifold Learning Meets Behaviour\nAuthors: Kumar, A.; Gilra, A.; Gonzalez-Soto, M.; Grosse-Wentrup, M.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.551978\nNeuronal manifold learning techniques represent high-dimensional neuronal dynamics in low-dimensional embeddings to reveal the intrinsic structure of neuronal manifolds. Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BunDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BunDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BunDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BunDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek self-stimulation on a carousel.

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian olfactory system detects and discriminates between millions of odorants to elicit appropriate behavioral responses. While much has been learned about how olfactory sensory neurons detect odorants and signal their presence, how specific innate, unlearned behaviors are initiated in response to ethologically relevant odors remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the 4-transmembrane protein CD20, also known as MS4A1, is expressed in a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium of the murine nasal cavity and functions as a mammalian odorant receptor that recognizes compounds produced by mouse predators. While wild-type mice avoid these predator odorants, mice genetically deleted of CD20 do not appropriately respond. Together, this work reveals a novel CD20-mediated odor-sensing mechanism in the mammalian olfactory system that triggers innate behaviors critical for organismal survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Scientific research exploring the impact of microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial systems is still at an early stage but has already confirmed that exposure to plastics leads to various detrimental health effects in several organisms. Although recent studies have shown the toxicological effects of single MP polymers on honey bees, the effects of different polymer combinations and their consequences on cognitive and behavioural performance remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effects of MPs, both individually and in combination, on the cognitive abilities of the honey bee Apis mellifera. We evaluated the acute oral toxicity of Polystyrene (PS) and Plexiglass (PMMA) MPs, as well as a combination of the two (MIX), at three different concentrations (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L-1) and analysed their effects on sucrose responsiveness and appetitive olfactory learning and memory. We also explored whether these MPs could reach and accumulate in the insect brain using Two-Photon Fluorescence Microscopy (TPFM) in combination with an optimized version of the DISCO clearing technique. The results revealed that PS reduced the responsiveness of foragers to sucrose, whereas PMMA had no significant impact; however, the combination of PMMA and PS had a pronounced negative effect on sucrose responsiveness. In addition, both PMMA and PS, as well as MIX, impaired bee learning formation and memory retrieval, with PS exhibiting the most severe effects. Regarding our brain imaging analysis performed with TFPM, we found that after only three days of oral exposure, MPs could penetrate and accumulate in the brain. These results raise concerns about the potential mechanical, cellular, and biochemical damage that MPs may cause to the central nervous system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being &#34;emotionally moved&#34; and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.

Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is generally believed that humans are the only species that values life. However, it is not well understood whether animals have a nature that values life. In this study, we attempted to determine whether male Wistar rats have this nature. Normally-reared rats did not show lifesaving-like actions towards anesthesia-induced comatose rats, although they seemed to distinguish life from death. Considering the possibility that different rearing conditions may foster a life-valuing nature, male Wistar rat pups were reared in several ways: normal rearing, loving rearing (LR; rats reared as if they were cute pets), rearing in an enriched environment, reared with gentle stroking of the back, and normal rearing of offspring of rats raised under LR conditions. When placed in an anxiety-producing environment, only LR rats escaped into the hands of the person who reared them, indicating attachment. Only the LR rats displayed lifesaving-like actions towards unknown comatose rats or drowning pups. LR rats also stopped attacks by biting ICR mice that were attacking C57BL/6 mice. Thus, rearing in an affectionate environment may foster a life-valuing nature, even in rats, suggesting that the valuing of life may be neither innate nor human-specific.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Underlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head &amp; body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone; C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and  play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of  head &amp; body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of others presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recognition plays a key role in the social lives of gregarious species, enabling animals to distinguish among social partners and tailor their behaviour accordingly. As domesticated animals regularly interact with humans, as well as members of their own species, we might expect mechanisms used to discriminate between conspecifics to also apply to humans. Given that goats can combine visual and vocal cues to recognize one another, we investigated whether this cross-modal recognition extends to discriminating among familiar humans. We presented 28 goats with facial photographs of familiar people and two repeated playbacks of a voice, either congruent (from the same person) or incongruent with that photograph (from a different person). When cues were incongruent, violating their expectations, we expected goats to respond faster and for longer after playbacks and show increases in physiological arousal (increased heart rate and/or decreased heart rate variability). We found the increase in latency that goats took to respond as the playback series progressed was greater when the face and voice were incongruent. As differences were not as predicted and only observed in one response measured, our evidence is tentative, but the variation in latency to look between congruency conditions suggests goat cross-modal recognition extends to humans. If this is the case, not only would this further demonstrate the flexibility of complex recognition systems to discriminate among members of a very different species, but indicates goats can produce mental representations for familiar people, a key component of individual recognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Traits under divergent ecological selection that also function during mating can be important in maintaining species boundaries. Few studies have considered mutual mate choice, where both males and females base mating decisions on the same trait. We investigated the contribution of visual preference to assortative mating between an aposematic butterfly Heliconius cydno and its sympatric relative H. melpomene. Wing colouration in Heliconius butterflies evolved as a warning signal but also functions as a mating cue. We predicted that both sexes of H. cydno contributed to assortative mating by exhibiting visual preference towards conspecific wing colouration. We analysed published and new data from preference experiments, in which males were presented with conspecific and H. melpomene females. We also recorded female responses and mating outcomes in choice experiments, involving conspecific males with either the original white or artificially painted red forewing bands. Both sexes of H. cydno responded more positively towards the conspecific colouration, yet male colouration did not predict mating outcomes in female choice experiments. As courtships are initiated by males in butterflies, our findings suggest that female visual preference might be of secondary importance in preventing gene flow between H. cydno and H. melpomene.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to remember unique past events (episodic memory) may be an evolutionarily conserved function, with accumulating evidence of episodic-(like) memory processing in rodents. In humans, it likely contributes to successful complex social networking. Rodents, arguably the most used laboratory models, are also rather social animals. However, many behavioural paradigms are devoid of sociality, and commonly-used social spontaneous recognition tasks (SRTs) are open to non-episodic strategies based upon familiarity. We address this gap by developing new SRT variants. Here, in object-in-context SRTs, we asked if context could be specified by the presence/absence of either a conspecific (experiment 1) or an additional local object (experiment 2). We show that mice readily used the conspecific as contextual information to distinguish unique episodes in memory. In contrast, no coherent behavioural response emerged when an additional object was used as a potential context specifier. Further, in a new social conspecific-in-context SRT (experiment 3) where environment-based change was the context specifier, mice preferably explored a more recently-seen familiar conspecific associated with contextual mismatch, over a less recently-seen familiar conspecific presented in the same context. The results argue that, in incidental SRT conditions, mice readily incorporate conspecific cue information into episodic-like memory. Thus, the tasks offer different ways to assess and further understand the mechanisms at work in social episodic-like memory processing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuronal manifold learning techniques represent high-dimensional neuronal dynamics in low-dimensional embeddings to reveal the intrinsic structure of neuronal manifolds. Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BunDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BunDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BunDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BunDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.</p>
