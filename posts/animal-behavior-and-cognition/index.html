C.\nScore: 44.6, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547484\nWe present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.\nBehavioral and Neural Resilience to Isolation in a Eusocial Insect\nAuthors: Goolsby, B. C.; Smith, E. J.; Muratore, I. B.; Coto, Z. N.; Muscedere, M. L.; Traniello, J. F. A.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.546928\nSocial experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.\nA model-based hypothesis framework to define and estimate the diel niche via the 'Diel.Niche' R package\nAuthors: Gerber, B. D.; Devarajan, K.; Farris, Z. J.; Fidino, M.\nScore: 31.8, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545898\nO_LIHow animals use the diel period (24-hour light-dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes. C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime). C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available. C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators. C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

J.; Ogasawara, D.; Cravatt, B. F.; Uusisaari, M. Y.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546437\nThe neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.\nHiding in the bush, in fear of a predator! Vegetation and predators influence shoaling among wild zebrafish\nAuthors: Mukherjee, I.; Bhat, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547402\nSocial responses of aquatic group-living organisms are critically dependent on predation risk and vegetation cover in their habitat. To gain insight into how these factors shape their immediate responses, we exposed wild zebrafish shoals to either vegetation, predator cues or both these factors simultaneously. Control treatments were not exposed to the above factors. By analyzing 60 unique shoals across 270 experimental trials, we found that while shoals formed significantly larger subgroups and were significantly more polarized in the presence of predator cues, both these properties decreased when shoals experienced predator cues in presence of vegetation. Furthermore, foraging was significantly lower when predator cues and/or vegetation were present. Tracking of all individuals in treatments devoid of vegetation revealed that: (i) compared to control treatments, individuals within shoals receiving predator cues had a significantly higher probability to continue being in a group and (ii) in both treatments individuals occupying the front positions deviated lesser from their median position within a shoal as compared to other individuals. Anti-predator responses and foraging are critical for survival and therefore, this study provides important insights into shoal dynamics in changing environments.\nSolitary Silence and Social Sounds: Music influences mental imagery, inducing thoughts of social interactions\nAuthors: Herff, S. A.; Cecchetti, G.; Ericson, P.; Cano, E.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546175\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear. In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages. Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.\nTimed sequence task: a new paradigm to study motor learning and flexibility in mice\nAuthors: Urushadze, A.; Janicek, M.; Abbondanza, A.; Janickova, H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547172\nMotor learning and flexibility allow animals to perform routine actions efficiently while keeping them flexible. There is a number of paradigms used to test cognitive flexibility but not many of them focus specifically on learning of complex motor sequences and their flexibility. While many tests use operant or touchscreen boxes that offer high throughput and reproducibility, the motor actions themselves are mostly simple presses of a designated lever. To focus more on motor actions during the operant task and to probe the flexibility of these well-trained actions, we developed a new operant paradigm for mice, the \"timed sequence task\". The task requires mice to learn a sequence of lever presses that have to be emitted in precisely defined time limits. After training, the required pressing sequence and/or timing of individual presses is modified to test the ability of mice to alter their previously trained motor actions. We provide a code for the new protocol that can be used and adapted to common types of operant boxes. In addition, we provide a set of scripts that allow automatic extraction and analysis of numerous parameters recorded during each session. We demonstrate that the analysis of multiple performance parameters is necessary for detailed insight into animals' behavior during the task. We validate our paradigm in an experiment using the valproate model of autism as a model of cognitive inflexibility. We show that the valproate mice show superior performance at specific stages of the task, paradoxically due to their propensity to more stereotypic behavior.\nStochastic characterization of navigation strategies in an automated variant of the Barnes maze\nAuthors: Lee, J.-Y.; Jung, D.; Royer, S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.14.536859\nAnimals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate from a random start vestibule to a goal vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences; and revealed a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.\nEnvironmental enrichment promotes adaptive responding during tests of behavioral regulation in male heterogeneous stock rats\nAuthors: Ishiwari, K.; King, C.

H.; Meyer, P. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547228\nOrganisms must regulate their behavior flexibly in the face of environmental challenges. Failure can lead to a host of maladaptive behavioral traits associated with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and substance use disorders. This maladaptive dysregulation of behavior is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. For example, environmental enrichment produces beneficial neurobehavioral effects in animal models of such disorders. The present study determined the effects of environmental enrichment on a range of measures related to behavioral regulation using a large cohort of male, outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as subjects to mimic the genetic variability found in the human population. Subjects were reared from late adolescence onwards either in pairs in standard housing with minimal enrichment (n=200) or in groups of 16 in a highly enriched environment consisting of a large multi-level cage filled with toys, running wheels, and shelters (n=64). Rats were subjected to a battery of tests, including: (i) locomotor response to novelty, (iI) light reinforcement, (iii) social reinforcement, (iv) reaction time, (v) a patch-depletion foraging test, (vi) Pavlovian conditioned approach, (vii) conditioned reinforcement, and (viii) cocaine conditioned cue preference. Results indicated that rats housed in the enriched environment were able to filter out irrelevant stimuli more effectively and thereby regulate their behavior more efficiently than standard-housing rats. The dramatic impact of environmental enrichment suggests that behavioral studies using standard housing conditions may not generalize to more complex environments that may be more ethologically relevant.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIHow animals use the diel period (24-hour light-dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes.
C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime).
C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available.
C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators.
C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

        <p class="abstract">The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social responses of aquatic group-living organisms are critically dependent on predation risk and vegetation cover in their habitat. To gain insight into how these factors shape their immediate responses, we exposed wild zebrafish shoals to either vegetation, predator cues or both these factors simultaneously. Control treatments were not exposed to the above factors. By analyzing 60 unique shoals across 270 experimental trials, we found that while shoals formed significantly larger subgroups and were significantly more polarized in the presence of predator cues, both these properties decreased when shoals experienced predator cues in presence of vegetation. Furthermore, foraging was significantly lower when predator cues and/or vegetation were present. Tracking of all individuals in treatments devoid of vegetation revealed that: (i) compared to control treatments, individuals within shoals receiving predator cues had a significantly higher probability to continue being in a group and (ii) in both treatments individuals occupying the front positions deviated lesser from their median position within a shoal as compared to other individuals. Anti-predator responses and foraging are critical for survival and therefore, this study provides important insights into shoal dynamics in changing environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music  to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear.

In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages.

Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motor learning and flexibility allow animals to perform routine actions efficiently while keeping them flexible. There is a number of paradigms used to test cognitive flexibility but not many of them focus specifically on learning of complex motor sequences and their flexibility. While many tests use operant or touchscreen boxes that offer high throughput and reproducibility, the motor actions themselves are mostly simple presses of a designated lever. To focus more on motor actions during the operant task and to probe the flexibility of these well-trained actions, we developed a new operant paradigm for mice, the &#34;timed sequence task&#34;. The task requires mice to learn a sequence of lever presses that have to be emitted in precisely defined time limits. After training, the required pressing sequence and/or timing of individual presses is modified to test the ability of mice to alter their previously trained motor actions. We provide a code for the new protocol that can be used and adapted to common types of operant boxes. In addition, we provide a set of scripts that allow automatic extraction and analysis of numerous parameters recorded during each session. We demonstrate that the analysis of multiple performance parameters is necessary for detailed insight into animals&#39; behavior during the task. We validate our paradigm in an experiment using the valproate model of autism as a model of cognitive inflexibility. We show that the valproate mice show superior performance at specific stages of the task, paradoxically due to their propensity to more stereotypic behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate from a random start vestibule to a goal vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences; and revealed a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms must regulate their behavior flexibly in the face of environmental challenges. Failure can lead to a host of maladaptive behavioral traits associated with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and substance use disorders. This maladaptive dysregulation of behavior is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. For example, environmental enrichment produces beneficial neurobehavioral effects in animal models of such disorders. The present study determined the effects of environmental enrichment on a range of measures related to behavioral regulation using a large cohort of male, outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as subjects to mimic the genetic variability found in the human population. Subjects were reared from late adolescence onwards either in pairs in standard housing with minimal enrichment (n=200) or in groups of 16 in a highly enriched environment consisting of a large multi-level cage filled with toys, running wheels, and shelters (n=64). Rats were subjected to a battery of tests, including: (i) locomotor response to novelty, (iI) light reinforcement, (iii) social reinforcement, (iv) reaction time, (v) a patch-depletion foraging test, (vi) Pavlovian conditioned approach, (vii) conditioned reinforcement, and (viii) cocaine conditioned cue preference. Results indicated that rats housed in the enriched environment were able to filter out irrelevant stimuli more effectively and thereby regulate their behavior more efficiently than standard-housing rats. The dramatic impact of environmental enrichment suggests that behavioral studies using standard housing conditions may not generalize to more complex environments that may be more ethologically relevant.</p>
