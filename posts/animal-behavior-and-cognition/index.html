Statistical tools for movement data analysis, however, have long been limited, and in particular, unable to account for past movement information except in a very simplified way. In this work, we propose MoveFormer, a new step-based model of movement capable of learning directly from full animal trajectories. While inspired by the classical step-selection framework and previous work on the quantification of uncertainty in movement predictions, MoveFormer also builds upon recent developments in deep learning, such as the Transformer architecture, allowing it to incorporate long temporal contexts. The model predicts an animals next movement step given its past movement history, including not only purely positional and temporal information, but also any available environmental covariates such as land cover or temperature. We apply our model to a diverse dataset made up of over 1550 trajectories from over 100 studies, and show how it can be used to gain insights about the importance of the provided context features, including the extent of past movement history. Our software, along with the trained model weights, is released as open source.\nPositive Transfer of the Whisper Speech Transformer to Human and Animal Voice Activity Detection\nAuthors: Gu, N.; Lee, K.; Basha, M.; Ram, S. K.; You, G.; Hahnloser, R.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560270\nThis paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.\nNovel Epidermal Oxysterols Function as Alarm Substances in Zebrafish\nAuthors: Li, Y.; Yan, Z.; Lin, A.; Yang, X.; Li, X.; Yin, X.; Li, W.; Li, K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559639\nAquatic animals often use chemical cues to signal predation risk. When injured, shoaling fish skins release alarm substances that induce intense fear and a suite of anti-predator behaviors in other shoal members. However, the chemical nature of alarm substances remains largely unknown. Here we show that zebrafish alarm substance comprises 24-methyl-5-cholestane-3,7,12,24,28-pentahydroxy 28-sulfate, a novel oxysterol sulfate, and 5-cyprinol sulfate. These compounds are present in zebrafish skin extract and, at concentrations of less than one nanomolar, each induces anti-predator behaviors and increases cortisol levels. Their mixture, at its natural ratio, replicates the skin extract in eliciting the full suite of anti-predator behavior patterns. Our findings reveal a molecular-level mechanism whereby fish signal predation danger.\nThe effects of sport-specific training on individuals action strategies while avoiding a virtual player approaching on a 45{o} angle while completing a secondary task\nAuthors: Thompson, B.; Cinelli, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559848\nSports provide varying scenarios where athletes must interact with and avoid opposing players in dynamic environments. As such, sport-specific training can improve one's ability to integrate visual information which may result in improved collision avoidance behaviours. However, improved visuomotor capabilities are highly task dependent (i.e., athletes must be tested in sport-specific settings). The current study examined whether sport-specific training influenced individuals' collision avoidance behaviours during a sport-specific task in virtual reality. Untrained young adults (N=21, 22.9{+/-}1.9 yrs, 11 males) and specifically trained athletes (N=18, 20{+/-}1.5 yrs, 7 males) were immersed in a virtual environment and were instructed to walk along a 7.5m path towards a goal located along the midline. Two virtual players positioned 2.83m to the left and right of the midline approached participants on a 45{o} angle at one of three speeds: 0.8x, 1.0x, or 1.2x each participants average walking speed. Participants were instructed to walk to a goal without colliding with the virtual players while performing a secondary task; reporting whether a shape changed above either of the virtual players heads. Results revealed that athletes had a higher percentage of correct responses on the secondary task compared to untrained young adults. However, there was no group differences in the average time to first avoidance or average minimum clearance, but athletes were more variable in their avoidance behaviours. Findings from this study demonstrate that athletes may be more adaptive in their behaviours and may perform better on attentionally demanding tasks in dynamic environments.\nElegansBot: Development of equation of motion deciphering locomotion including omega turns of Caenorhabditis elegans\nAuthors: Chung, T.; Chang, I.; Kim, S.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559644\nLocomotion is a fundamental behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Previous works on kinetic simulations of animals helped researchers understand the physical mechanisms of locomotion and the muscle-controlling principles of neuronal circuits as an actuator part. It has yet to be understood how C. elegans utilizes the frictional forces caused by the tension of its muscles to perform sequenced locomotive behaviors. Here, we present a two-dimensional rigid body chain model for the locomotion of C. elegans by developing Newtonian equations of motion for each body segment of C. elegans. Having accounted for friction-coefficients of the surrounding environment, elastic constants of C. elegans, and its kymogram from experiments, our kinetic model (ElegansBot) reproduced various locomotion of C. elegans such as, but not limited to, forward-backward-(omega turn)-forward locomotion constituting escaping behavior and delta-turn navigation. Additionally, ElegansBot precisely quantified the forces acting on each body segment of C. elegans to allow investigation of the force distribution. This model will facilitate our understanding of the detailed mechanism of various locomotive behaviors at any given friction-coefficients of the surrounding environment. Furthermore, as the model ensures the performance of realistic behavior, it can be used to research actuator-controller interaction between muscles and neuronal circuits.\nWild sulphur-crested cockatoos match human activity rhythms to access food in the urban environment\nAuthors: Fehlmann, G.; Martin, J. M.; Safi, K.; Aplin, L. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.555651\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUrban areas are growing rapidly across the globe, and wild species are occupying this new environment. Despite offering potential resources, disparities in the urban matrix can lead to specific challenges, with pathways and resources fragmented in space and time. Urban-dwelling species would therefore benefit from learning when and where to exploit human derived food. Here, we investigate whether birds synchronize the exploitation of the most urbanized areas to match food-provisioning patterns, using the example of the popular hand-feeding of sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) in Sydney, Australia. We monitored the provisioning behaviour of people via a large-scale citizen science program, and tested for synchrony with the spatial behaviour of eight birds equipped with GPS loggers. Our data show that sulphur-crested cockatoos exploited the urban environment, relying on the green areas of the city; importantly, they also visited buildings within more urbanized areas. Sulphur-crested cockatoos used urban space with specific time patterns particularly matching human recreational feeding routines, suggestive of time-place learning. We show that urban environments provide daily temporal foraging resources for which species adjust behaviorally. Thus, our data support the general claim that retaining green spaces in cities is essential to sustainable urban planning, and key to allow species to exploit the urban environment, particularly in areas of high human density. This study builds on the literature investigating human-animal interactions, expanding our understanding of animals exploitation of human behavior. Further research should include the impact of such interactions on urban wildlifes fitness according to their cognitive and behavioral traits.\n",

        <p class="abstract">This paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aquatic animals often use chemical cues to signal predation risk. When injured, shoaling fish skins release alarm substances that induce intense fear and a suite of anti-predator behaviors in other shoal members. However, the chemical nature of alarm substances remains largely unknown. Here we show that zebrafish alarm substance comprises 24-methyl-5-cholestane-3,7,12,24,28-pentahydroxy 28-sulfate, a novel oxysterol sulfate, and 5-cyprinol sulfate. These compounds are present in zebrafish skin extract and, at concentrations of less than one nanomolar, each induces anti-predator behaviors and increases cortisol levels. Their mixture, at its natural ratio, replicates the skin extract in eliciting the full suite of anti-predator behavior patterns. Our findings reveal a molecular-level mechanism whereby fish signal predation danger.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sports provide varying scenarios where athletes must interact with and avoid opposing players in dynamic environments. As such, sport-specific training can improve one&#39;s ability to integrate visual information which may result in improved collision avoidance behaviours. However, improved visuomotor capabilities are highly task dependent (i.e., athletes must be tested in sport-specific settings). The current study examined whether sport-specific training influenced individuals&#39; collision avoidance behaviours during a sport-specific task in virtual reality. Untrained young adults (N=21, 22.9{&#43;/-}1.9 yrs, 11 males) and specifically trained athletes (N=18, 20{&#43;/-}1.5 yrs, 7 males) were immersed in a virtual environment and were instructed to walk along a 7.5m path towards a goal located along the midline. Two virtual players positioned 2.83m to the left and right of the midline approached participants on a 45{o} angle at one of three speeds: 0.8x, 1.0x, or 1.2x each participants average walking speed. Participants were instructed to walk to a goal without colliding with the virtual players while performing a secondary task; reporting whether a shape changed above either of the virtual players heads. Results revealed that athletes had a higher percentage of correct responses on the secondary task compared to untrained young adults. However, there was no group differences in the average time to first avoidance or average minimum clearance, but athletes were more variable in their avoidance behaviours. Findings from this study demonstrate that athletes may be more adaptive in their behaviours and may perform better on attentionally demanding tasks in dynamic environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Locomotion is a fundamental behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Previous works on kinetic simulations of animals helped researchers understand the physical mechanisms of locomotion and the muscle-controlling principles of neuronal circuits as an actuator part. It has yet to be understood how C. elegans utilizes the frictional forces caused by the tension of its muscles to perform sequenced locomotive behaviors. Here, we present a two-dimensional rigid body chain model for the locomotion of C. elegans by developing Newtonian equations of motion for each body segment of C. elegans. Having accounted for friction-coefficients of the surrounding environment, elastic constants of C. elegans, and its kymogram from experiments, our kinetic model (ElegansBot) reproduced various locomotion of C. elegans such as, but not limited to, forward-backward-(omega turn)-forward locomotion constituting escaping behavior and delta-turn navigation. Additionally, ElegansBot precisely quantified the forces acting on each body segment of C. elegans to allow investigation of the force distribution. This model will facilitate our understanding of the detailed mechanism of various locomotive behaviors at any given friction-coefficients of the surrounding environment. Furthermore, as the model ensures the performance of realistic behavior, it can be used to research actuator-controller interaction between muscles and neuronal circuits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUrban areas are growing rapidly across the globe, and wild species are occupying this new environment. Despite offering potential resources, disparities in the urban matrix can lead to specific challenges, with pathways and resources fragmented in space and time. Urban-dwelling species would therefore benefit from learning when and where to exploit human derived food. Here, we investigate whether birds synchronize the exploitation of the most urbanized areas to match food-provisioning patterns, using the example of the popular hand-feeding of sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) in Sydney, Australia. We monitored the provisioning behaviour of people via a large-scale citizen science program, and tested for synchrony with the spatial behaviour of eight birds equipped with GPS loggers. Our data show that sulphur-crested cockatoos exploited the urban environment, relying on the green areas of the city; importantly, they also visited buildings within more urbanized areas. Sulphur-crested cockatoos used urban space with specific time patterns particularly matching human recreational feeding routines, suggestive of time-place learning. We show that urban environments provide daily temporal foraging resources for which species adjust behaviorally. Thus, our data support the general claim that retaining green spaces in cities is essential to sustainable urban planning, and key to allow species to exploit the urban environment, particularly in areas of high human density. This study builds on the literature investigating human-animal interactions, expanding our understanding of animals exploitation of human behavior. Further research should include the impact of such interactions on urban wildlifes fitness according to their cognitive and behavioral traits.</p>
