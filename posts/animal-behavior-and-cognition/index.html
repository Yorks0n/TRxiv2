K.\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558032\nAnimals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics. Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.\nNoxious stimulation induces self-protective behaviour in bumblebees\nAuthors: Gibbons, M.; Pasquini, E.; Kowalewska, A.; Read, E.; Gibson, S.; Crump, A.; Solvi, C.; Versace, E.; Chittka, L.\nScore: 149.3, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575734\nSelf-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nHuman-like dissociations between confidence and accuracy in convolutional neural networks\nAuthors: Shekhar, M.; Rahnev, D.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578187\nPrior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from low-level changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet -50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of the CNNs internal representations leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for adjudicating between low-level, stimulus-driven and high-level, cognitive explanations of human behavior.\nInhibition of V1a-like receptors disrupts male-male affiliative relationships formed by triadic cohabitation inlarge-billed crows\nAuthors: Seguchi, A.; Izawa, E.-I.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578519\nAffiliative relationships, such as parent-offspring bonds, male-female pair-bonds, and within-sex coalitions/alliances, are beneficial for group-living animals to increase fitness and reproductive success. Male-male affiliative relationship, such as coalitions/alliances, have been reported in social mammals and birds in situations where three or more individuals interact, suggesting that male-male affiliative relationships can be formed via interactive situations involving three (or more) individuals. However, no experimental studies have tested this hypothesis on social animals. Many studies on mammals and birds have revealed that an affiliative relationship is underpinned by the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin (VP) system. However, the role of the OT/VP system has been studied only in parent-offspring bonds and pair-bonds and is lacking in male-male affiliative relationships. In this study, we found the 2-week cohabitation of three male crows in an aviary facilitated affiliative relationship formation between two of the three crows (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of peripheral administration of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist peripheral administration on the social behaviour of affiliated males. We found that the V1aR antagonist caused the disappearance of affiliative behaviour and the resurgence of agonistic behaviour in affiliated males. Our findings provide the first evidence for V1aR involvement in male-male affiliative relationships in vertebrates.\nCharacterisation of behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in the aged male rat\nAuthors: Jackson, M. G.; Lightman, S. L.; Robinson, E. S. J.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578556\nApathy is a complex psychiatric syndrome characterised by motivational deficit, emotional blunting and cognitive changes. It occurs alongside a broad range of neurological disorders, but also occurs in otherwise healthy ageing. Despite its clinical prevalence, apathy does not yet have a designated treatment strategy. Generation of a translational animal model of apathy syndrome would facilitate the development of novel treatments. Given the multidimensional nature of apathy, a model cannot be achieved with a single behavioural test. Using a battery of behavioural tests we investigated whether aged rats exhibit behavioural deficits across different domains relevant to apathy. Using the effort for reward and progressive ratio tasks we found that aged rats (21-27 months) show intact reward motivation. Using the novelty supressed feeding test and position-based object exploration we found aged rats showed increased anxiety-like behaviour inconsistent with emotional blunting. The sucrose preference test and reward learning assay showed intact reward sensitivity and reward-related cognition in aged rats. However, using a bowl-digging version of the probabilistic reversal learning task, we found a deficit in cognitive flexibility in aged rats that did not translate across to a touchscreen version of the task. While these data reveal important changes in cognitive flexibility and anxiety associated with ageing, aged rats do not show deficits across other behavioural domains relevant to apathy. This suggests that aged rats are not a suitable model for age-related apathy syndrome. These findings contrast with previous work in mice, revealing important species differences in behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in ageing.\nMountable miniature microphones to identify and assign mouse ultrasonic vocalizations\nAuthors: Waidmann, E. N.; Yang, V. H.; Doyle, W. C.; Jarvis, E. D.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.579003\nVocal communication is a major component of animal social behavior. Vocalizations can be learned or innate, and can convey a variety of signals, including territorial limits, the presence of predators, or courtship intent. Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a promising model in which to study mammalian vocal production circuits. While mouse USVs are innate, mice still show complex vocal behavior, including production of structured song composed of multiple syllable types and the ability to modify their vocal rate and syllable repertoire based on social conditions. Though in courtship interactions male mice produce the majority of the emitted USVs, female mice are capable of emitting USVs. In order to study the underlying mechanisms of vocal production in freely behaving pairs of mice, it is necessary to identify the individual responsible for each syllable in group settings. Previous methods to identify the source of an individual USVs have used high-density microphone arrays and triangulation methods, which involve the use of multiple costly microphones and require implementation of complex computational methods. Here we identified, developed, and used an inexpensive, mountable, ultrasound-sensitive miniature-microphone system to record and identify USVs from individual mice during dual socializing behavior. Our system includes custom circuit boards that can be fitted to individual mice and connected to a variety of existing USV recording systems. We found that these miniature microphones reliably detected mouse USVs, and that a high percentage (90%) of vocalizations could be attributed to a specific animal in a vocalizing pair based on the relative amplitude differences alone. This simple readout method avoids the implementation of complicated triangulation methods. By pairing this method with simultaneous video recording and automated animal body part and identity tracking, we were able to study and describe the broader courtship behavioral landscape, in which USV production is one component. These results offer a promising, low-cost, and simple method that researchers can implement to study the social vocal communication between at least pairs of vocalizing mice.\nvmTracking: Virtual Markers Overcome Occlusion and Crowding in Multi-Animal Pose Tracking\nAuthors: Azechi, H.; Takahashi, S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579241\nOvercoming occlusion and crowding in multi-animal tracking remains challenging. Thus, we aim to introduce virtual marker tracking (vmTracking) as a solution to these problems. This method integrates markerless multi-animal pose estimation, including multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) or Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP), with single-animal tracking techniques, such as DeepLabCut and LEAP. Initially, maDLC or SLEAP is employed to create videos in which the tracking results are labeled as \"virtual markers.\" Subsequently, these virtual markers are used to ensure consistent animal identification across frames, and the animals are tracked using single-animal tracking. vmTracking significantly reduces the need for manual corrections and the number of annotation frames required for training. It more efficiently improves occlusion and crowding compared with traditional markerless multi-animal tracking, which relies on motion state estimation. The findings of this research have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and dependability of tracking methods used in the analysis of intricate naturalistic and social behaviors in animals.\nReady, set, yellow! Color Preference of Indian Free-ranging Dogs\nAuthors: Roy, A.; Lahiri, A.; Nandi, S.; Manchalwar, A.; S, S.; Bhadra, A.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578151\nMost of the research on color vision related behaviors in dogs has involved training the dogs to perform visual discrimination tasks. We investigated the meaning of color to untrained Indian free-ranging dogs (FRDs). Using one-time multi-option choice tests for color preference in 134 adult dogs, we found the dogs to prefer yellow objects over blue or gray ones (p \u003c 0.001, Cramers V = 0.433) while there was no preference between blue and gray (N = 102, p = 0.165). We next pitted a yellow object against a gray object that had food. Here, the dogs ignored the food to approach the yellow object first, both when the food was biscuit (N = 52, p \u003c 0.001, Cramers V = 0.576) and chicken (N = 61, p \u003c 0.001, Cramers V = 0.540), indicating the color preference to be quite strong. Color preference has previously been investigated in many other animals and has implications for behaviors like mate choice and foraging. Our study provides a new perspective into the ecology of Indian FRDs and might have implications for pet dogs as well, if they too show this preference. HighlightsO_LIIndian free-ranging dogs (FRDs) show preference toward the color yellow over blue and gray. C_LIO_LIIndian FRDs show no preference between blue and gray colors. C_LIO_LIAttraction towards a yellow object can be stronger than attraction towards food rewards for Indian FRDs.

A.; Saxe, M.; Wichmann, J.; David, D. J.; David, I. M.; Augustin, A.; Fischer, H.; Golling, S.; Lamerz, J.; Roth, D.; Graf, M.; Zoffmann, S.; Santarelli, L.; Jagasia, R.; Hen, R.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578406\nBACKGROUNDImpairments in behavioral pattern separation (BPS)--the ability to distinguish between similar contexts or experiences--contribute to memory interference and overgeneralization seen in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline. While BPS relies on the dentate gyrus and is sensitive to changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), its significance as a pharmacological target has not been tested. METHODSIn this study, we applied a human neural stem cell high-throughput screening cascade to identify compounds that increase human neurogenesis. One compound with a favorable profile, RO6871135, was then tested in BPS in mice. RESULTSChronic treatment with RO6871135, 7.5 mg/kg increased AHN and improved BPS in a fear discrimination task in both young and aged mice. RO6871135 treatment also lowered innate anxiety-like behavior, which was more apparent in mice exposed to chronic corticosterone. Ablation of AHN by hippocampal irradiation supported a neurogenesis-dependent mechanism for RO6871135-induced improvements in BPS. To identify possible mechanisms of action, in vitro and in vivo kinase inhibition and chemical proteomics assays were performed. These tests indicated that RO6871135 inhibited CDK8, CDK11, CaMK2a, CaMK2b, MAP2K6, and GSK3b. An analog compound also demonstrated high affinity for CDK8, CaMK2a, and GSK3b. CONCLUSIONSThese studies demonstrate a method for empirical identification and preclinical testing of novel neurogenic compounds that can improve BPS, and points to possible novel mechanisms that can be interrogated for the development of new therapies to improve specific endophenotypes such as impaired BPS.\nProjections from thalamic nucleus reuniens to hippocampal CA1 area enable context value updating\nAuthors: Ziołkowska, M.; Sotoudeh, N.; Cały, A.; Puchalska, M.; Pagano, R.; Sliwinska, M. A.; Salamian, A.; Radwanska, K.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578155\nThe ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-\u0026gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-\u0026gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Animals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics.

Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from low-level changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet -50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of the CNNs internal representations leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for adjudicating between low-level, stimulus-driven and high-level, cognitive explanations of human behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Affiliative relationships, such as parent-offspring bonds, male-female pair-bonds, and within-sex coalitions/alliances, are beneficial for group-living animals to increase fitness and reproductive success. Male-male affiliative relationship, such as coalitions/alliances, have been reported in social mammals and birds in situations where three or more individuals interact, suggesting that male-male affiliative relationships can be formed via interactive situations involving three (or more) individuals. However, no experimental studies have tested this hypothesis on social animals. Many studies on mammals and birds have revealed that an affiliative relationship is underpinned by the oxytocin (OT)/vasopressin (VP) system. However, the role of the OT/VP system has been studied only in parent-offspring bonds and pair-bonds and is lacking in male-male affiliative relationships. In this study, we found the 2-week cohabitation of three male crows in an aviary facilitated affiliative relationship formation between two of the three crows (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of peripheral administration of vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist peripheral administration on the social behaviour of affiliated males. We found that the V1aR antagonist caused the disappearance of affiliative behaviour and the resurgence of agonistic behaviour in affiliated males. Our findings provide the first evidence for V1aR involvement in male-male affiliative relationships in vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Apathy is a complex psychiatric syndrome characterised by motivational deficit, emotional blunting and cognitive changes. It occurs alongside a broad range of neurological disorders, but also occurs in otherwise healthy ageing. Despite its clinical prevalence, apathy does not yet have a designated treatment strategy. Generation of a translational animal model of apathy syndrome would facilitate the development of novel treatments. Given the multidimensional nature of apathy, a model cannot be achieved with a single behavioural test. Using a battery of behavioural tests we investigated whether aged rats exhibit behavioural deficits across different domains relevant to apathy.

Using the effort for reward and progressive ratio tasks we found that aged rats (21-27 months) show intact reward motivation. Using the novelty supressed feeding test and position-based object exploration we found aged rats showed increased anxiety-like behaviour inconsistent with emotional blunting. The sucrose preference test and reward learning assay showed intact reward sensitivity and reward-related cognition in aged rats. However, using a bowl-digging version of the probabilistic reversal learning task, we found a deficit in cognitive flexibility in aged rats that did not translate across to a touchscreen version of the task.

While these data reveal important changes in cognitive flexibility and anxiety associated with ageing, aged rats do not show deficits across other behavioural domains relevant to apathy. This suggests that aged rats are not a suitable model for age-related apathy syndrome. These findings contrast with previous work in mice, revealing important species differences in behaviours relevant to apathy syndrome in ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vocal communication is a major component of animal social behavior. Vocalizations can be learned or innate, and can convey a variety of signals, including territorial limits, the presence of predators, or courtship intent. Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a promising model in which to study mammalian vocal production circuits. While mouse USVs are innate, mice still show complex vocal behavior, including production of structured song composed of multiple syllable types and the ability to modify their vocal rate and syllable repertoire based on social conditions. Though in courtship interactions male mice produce the majority of the emitted USVs, female mice are capable of emitting USVs. In order to study the underlying mechanisms of vocal production in freely behaving pairs of mice, it is necessary to identify the individual responsible for each syllable in group settings. Previous methods to identify the source of an individual USVs have used high-density microphone arrays and triangulation methods, which involve the use of multiple costly microphones and require implementation of complex computational methods. Here we identified, developed, and used an inexpensive, mountable, ultrasound-sensitive miniature-microphone system to record and identify USVs from individual mice during dual socializing behavior. Our system includes custom circuit boards that can be fitted to individual mice and connected to a variety of existing USV recording systems. We found that these miniature microphones reliably detected mouse USVs, and that a high percentage (90%) of vocalizations could be attributed to a specific animal in a vocalizing pair based on the relative amplitude differences alone. This simple readout method avoids the implementation of complicated triangulation methods. By pairing this method with simultaneous video recording and automated animal body part and identity tracking, we were able to study and describe the broader courtship behavioral landscape, in which USV production is one component. These results offer a promising, low-cost, and simple method that researchers can implement to study the social vocal communication between at least pairs of vocalizing mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overcoming occlusion and crowding in multi-animal tracking remains challenging. Thus, we aim to introduce virtual marker tracking (vmTracking) as a solution to these problems. This method integrates markerless multi-animal pose estimation, including multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) or Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP), with single-animal tracking techniques, such as DeepLabCut and LEAP. Initially, maDLC or SLEAP is employed to create videos in which the tracking results are labeled as &#34;virtual markers.&#34; Subsequently, these virtual markers are used to ensure consistent animal identification across frames, and the animals are tracked using single-animal tracking. vmTracking significantly reduces the need for manual corrections and the number of annotation frames required for training. It more efficiently improves occlusion and crowding compared with traditional markerless multi-animal tracking, which relies on motion state estimation. The findings of this research have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and dependability of tracking methods used in the analysis of intricate naturalistic and social behaviors in animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most of the research on color vision related behaviors in dogs has involved training the dogs to perform visual discrimination tasks. We investigated the meaning of color to untrained Indian free-ranging dogs (FRDs). Using one-time multi-option choice tests for color preference in 134 adult dogs, we found the dogs to prefer yellow objects over blue or gray ones (p &lt; 0.001, Cramers V = 0.433) while there was no preference between blue and gray (N = 102, p = 0.165). We next pitted a yellow object against a gray object that had food. Here, the dogs ignored the food to approach the yellow object first, both when the food was biscuit (N = 52, p &lt; 0.001, Cramers V = 0.576) and chicken (N = 61, p &lt; 0.001, Cramers V = 0.540), indicating the color preference to be quite strong. Color preference has previously been investigated in many other animals and has implications for behaviors like mate choice and foraging. Our study provides a new perspective into the ecology of Indian FRDs and might have implications for pet dogs as well, if they too show this preference.

HighlightsO_LIIndian free-ranging dogs (FRDs) show preference toward the color yellow over blue and gray.
C_LIO_LIIndian FRDs show no preference between blue and gray colors.
C_LIO_LIAttraction towards a yellow object can be stronger than attraction towards food rewards for Indian FRDs.

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDImpairments in behavioral pattern separation (BPS)--the ability to distinguish between similar contexts or experiences--contribute to memory interference and overgeneralization seen in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, dementia, and age-related cognitive decline. While BPS relies on the dentate gyrus and is sensitive to changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), its significance as a pharmacological target has not been tested.

METHODSIn this study, we applied a human neural stem cell high-throughput screening cascade to identify compounds that increase human neurogenesis. One compound with a favorable profile, RO6871135, was then tested in BPS in mice.

RESULTSChronic treatment with RO6871135, 7.5 mg/kg increased AHN and improved BPS in a fear discrimination task in both young and aged mice. RO6871135 treatment also lowered innate anxiety-like behavior, which was more apparent in mice exposed to chronic corticosterone. Ablation of AHN by hippocampal irradiation supported a neurogenesis-dependent mechanism for RO6871135-induced improvements in BPS. To identify possible mechanisms of action, in vitro and in vivo kinase inhibition and chemical proteomics assays were performed. These tests indicated that RO6871135 inhibited CDK8, CDK11, CaMK2a, CaMK2b, MAP2K6, and GSK3b. An analog compound also demonstrated high affinity for CDK8, CaMK2a, and GSK3b.

CONCLUSIONSThese studies demonstrate a method for empirical identification and preclinical testing of novel neurogenic compounds that can improve BPS, and points to possible novel mechanisms that can be interrogated for the development of new therapies to improve specific endophenotypes such as impaired BPS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to extinguish contextual fear in a changing environment is crucial for animal survival. The  classic neuronal circuit of contextual fear extinction includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus. However, recent data also support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) in this process. Here, we aimed to determine whether the projections from RE to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1) play a role in updating context-dependent memories and to characterize the underlying synaptic processes. We used chemogenetic manipulations and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of RE afferents on synaptic transmission in the dCA1. Next, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice to analyze the RE buttons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by 3D electron microscopy to analyze synaptic changes with nano-scale resolution. Finally, using projection-specific chemogenetic manipulation, we tested the role of the RE[-&amp;gt;]CA1 projection in the classic contextual fear extinction paradigm, as well as in the extinction of aversive and appetitive contextual memories in a close-to-ecological environment of IntelliCages. Overall, our data demonstrate that RE regulates synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 area (SLM). Extinction of contextual fear induces synaptic plasticity in these regions. However, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. Finally, we demonstrate that the RE[-&amp;gt;]dCA1 pathway contributes to updating contextual memories independent of their valence.</p>
