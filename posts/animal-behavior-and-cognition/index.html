M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573441\nRecording the undersea three-dimensional bioacoustic sound field in real-time promises major benefits to marine behavior studies. We describe a novel hydrophone array--the hydroambiphone (HAP)--that adapts ambisonic spatial-audio theory to sound propagation in ocean waters to realize many of these benefits through spatial localization and acoustic immersion. Deploying it to monitor the humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of southeast Alaska demonstrates that HAP recording provides a qualitatively-improved experience of their undersea behaviors; revealing, for example, new aspects of social coordination during bubble-net feeding. On the practical side, spatialized hydrophone recording greatly reduces post-field analytical and computational challenges--such as the \"cocktail party problem\" of distinguishing single sources in a complicated and crowded auditory environment--that are common to field recordings. On the scientific side, comparing the HAPs capabilities to single-hydrophone and nonspatialized recordings yields new insights into the spatial information that allows animals to thrive in complex acoustic environments. Spatialized bioacoustics markedly improves access to the humpbacks undersea acoustic environment and expands our appreciation of their rich vocal lives.\nThe significance of social interactions in synchronized swarming flight in a termite\nAuthors: Mizumoto, N.; Nozaki, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573318\nIn social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this \"swarming\" behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.\nSex- and strain-dependent effects of ageing on sleep and activity patterns in Drosophila\nAuthors: Woodling, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.573701\nThe fruit fly Drosophila is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.\nMoonlight Polarisation Pattern Guides Nocturnal Bull Ants Home\nAuthors: Freas, C. A.; Narendra, A.; Murray, T.; Cheng, K.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.573574\nCelestial cues are used by many animals to orient and navigate their environment. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces a similar pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Polarised moonlights use has, until now, only been demonstrated for straight-line orientation in nocturnal dung beetles. Here we show the first evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by altering the ambient polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we present evidence that the polarised moonlight pattern is being incorporated throughout the night into these ants path integration system for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.\nMCFBM: a behavioral analysis system enabling objective inference of songbirds' attention during social interactions\nAuthors: Fujibayashi, M.; Abe, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573152\nUnderstanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention.\nDual-system free-operant avoidance: extension of a theory\nAuthors: Perez, O. D.; Dickinson, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.24.542134\nOur theory of positively reinforced free-operant behavior (Perez \u0026 Dickinson, 2020) assumes that responding is controlled by 2 systems. One system is sensitive to the correlation between response and reinforcement rates and controls goal-directed behavior, whereas a habitual system learns by reward prediction error. We present an extension of this theory to the aversive domain that explains why free-operant avoidance responding increases with both the experienced rate of negative reinforcement and the difference between this rate and that programmed by the avoidance schedule. The theory also assumes that the habitual component is reinforced by the acquisition of aversive inhibitory properties by the feedback stimuli generated by responding, which then act as safety signals that reinforce habit performance. Our analysis suggests that the distinction between habitual and goal-directed control of rewarded behavior can also be applied to the aversive domain.\nWind Gates Search States in Free Flight\nAuthors: Stupski, S. D.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569086\nFor any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, wind and water currents may not always provide a reliable directional cue [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise \"virtual\" olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped \"sink and circle\" search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and \"anemometric\" turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.\nVocalization Patterns in Laying Hens - An Analysis of Stress-Induced Audio Responses\nAuthors: Neethirajan, S.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573338\nThis study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.\nRapid body colouration change in Oryzias celebensisas a social signal for intraspecific competition\nAuthors: Ueda, R.; Ansai, S.; Takeuchi, H.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573172\nIn some species, such as chameleon and cichlid fish, rapid body colouration changes (within seconds or minutes) serve as visual social signals in male-male competition. This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.\nSubstantial decline of phasic dopamine signaling in senescent male rats does not impact dopamine-dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\nAuthors: Sandberg, S. G.; Stanford, C. A.; Phillips, P. E. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572806\nNormal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recording the undersea three-dimensional bioacoustic sound field in real-time promises major benefits to marine behavior studies. We describe a novel hydrophone array--the hydroambiphone (HAP)--that adapts ambisonic spatial-audio theory to sound propagation in ocean waters to realize many of these benefits through spatial localization and acoustic immersion. Deploying it to monitor the humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of southeast Alaska demonstrates that HAP recording provides a qualitatively-improved experience of their undersea behaviors; revealing, for example, new aspects of social coordination during bubble-net feeding. On the practical side, spatialized hydrophone recording greatly reduces post-field analytical and computational challenges--such as the &#34;cocktail party problem&#34; of distinguishing single sources in a complicated and crowded auditory environment--that are common to field recordings. On the scientific side, comparing the HAPs capabilities to single-hydrophone and nonspatialized recordings yields new insights into the spatial information that allows animals to thrive in complex acoustic environments. Spatialized bioacoustics markedly improves access to the humpbacks undersea acoustic environment and expands our appreciation of their rich vocal lives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this &#34;swarming&#34; behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Celestial cues are used by many animals to orient and navigate their environment. The sun or moon can provide directional information via their position; however, they can often be obstructed by clouds, canopy or the horizon. Despite being hidden, these bodies can still provide compass information through the polarised light pattern they produce/reflect. Sunlight produces polarised light patterns across the overhead sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarised light is a well-known compass cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces a similar pattern, albeit a million times dimmer than sunlight. Polarised moonlights use has, until now, only been demonstrated for straight-line orientation in nocturnal dung beetles. Here we show the first evidence that polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. Yet many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We demonstrate that bull ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night, by altering the ambient polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we present evidence that the polarised moonlight pattern is being incorporated throughout the night into these ants path integration system for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our theory of positively reinforced free-operant behavior (Perez &amp; Dickinson, 2020) assumes that responding is controlled by 2 systems. One system is sensitive to the correlation between response and reinforcement rates and controls goal-directed behavior, whereas a habitual system learns by reward prediction error. We present an extension of this theory to the aversive domain that explains why free-operant avoidance responding increases with both the experienced rate of negative reinforcement and the difference between this rate and that programmed by the avoidance schedule. The theory also assumes that the habitual component is reinforced by the acquisition of aversive inhibitory properties by the feedback stimuli generated by responding, which then act as safety signals that reinforce habit performance. Our analysis suggests that the distinction between habitual and goal-directed control of rewarded behavior can also be applied to the aversive domain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, wind and water currents may not always provide a reliable directional cue [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise &#34;virtual&#34; olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped &#34;sink and circle&#34; search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and &#34;anemometric&#34; turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In some species, such as chameleon and cichlid fish, rapid body colouration changes (within seconds or minutes) serve as visual social signals in male-male competition. This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.</p>
