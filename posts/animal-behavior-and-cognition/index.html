Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.\nIndividual recognition in a jumping spider (Phidippus regius)\nAuthors: Dahl, C. D.; Cheng, Y.\nScore: 29.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567545\nIndividual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.\nPrimate origins of human event cognition\nAuthors: Wilson, V. A. D.; Sauppe, S.; Brocard, S.; Ringen, E. J.; Daum, M. M.; Wermelinger, S.; Gu, N.; Andrews, C.; Isasi-Isasmendi, A.; Bickel, B.; Zuberbuehler, K.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568086\nHuman language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available. Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.\nExperience reduces reliance on conspecifics for route selection by a collectively migrating soaring bird\nAuthors: Bronnvik, H.; Nourani, E.; Fiedler, W.; Flack, A.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567993\nMigration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.\nStable long-term individual variation in chimpanzee technological efficiency\nAuthors: Berdugo, S.; Cohen, E.; Davis, A. J.; Matsuzawa, T.; Carvalho, S.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568000\nUsing tools to access hard-to-reach and high-quality resources, such as termites, honey, and nuts, initiated a fundamental adaptive shift in human and nonhuman primate cognitive and behavioural evolution. Variation in the efficiency of extracting calorie-rich and nutrient-dense resources directly impacts energy expenditure, and potentially has significant repercussions for cultural transmission where model selection biases are employed during skill acquisition. Assessing variation in efficiency is key to understanding the evolution of complex behavioural traits in primates. Yet, individual-level differences beyond age- and sex-class in primate extractive foraging efficiency have never been investigated. Here, we used 25 years (1992- 2017) of video data of the Bossou chimpanzee community (Guinea), to investigate whether individual differences in nut-cracking efficiency exist across the life span of chimpanzees aged [\u0026ge;] 6 years. Data from 3,882 oil-palm nut-cracking bouts from over 800 hours of observation were collected. We found long-term stable and reliable individual differences in four (out of five) measures of efficiency. We found no sex effect, challenging previous research on a female bias in chimpanzee tool use. These life-long differences in extractive foraging impacts daily energy budgets, which potentially have significant individual fitness and life history consequences. Additionally, the establishment of long-term individual variation in chimpanzee stone tool use has implications for interpreting archaeological records of hominins. Our findings highlight the importance of longitudinal data from long-term field sites when investigating underlying cognitive and behavioural diversity across individual lifespans and between populations.\nIndividuality across environmental context in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Mathejczyk, T.; Knief, C.; Haidar, M. A.; Freitag, F.; McClary, T.; Wernet, M. F.; Linneweber, G. A.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568741\nOver the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain stable over long time periods. The stability of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animals individuality, or personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The ongoing person-situation debate in humans and observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether animal behavior also remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The stability of three individual traits (exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, stability of behavior always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. In summary, our work demonstrates that similar to humans, animal individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments.\nRole of the medial agranular cortex in unilateral spatial neglect\nAuthors: Ishii, D.; Osaki, H.; Yozu, A.; Yamamoto, T.; Yamamoto, S.; Miyata, M.; Kohno, Y.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.24.568203\nUnilateral spatial neglect (USN) results from impaired attentional networks and can affect various sensory modalities, such as visual and somatosensory. The rodent medial agranular cortex (AGm), located in the medial part of the forebrain from rostral to caudal direction, is considered a region associated with spatial attention. The AGm selectively receives multisensory input with the rostral AGm receiving somatosensory input and caudal part receiving visual input. Our previous study showed slower recovery from neglect with anterior AGm lesion using the somatosensory neglect assessment. Conversely, the functional differences in spatial attention across the entire AGm locations (anterior, intermediate, and posterior parts) are unknown. Here, we investigated the relationship between the severity of neglect and various locations across the entire AGm in a mouse stroke model using a newly developed program-based analysis method that does not require human intervention. Among the various lesion positions, acute severity was higher with the lesion in the intermediate rostrocaudal position. On the other hand, the recovery from USN-like behavior after this phase tended to be slower in cases with more rostral lesions in the AGm. Additionally, no motor paralysis was observed in any of the mice with lesions in each AGm. These results suggest that the intermediate rostrocaudal position of the AGm may significantly influence selection of the direction, regardless of the areas to which it is connected. On the contrary, recovery from USN-like behavior may be dependent on the areas to which it is connected. HighlightsLesion of the rodent medial agranular cortex (AGm) results in unilateral spatial neglect (USN). In the acute phase, the severity was higher with lesions in the intermediate AGm position. Recovery from somatosensory USN tended to be slower with rostral AGm lesions. Recovery from USN may depend on sensory modalities associated with the connected areas. Our results revealed location-dependent differences in attentional functions within the AGm.\nPersonality and behavioral syndromes in two species of fruit bats (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae)\nAuthors: Miguel, P. H.; Batisteli, A.; Cruz-Neto, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568433\nPersonality indicates consistency in individual behavioral responses across different contexts, and different personality traits may be correlated in behavioral syndromes. Studies on personality have important consequences for conservation ecology and, despite the ecological relevance of fruit bats, rare studies have tested the existence of personality and behavior syndromes in this group. In this context, this study aims to test whether the Neotropical fruit bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata present (1) individual repeatability (i.e. personality) related to the behaviors: activity, aggressiveness and boldness and (2) correlation between these personality axes, constituting behavioral syndromes. For each species, 27 adult males were captured and immediately placed in cloth bags individually, and we measured aggressiveness as the time they struggled in the bag within a 180-second interval. Bats were then kept in individual cages in a climate-controlled room for 48-h, after which we filmed them for 30 min in a flight tent as an activity test. In the boldness test, we quantified the latency to each animal to start feeding in front of an observer, assuming that bolder individuals had lower latency to feed. All tests were repeated after 48-h to analyze repeatability. We found high individual repeatability of aggressiveness, activity and boldness for both species, but different behavioral syndromes for each of them. For C. perspicillata, the three behaviors were correlated to each other, with the most aggressive individuals being bolder and more active. For A. lituratus, aggressiveness and boldness were also positively correlated, but activity did not correlate with the other two behaviors. Considering these different syndromes, our results suggest that C. perspicillata has less variation in behavioral profiles than A. lituratus probably as a result of species-specific selective pressures. The existence of behavioral syndromes in these frugivorous bats contributes to understanding the importance of individual variation on the ecological functions provided by seed dispersers.\nGeographic variation in the songs of two closely related song-learning species, Anna's and Costa's hummingbird (Calypte anna, C. costae)\nAuthors: Berger, A.; Ye, W.; Padilla, A.; Gumbi, B.; Clark, C.; Campbell, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568754\nIn species that learn their song, cultural transmission of song components can lead to the accumulation of variants that differ among populations, resulting in the formation of dialects. Three avian clades are thought to have independently evolved song learning: parrots, oscine passerines, and hummingbirds. Dialects have mainly been studied in passerines. We extend the study of dialects to the bee hummingbird clade, focusing on Anna's and Costa's hummingbirds (Calypte anna and C. costae). Both species are vocal learners. Anna's produces complex, three phrase, multi-syllable songs and Costa's produces simple, one phrase songs. We recorded 5-24 males per population (5 Costa's and 6 Anna's populations) across the species' ranges in the Western United States and tested for evidence of geographic variation in song. We found minor population differences in frequency measures of Costa's song, but song form was invariant across populations. Anna's song was contrastingly variable with population differences in both syllable use and multiple spectral and temporal measures. The most strongly differentiated Anna's population in our study, Seattle (Washington State), is the product of a recent northward range expansion facilitated by human activities that provide additional food sources for hummingbirds. The loss and modification of syllables in this population is suggestive of a founder effect on song. This study provides insight into song evolution in non-passerine vocal learners and contributes to understanding of how complex signals evolve.\nModerate confirmation bias enhances collective decision-making\nAuthors: Bergerot, C.; Barfuss, W.; Romanczuk, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568073\nHumans tend to give more weight to information confirming their beliefs than to information that disconfirms them. Nevertheless, this apparent irrationality has been shown to improve individual decision-making under uncertainty. However, little is known about this bias impact on collective decision-making. Here, we investigate the conditions under which confirmation bias is beneficial or detrimental to collective decision-making. To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically. We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias affects collective performance on a two-armed bandit task, and how resource scarcity, group size and bias strength modulate this effect. We find that a confirmation bias benefits group learning across a wide range of resource-scarcity conditions. Moreover, we discover that, past a critical bias strength, resource abundance favors the emergence of two different performance regimes, one of which is suboptimal. In addition, we find that this regime bifurcation comes with polarization in small groups of agents. Overall, our results suggest the existence of an optimal, moderate level of confirmation bias for collective decision-making.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Being photosynthetic sessile organisms, plants established heliotropism to track the suns position across the sky and allow their vegetative parts to orient accordingly. Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the  interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Migration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Using tools to access hard-to-reach and high-quality resources, such as termites, honey, and nuts, initiated a fundamental adaptive shift in human and nonhuman primate cognitive and behavioural evolution. Variation in the efficiency of extracting calorie-rich and nutrient-dense resources directly impacts energy expenditure, and potentially has significant repercussions for cultural transmission where model selection biases are employed during skill acquisition. Assessing variation in efficiency is key to understanding the evolution of complex behavioural traits in primates. Yet, individual-level differences beyond age- and sex-class in primate extractive foraging efficiency have never been investigated. Here, we used 25 years (1992- 2017) of video data of the Bossou chimpanzee community (Guinea), to investigate whether individual differences in nut-cracking efficiency exist across the life span of chimpanzees aged [&amp;ge;] 6 years. Data from 3,882 oil-palm nut-cracking bouts from over 800 hours of observation were collected. We found long-term stable and reliable individual differences in four (out of five) measures of efficiency. We found no sex effect, challenging previous research on a female bias in chimpanzee tool use. These life-long differences in extractive foraging impacts daily energy budgets, which potentially have significant individual fitness and life history consequences. Additionally, the establishment of long-term individual variation in chimpanzee stone tool use has implications for interpreting archaeological records of hominins. Our findings highlight the importance of longitudinal data from long-term field sites when investigating underlying cognitive and behavioural diversity across individual lifespans and between populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain stable over long time periods. The stability of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animals individuality, or personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The ongoing  person-situation debate in humans and observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether animal behavior also remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The stability of three individual traits (exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, stability of behavior always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. In summary, our work demonstrates that similar to humans, animal individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) results from impaired attentional networks and can affect various sensory modalities, such as visual and somatosensory. The rodent medial agranular cortex (AGm), located in the medial part of the forebrain from rostral to caudal direction, is considered a region associated with spatial attention. The AGm selectively receives multisensory input with the rostral AGm receiving somatosensory input and caudal part receiving visual input. Our previous study showed slower recovery from neglect with anterior AGm lesion using the somatosensory neglect assessment. Conversely, the functional differences in spatial attention across the entire AGm locations (anterior, intermediate, and posterior parts) are unknown. Here, we investigated the relationship between the severity of neglect and various locations across the entire AGm in a mouse stroke model using a newly developed program-based analysis method that does not require human intervention. Among the various lesion positions, acute severity was higher with the lesion in the intermediate rostrocaudal position. On the other hand, the recovery from USN-like behavior after this phase tended to be slower in cases with more rostral lesions in the AGm. Additionally, no motor paralysis was observed in any of the mice with lesions in each AGm. These results suggest that the intermediate rostrocaudal position of the AGm may significantly influence selection of the direction, regardless of the areas to which it is connected. On the contrary, recovery from USN-like behavior may be dependent on the areas to which it is connected.

HighlightsLesion of the rodent medial agranular cortex (AGm) results in unilateral spatial neglect (USN).
In the acute phase, the severity was higher with lesions in the intermediate AGm position.
Recovery from somatosensory USN tended to be slower with rostral AGm lesions.
Recovery from USN may depend on sensory modalities associated with the connected areas.
Our results revealed location-dependent differences in attentional functions within the AGm.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Personality indicates consistency in individual behavioral responses across different contexts, and different personality traits may be correlated in behavioral syndromes. Studies on personality have important consequences for conservation ecology and, despite the ecological relevance of fruit bats, rare studies have tested the existence of personality and behavior syndromes in this group. In this context, this study aims to test whether the Neotropical fruit bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata present (1) individual repeatability (i.e. personality) related to the behaviors: activity, aggressiveness and boldness and (2) correlation between these personality axes, constituting behavioral syndromes. For each species, 27 adult males were captured and immediately placed in cloth bags individually, and we measured aggressiveness as the time they struggled in the bag within a 180-second interval. Bats were then kept in individual cages in a climate-controlled room for 48-h, after which we filmed them for 30 min in a flight tent as an activity test. In the boldness test, we quantified the latency to each animal to start feeding in front of an observer, assuming that bolder individuals had lower latency to feed. All tests were repeated after 48-h to analyze repeatability. We found high individual repeatability of aggressiveness, activity and boldness for both species, but different behavioral syndromes for each of them. For C. perspicillata, the three behaviors were correlated to each other, with the most aggressive individuals being bolder and more active. For A. lituratus, aggressiveness and boldness were also positively correlated, but activity did not correlate with the other two behaviors. Considering these different syndromes, our results suggest that C. perspicillata has less variation in behavioral profiles than A. lituratus probably as a result of species-specific selective pressures. The existence of behavioral syndromes in these frugivorous bats contributes to understanding the importance of individual variation on the ecological functions provided by seed dispersers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In species that learn their song, cultural transmission of song components can lead to the accumulation of variants that differ among populations, resulting in the formation of dialects. Three avian clades are thought to have independently evolved song learning: parrots, oscine passerines, and hummingbirds. Dialects have mainly been studied in passerines. We extend the study of dialects to the bee hummingbird clade, focusing on Anna&#39;s and Costa&#39;s hummingbirds (Calypte anna and C. costae). Both species are vocal learners. Anna&#39;s produces complex, three phrase, multi-syllable songs and Costa&#39;s produces simple, one phrase songs. We recorded 5-24 males per population (5 Costa&#39;s and 6 Anna&#39;s populations) across the species&#39; ranges in the Western United States and tested for evidence of geographic variation in song. We found minor population differences in frequency measures of Costa&#39;s song, but song form was invariant across populations. Anna&#39;s song was contrastingly variable with population differences in both syllable use and multiple spectral and temporal measures. The most strongly differentiated Anna&#39;s population in our study, Seattle (Washington State), is the product of a recent northward range expansion facilitated by human activities that provide additional food sources for hummingbirds. The loss and modification of syllables in this population is suggestive of a founder effect on song. This study provides insight into song evolution in non-passerine vocal learners and contributes to understanding of how complex signals evolve.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Humans tend to give more weight to information confirming their beliefs than to information that disconfirms them. Nevertheless, this apparent irrationality has been shown to improve individual decision-making under uncertainty. However, little is known about this bias impact on collective decision-making. Here, we investigate the conditions under which confirmation bias is beneficial or detrimental to collective decision-making. To do so, we develop a Collective Asymmetric Reinforcement Learning (CARL) model in which artificial agents observe others actions and rewards, and update this information asymmetrically. We use agent-based simulations to study how confirmation bias affects collective performance on a two-armed bandit task, and how resource scarcity, group size and bias strength modulate this effect. We find that a confirmation bias benefits group learning across a wide range of resource-scarcity conditions. Moreover, we discover that, past a critical bias strength, resource abundance favors the emergence of two different performance regimes, one of which is suboptimal. In addition, we find that this regime bifurcation comes with polarization in small groups of agents. Overall, our results suggest the existence of an optimal, moderate level of confirmation bias for collective decision-making.</p>
