K.\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558032\nAnimals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics. Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.\nThe contribution of movement to social network structure and spreading dynamics under simple and complex transmission\nAuthors: Chimento, M.; Farine, D. R.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579705\nThe structure of social networks fundamentally influences spreading dynamics. In general, the more contact between individuals, the more opportunity there is for transmission to take place. Yet, contact between individuals, and any resulting transmission events, are determined by a combination of spatial (where individuals choose to move) and social rules (who they choose to interact with or learn from). Here we examine the effect of the social-spatial interface on spreading dynamics using a simulation model. We quantify the relative effects of different movement rules (localized, semi-localized, nomadic, and resource-based movement) and social transmission rules (simple transmission, anti-conformity, proportional, conformity, and threshold rules) to both the structure of social networks and spread of a novel behaviour. Localized movement created weakly connected sparse networks, nomadic movement created weakly connected dense networks, and resource-based movement generated strongly connected modular networks. The resulting rate of spreading varied with different combinations of movement and transmission rules, but---importantly---the relative rankings of transmission rules changed when running simulations on static versus dynamic representations of networks. Our results emphasize that bottom-up social and spatial behaviours influence emergent network structure, and are of particular consequence for the spread of information under complex transmission rules.\nUnravelling the microplastic menace: different polymers work in synergy to increase bee vulnerability\nAuthors: Ferrante, F.; Pasquini, E.; Cappa, F.; Bellocchio, L.; Baracchi, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579429\nMicroplastics (MPs) are growing and ubiquitous environmental pollutants and represent one of the greatest contemporary challenges caused by human activities. Current research has predominantly examined the singular toxicological effects of individual polymers, neglecting the prevailing reality of organisms confronted with complex contaminant mixtures and potential synergistic effects. To fill this research gap, we investigated the lethal and sublethal effects of two common MPs, polystyrene (PS - 4.8-5.8 m) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA - 1-40 m), and their combination (MIX), on the pollinating insect Apis mellifera. For each treatment, we evaluated the oral toxicity of two ecologically relevant and one higher concentration (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L) and analysed their effects on the immune system and worker survival. As immune activation can alter the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of honey bees, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to investigate whether MPs lead to changes in the chemical profile of foragers and behavioural assay to test whether such changes affect behavioural patterns of social recognition, undermining overall colony integrity. The results indicate a synergistic negative effect of PS and PMMA on bee survival and immune response, even at ecologically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, alterations in cuticle profiles were observed with both MPs at the highest and intermediate concentrations, with PMMA being mainly responsible. Both MPs exposure resulted in a reduction in the abundance of several cuticular compounds. Hive entry guards did not show increased inspection or aggressive behaviour towards exposed foragers, allowing them to enter the colony without being treated differently from uncontaminated foragers. These findings raise concerns not only for the health of individual bees, but also for the entire colony, which could be at risk if contaminated nestmates enter the colony undetected, allowing MPs to spread throughout the hive.\nvmTracking: Virtual Markers Overcome Occlusion and Crowding in Multi-Animal Pose Tracking\nAuthors: Azechi, H.; Takahashi, S.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.07.579241\nOvercoming occlusion and crowding in multi-animal tracking remains challenging. Thus, we aim to introduce virtual marker tracking (vmTracking) as a solution to these problems. This method integrates markerless multi-animal pose estimation, including multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) or Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP), with single-animal tracking techniques, such as DeepLabCut and LEAP. Initially, maDLC or SLEAP is employed to create videos in which the tracking results are labeled as \"virtual markers.\" Subsequently, these virtual markers are used to ensure consistent animal identification across frames, and the animals are tracked using single-animal tracking. vmTracking significantly reduces the need for manual corrections and the number of annotation frames required for training. It more efficiently improves occlusion and crowding compared with traditional markerless multi-animal tracking, which relies on motion state estimation. The findings of this research have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and dependability of tracking methods used in the analysis of intricate naturalistic and social behaviors in animals.\nPredator cues and environmental enrichment during development drive intraspecific variation in the behaviour and life-history of juvenile lobsters\nAuthors: Polverino, G.; Latini, L.; Nascetti, G.; Grignani, G.; Bello, E.; Gili, C.; Carere, C.; Canestrelli, D.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.10.578266\nIntraspecific variation in ecologically relevant traits is critical for animal populations to survive in our rapidly changing world. This is especially true for species that suffer from intense harvesting regimes, whereby populations density is often low. Standard hatchery procedures can assist some management and conservation programs by producing large numbers of juveniles to be released into the wild. Yet we know surprisingly little on the impact that such standard, minimalistic settings have on the development of intraspecific variation in important phenotypes of the individuals, including among-individual variation in behavioural (individuality) and life-history traits, and in the plasticity of those traits in response to varying environmental conditions. Here, we fill this gap by testing whether early-life exposure to different environmental conditions alters the development of individuality and plasticity in ecologically relevant behaviours and life-history traits of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus)--one the most harvested species in the Mediterranean, which has been subjected to conservation programs for decades. By accessing one of the largest lobsters hatcheries in Italy, we used the progeny of wild-caught females and manipulated--in a full factorial design--the environmental complexity of the individual enclosures (i.e. presence/absence of substrate and/or shelter) and the level of exposure to cues from their natural predators. We repeatedly quantified behaviours (i.e. activity, refuge use, and aggressiveness) and life-history traits (i.e. carapace length and intermoult period) of the individuals throughout their early development, capturing both mean and individual-level variation across treatments. Our results offer solid evidence that effects of standard hatchery settings extend far beyond mean changes in the behaviour and life history of the animals, compromising the development of individual plasticity in those traits that are essentials for populations to survive in the wild--likely reducing the effectiveness of conservation programs.\nInnate floral object identification in the generalist solitary hoverfly pollinator Eristalinus aeneus\nAuthors: Mishra, A.; Jain, A.; Iyer, P. S.; Suryanarayanan, A.; Nordstrom, K.; Olsson, S. B.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579518\nAll animals must locate and identify food for their survival. Most insects are solitary. Newly emerged solitary insects must therefore employ innate identification of food cues to locate relevant nutritive objects from a distance. Innate preferences for food cues should be both specific enough to allow discrimination between food and non-food objects and general enough to allow for the variety of food objects relevant to each species ecology. How insects with small nervous systems are able to encode these cues innately is an area of intense study for ecologists and neuroscientists alike. Here, we used the solitary generalist pollinator Eristalinus aeneus to understand how the innate search template used to identify multiple floral species can arise through a small number of sensory cues spanning multiple modalities. We found that innate floral choices of the hoverfly E. aeneus are a product of contextual integration of broad, plant-based olfactory cues and visual cues, where a combination of radial symmetry and reflection in the 500-700 nm wavelength range was particularly important. Our study, therefore, shows how tiny brains can efficiently encode multimodal cues to identify multiple relevant objects without prior experience.\nNoxious stimulation induces self-protective behaviour in bumblebees\nAuthors: Gibbons, M.; Pasquini, E.; Kowalewska, A.; Read, E.; Gibson, S.; Crump, A.; Solvi, C.; Versace, E.; Chittka, L.\nScore: 150.4, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575734\nSelf-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nUngulate substrate selection in fauna passages\nAuthors: Helldin, J. O.; Niemi, M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579517\nFauna passages are increasingly constructed at major roads and railways to mitigate the negative effects of infrastructure and traffic on wildlife. The function of such passages depends on their design, including the construction materials, soil and vegetation. Providing \"naturalness\" in fauna passages may entail significant costs, yet its benefits are incompletely understood. In particular, there is a demand for better knowledge support regarding combining passages for large fauna with minor roads, trails and watercourses. By using camera trap data collected across the passages, we examined ungulate substrate selection in seven passages serving both fauna and local roads (overpasses) and fauna and watercourses (underpasses) in boreal Sweden and Finland. While all substrates were used, during snow-free periods, ungulates used smoother surfaces (fine-grained topsoil, grass, artificial fiber mat, and dirt road) more than expected based on their availability. Coarser surface (stony/rocky ground), shrub, and water were used less than expected. The results for road and water were however inconsistent between passages; in one overpass road was instead used less than expected, and in one underpass the water section was used particularly during winter (ice cover) but also by moose wading or swimming through in summer and autumn. The general patterns of use largely remained when we analysed data on species level, although these analyses were restricted because of limited sample sizes. While our study has several limitations, it offers valuable insights for the planning and construction of fauna passages. To our knowledge, this study was the first of its kind to study the substrate preferences of ungulates in fauna passages, and we suggest to conduct further research in the field.\nWildPose: A Long-Range 3D wildlife motion capture system\nAuthors: Muramatsu, N.; Shin, S.; Deng, Q.; Markham, A.; Patel, A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578861\nUnderstanding and monitoring wildlife behavior is crucial in ecology and biomechanics, yet challenging due to the limitations of current methods. To address this issue, we introduce WildPose, a novel long-range motion capture system specifically tailored for free-ranging wildlife observation. This system combines a electronically controllable zoom-lens camera with a solid-state LiDAR to capture both 2D videos and 3D point cloud data, thereby allowing researchers to observe high-fidelity animal morphometrics, behavior and interactions in a completely remote manner. Field trials conducted in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park have successfully demonstrated WildPoses ability to quantify morphological features of different species, accurately track the 3D movements of a springbok herd over time, and observe the respiratory patterns of a distant lion. By facilitating non-intrusive, long-range 3D data collection, WildPose marks a significant leap forward in ecological and biomechanical studies, offering new possibilities for conservation efforts and animal welfare, and enriching the prospects for interdisciplinary research.\nFine-scale tracking reveals visual field use for predator detection and escape in collective foraging of pigeon flocks\nAuthors: Delacoux, M.; Kano, F.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578919\nDuring collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator \"detection\", particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Animals have myriad adaptations to help them hunt and feed in the most efficient and effective manner. One mysterious behavior related to hunting and feeding is the posterior toe tapping behavior of some frogs. Biologists and hobbyists alike have long noticed this behavior, but there is little empirical data to explain its causes and consequences. To test the hypothesis that tapping is related to feeding and modulated by environmental context, we conducted a series of related experiments in the Dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius. We reasoned that mechanostimulation of prey by vibrational stimuli from tapping might induce prey movement and thereby facilitate prey detection by frogs. We first confirmed that tap rate was higher during feeding as has been observed in other species. Interestingly, this effect was heightened in the presence of a conspecific. We next asked whether frogs tapped less under conditions when vibrational contact between frogs and prey was not possible. Finally, we asked whether D. tinctorius tap more on more vibrationally responsive surfaces and whether prey capture success was higher when tapping. In addition to confirming an association between tapping and feeding, our work demonstrates modulation of toe tapping based on social context, prey accessibility, and substrate characteristics.

Significance StatementThe toe tapping of some amphibians is an intriguing behavior that has attracted attention from researchers and hobbyists, yet the functional role of toe tapping remains poorly understood. Previous studies have noted an association between toe tapping and feeding in other species, and our work does so quantitatively and experimentally in Dyeing poison frogs, Dendrobates tinctorius. We demonstrate that frogs modulate tap rate based on the presence of conspecifics, prey accessibility, and substrate type. We suggest tapping may act as a vibrational stimulus to facilitate prey detection and capture alongside other functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The structure of social networks fundamentally influences spreading dynamics. In general, the more contact between individuals, the more opportunity there is for transmission to take place. Yet, contact between individuals, and any resulting transmission events, are determined by a combination of spatial (where individuals choose to move) and social rules (who they choose to interact with or learn from). Here we examine the effect of the social-spatial interface on spreading dynamics using a simulation model. We quantify the relative effects of different movement rules (localized, semi-localized, nomadic, and resource-based movement) and social transmission rules (simple transmission, anti-conformity, proportional, conformity, and threshold rules) to both the structure of social networks and spread of a novel behaviour. Localized movement created weakly connected sparse networks, nomadic movement created weakly connected dense networks, and resource-based movement generated strongly connected modular networks. The resulting rate of spreading varied with different combinations of movement and transmission rules, but---importantly---the relative rankings of transmission rules changed when running simulations on static versus dynamic representations of networks. Our results emphasize that bottom-up social and spatial behaviours influence emergent network structure, and are of particular consequence for the spread of information under complex transmission rules.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microplastics (MPs) are growing and ubiquitous environmental pollutants and represent one of the greatest contemporary challenges caused by human activities. Current research has predominantly examined the singular toxicological effects of individual polymers, neglecting the prevailing reality of organisms confronted with complex contaminant mixtures and potential synergistic effects. To fill this research gap, we investigated the lethal and sublethal effects of two common MPs, polystyrene (PS - 4.8-5.8 m) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA - 1-40 m), and their combination (MIX), on the pollinating insect Apis mellifera. For each treatment, we evaluated the oral toxicity of two ecologically relevant and one higher concentration (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/L) and analysed their effects on the immune system and worker survival. As immune activation can alter the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of honey bees, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to investigate whether MPs lead to changes in the chemical profile of foragers and behavioural assay to test whether such changes affect behavioural patterns of social recognition, undermining overall colony integrity. The results indicate a synergistic negative effect of PS and PMMA on bee survival and immune response, even at ecologically relevant concentrations. Furthermore, alterations in cuticle profiles were observed with both MPs at the highest and intermediate concentrations, with PMMA being mainly responsible. Both MPs exposure resulted in a reduction in the abundance of several cuticular compounds. Hive entry guards did not show increased inspection or aggressive behaviour towards exposed foragers, allowing them to enter the colony without being treated differently from uncontaminated foragers. These findings raise concerns not only for the health of individual bees, but also for the entire colony, which could be at risk if contaminated nestmates enter the colony undetected, allowing MPs to spread throughout the hive.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Overcoming occlusion and crowding in multi-animal tracking remains challenging. Thus, we aim to introduce virtual marker tracking (vmTracking) as a solution to these problems. This method integrates markerless multi-animal pose estimation, including multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) or Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP), with single-animal tracking techniques, such as DeepLabCut and LEAP. Initially, maDLC or SLEAP is employed to create videos in which the tracking results are labeled as &#34;virtual markers.&#34; Subsequently, these virtual markers are used to ensure consistent animal identification across frames, and the animals are tracked using single-animal tracking. vmTracking significantly reduces the need for manual corrections and the number of annotation frames required for training. It more efficiently improves occlusion and crowding compared with traditional markerless multi-animal tracking, which relies on motion state estimation. The findings of this research have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and dependability of tracking methods used in the analysis of intricate naturalistic and social behaviors in animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intraspecific variation in ecologically relevant traits is critical for animal populations to survive in our rapidly changing world. This is especially true for species that suffer from intense harvesting regimes, whereby populations density is often low. Standard hatchery procedures can assist some management and conservation programs by producing large numbers of juveniles to be released into the wild. Yet we know surprisingly little on the impact that such standard, minimalistic settings have on the development of intraspecific variation in important phenotypes of the individuals, including among-individual variation in behavioural (individuality) and life-history traits, and in the plasticity of those traits in response to varying environmental conditions. Here, we fill this gap by testing whether early-life exposure to different environmental conditions alters the development of individuality and plasticity in ecologically relevant behaviours and life-history traits of the European lobster (Homarus gammarus)--one the most harvested species in the Mediterranean, which has been subjected to conservation programs for decades. By accessing one of the largest lobsters hatcheries in Italy, we used the progeny of wild-caught females and manipulated--in a full factorial design--the environmental complexity of the individual enclosures (i.e. presence/absence of substrate and/or shelter) and the level of exposure to cues from their natural predators. We repeatedly quantified behaviours (i.e. activity, refuge use, and aggressiveness) and life-history traits (i.e. carapace length and intermoult period) of the individuals throughout their early development, capturing both mean and individual-level variation across treatments. Our results offer solid evidence that effects of standard hatchery settings extend far beyond mean changes in the behaviour and life history of the animals, compromising the development of individual plasticity in those traits that are essentials for populations to survive in the wild--likely reducing the effectiveness of conservation programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">All animals must locate and identify food for their survival. Most insects are solitary. Newly emerged solitary insects must therefore employ innate identification of food cues to locate relevant nutritive objects from a distance. Innate preferences for food cues should be both specific enough to allow discrimination between food and non-food objects and general enough to allow for the variety of food objects relevant to each species ecology. How insects with small nervous systems are able to encode these cues innately is an area of intense study for ecologists and neuroscientists alike. Here, we used the solitary generalist pollinator Eristalinus aeneus to understand how the innate search template used to identify multiple floral species can arise through a small number of sensory cues spanning multiple modalities. We found that innate floral choices of the hoverfly E. aeneus are a product of contextual integration of broad, plant-based olfactory cues and visual cues, where a combination of radial symmetry and reflection in the 500-700 nm wavelength range was particularly important. Our study, therefore, shows how tiny brains can efficiently encode multimodal cues to identify multiple relevant objects without prior experience.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fauna passages are increasingly constructed at major roads and railways to mitigate the negative effects of infrastructure and traffic on wildlife. The function of such passages depends on their design, including the construction materials, soil and vegetation. Providing &#34;naturalness&#34; in fauna passages may entail significant costs, yet its benefits are incompletely understood. In particular, there is a demand for better knowledge support regarding combining passages for large fauna with minor roads, trails and watercourses. By using camera trap data collected across the passages, we examined ungulate substrate selection in seven passages serving both fauna and local roads (overpasses) and fauna and watercourses (underpasses) in boreal Sweden and Finland. While all substrates were used, during snow-free periods, ungulates used smoother surfaces (fine-grained topsoil, grass, artificial fiber mat, and dirt road) more than expected based on their availability. Coarser surface (stony/rocky ground), shrub, and water were used less than expected. The results for road and water were however inconsistent between passages; in one overpass road was instead used less than expected, and in one underpass the water section was used particularly during winter (ice cover) but also by moose wading or swimming through in summer and autumn. The general patterns of use largely remained when we analysed data on species level, although these analyses were restricted because of limited sample sizes. While our study has several limitations, it offers valuable insights for the planning and construction of fauna passages. To our knowledge, this study was the first of its kind to study the substrate preferences of ungulates in fauna passages, and we suggest to conduct further research in the field.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding and monitoring wildlife behavior is crucial in ecology and biomechanics, yet challenging due to the limitations of current methods. To address this issue, we introduce WildPose, a novel long-range motion capture system specifically tailored for free-ranging wildlife observation. This system combines a electronically controllable zoom-lens camera with a solid-state LiDAR to capture both 2D videos and 3D point cloud data, thereby allowing researchers to observe high-fidelity animal morphometrics, behavior and interactions in a completely remote manner. Field trials conducted in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park have successfully demonstrated WildPoses ability to quantify morphological features of different species, accurately track the 3D movements of a springbok herd over time, and observe the respiratory patterns of a distant lion. By facilitating non-intrusive, long-range 3D data collection, WildPose marks a significant leap forward in ecological and biomechanical studies, offering new possibilities for conservation efforts and animal welfare, and enriching the prospects for interdisciplinary research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator &#34;detection&#34;, particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.</p>
