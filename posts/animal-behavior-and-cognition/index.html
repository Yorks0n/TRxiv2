S.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550661\nDopaminergic neurons (DANs) carry out multiple tasks in the brain, including the transmission of information related to rewards and punishments across various animal species. They are responsible for evaluating sensory input, storing resultant associations as memory, and continuously updating them based on their relevance and reliability. Accurate comprehension of the dopaminergic system's operation necessitates an understanding of the specific functions mediated by individual DANs. To this end, our research employs Drosophila larvae, which possess approximately 12,000 neurons in their brains, of which only around 1% (approximately 120) are DANs. The presynaptic projections to the mushroom body (MB) - a brain region pivotal for associative olfactory learning in insects - are limited to only eight larval dopaminergic neurons. These DANs are further subdivided into two clusters: the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) comprises four cells, and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1) comprises the remaining four cells. Our findings confirm previous research that demonstrates that the pPAM DANs innervating the MB's medial lobe encode for a gustatory sugar reward signal. Furthermore, we have identified four DANs in the DL1 cluster - DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 - each of which innervates distinct compartments of the MB peduncle, lateral appendix, and vertical lobe. Optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 alone suffices to substitute for salt punishment. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition, calcium imaging results and electron microscopy-based reconstruction of all sensory input circuits to the four DL1 DANs demonstrate that each DAN encodes a different aspect of salt punishment, with DAN-g1 being of central importance. To summarize, our investigation has revealed the existence of a cellular division of labor among larval DANs concerning the transmission of dopaminergic reward (pPAM cluster) and punishment signals (DL1 cluster). Individual DANs in each cluster encode for distinct but partially overlapping aspects of the teaching signal. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.\nInterpersonal heart rate synchrony predicts effective group performance in a naturalistic collective decision-making task\nAuthors: Sharika, K. M.; Thaikkandi, S.; Nivedita, ; Platt, M.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550277\nGroups often outperform individuals in problem-solving. However, failure of group members to critically evaluate ideas in a discussion risks sub-optimal outcomes - a phenomenon called \"groupthink\". While recent studies have found interpersonal physiological synchrony to correlate with shared attention and group cohesion, whether it can track group efficacy in a collective decision-making task with an objectively defined performance measure remains controversial. To address this gap, we collected heart rate data from 58 groups (n=271) performing a task based on the hidden profile paradigm. Using multi-dimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA) and machine learning, we found that heart rate synchrony predicted the probability of groups overriding groupthink and reaching correct consensus with more than 70% cross-validation accuracy--significantly higher than that predicted by subjective assessment of team function or baseline heart rates alone. These findings demonstrate that heart rate synchrony during a naturalistic group discussion could be a biomarker of effective collective decision-making.\nModelling collective behavior in groups of mice housed under semi-naturalistic conditions\nAuthors: Chen, X.; Winiarski, M.; Puscian, A.; Knapska, E.; Mora, T.; Walczak, A. M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550619\nSocial interactions are a crucial aspect of behavior in mice. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to distinguish the effects of interactions, from independent animal behavior. Distinguishing interactions from individual preferences is important to describe how information is transmitted in a horde and to predict behavioral patterns of a whole group. We combine high-throughput data collected in mice housed and location-tracked over multiple days in an ecologically-relevant environment (Eco-HAB system) with statistical inference models to learn the rules controlling the collective dynamics of groups of 10 to 15 individuals. We reproduce the distribution for the co-localization patterns, show they are stable over time, and find that the distribution of the inferred interaction strength captures the social structure among the animals. By separating interactions from individual preferences, we show that affecting neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex - a brain structure crucial for processing social information and interacting with others - does not eliminate social interactions, yet make it harder to transmit information between mice.\nReciprocal social ties drive stability within a social network\nAuthors: Dakin, R.; Clunis, P.; Cornthwaite, E.; Ryder, T. B.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2020.11.06.371567\nSocial reciprocity is thought to be the most important driver of cooperation among non-kin, but its effects within complex social networks where individuals choose their partners have not been studied. Here, we test whether reciprocation can explain social dynamics in a bird species where males form coalitions to court females, the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda). In our study population, approximately a third of male-male social interactions involve one male leaving his territory to interact and display with the owner of another territory; this directional behaviour provides benefits to the recipient at a cost to the visiting male. We characterize social ties among pairs of territory holders according to the directionality of their interactions, and show here that territory holding males engaged in far more reciprocated (bidirectional) partnerships with other territory holders than expected by chance. Reciprocated partnerships were also stronger (i.e., the partners interacted more frequently) than non-reciprocated partnerships, controlling for spatial proximity of the territories. An individual-level analysis revealed that a males social contribution to a given partner was predictive of the number of social interactions he received from that same partner. Finally, we show that reciprocation predicted the long-term stability of social partnerships one year later. Together, these results demonstrate that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks where partner choice is flexible. LAY SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhen animals are free to choose their partners, how does reciprocity influence social dynamics?C_ST_ABSIn the wire-tailed manakin, males form coalitions with other males to help attract mates. We tracked male social networks and found that some males form reciprocal partnerships where each male leaves its territory to display at the others territory. These bidirectional partnerships are particularly strong and stable, indicating that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks.\nHummingbirds use wing inertial effects to improve maneuverability\nAuthors: Haque, M. N.; Cheng, B.; Tobalske, B. W.; Luo, H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-07-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550104\nHummingbirds outperform other birds in terms of aerial agility at low flight speeds. To reveal the key mechanisms that enable such unparalleled agility, we reconstructed body and wing motion of hummingbird escape maneuvers from high-speed videos; then, we performed computational fluid dynamics modeling and flight mechanics analysis, in which each wingbeat was resolved. We found that the birds utilized the inertia of their wings to achieve peak body rotational acceleration within half a wingbeat before the aerodynamic forces became dominant. The aerodynamic forces instead counteracted the reversed inertial forces in the other half wingbeat, thereby to sustain body rotation, albeit at a lower acceleration. Thus, individual wingbeat cycles that generated body rotations can be split into an agility phase with rapid inertial acceleration, and a stability phase with counteracting aerodynamic and inertial acceleration. This mechanism involving inertial steering enables hummingbirds to generate instantaneous body acceleration at any phase of a wingbeat, and it is likely the key to understanding the unique dexterity distinguishing them from aircraft that solely rely on aerodynamics for maneuvering.\nIndividuals lack the capacity to accurately detect emotional piloerection\nAuthors: McPhetres, J.; Han, A.; Gao, H. H.; Kemp, N.; Khati, B.; Pu, C. X.; Smith, A.; Shui, X.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.19.549671\nPiloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being \"emotionally moved\" and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance. Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.\nGenetic variations in foraging habits and their developmental noise in Drosophila\nAuthors: Hamamichi, K.; Takahashi, Y.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550901\nInvestigating the causes and consequences of niche partitioning in populations is a significant goal in ecology and evolutionary biology. Studies have examined genetic and environmentally induced variations in resource utility and their ecological implications. However, few have explored developmental noise or instability as a factor contributing to variation in resource utility. Here, we studied genetic variation, and developmental noise in foraging traits of Drosophila lutescens, a wild fruit fly. Using 70 iso-female lines from a single population, we observed two foraging behavior traits - locomotive activity and resource preferences - in an experimental 8-shaped arena with two different fruit juices in each chamber. The mean locomotive speed and relative preference for orange juice over grape juice varied significantly among iso-female lines, indicating genetic variation in foraging behavior. Additionally, the degree of variation within iso-female lines also varied, showing relatively higher heritability. While the locomotive speed and resource preferences of each line did not correlate with each other, the strength of variation within iso-female lines for locomotive speed showed a significant correlation with that for resource preferences. This suggests that the degree of developmental noise in both locomotive activity and resource preferences is governed by a shared genetic basis. Consequently, developmental noise can contribute to increased phenotypic variation in resource utility within a population and may evolve through natural selection.\nUnravelling vulture avoidance tactic of wind turbines combining empirical and simulation data\nAuthors: Sassi, Y.; Ziletti, N.; Duriez, O.; Robira, B.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550651\nThe increase of wind turbine installations to limit climate change may affect bird populations because of collisions with rotor blades. Birds may respond to wind turbine presence along a gradient of behavioural changes: avoiding the wind farm (macro-scale) or only the wind turbines either by anticipating wind turbine locations (meso-scale) or engaging into last-minute flee attempts after late perception (micro-scale). We investigated the flight response at these three spatial scales of 25 adult griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) equipped with GPS tags over three years when flying in an area including ten wind farms in the Causses, France. At macro-scale, the population foraging range and habitat use revealed that vultures did not avoid wind farms. To investigate avoidance at meso- and micro-scales we focused on the four mostly visited wind farms. We compared vulture flights to null movement models, based on a method allowing us to keep the correlation between flights and topography while creating movement independent of wind turbine locations. At most sites, vultures did not show avoidance behaviour. Yet, simulations from our agent-based model highlighted that the avoidance pattern detected at one wind farm matched with an anticipated avoidance of turbines, probably linked to the presence of a ridge nearby. Overall, our results suggest wind farm-specific responses by soaring birds as a function of the landscape topography. Thus, stakeholders should carefully consider the wind farm location for siting and designing preventive measures (e.g. improve detection of species not able to avoid turbines in switching off on-demand technologies) to reduce collision risk of soaring birds.\nEmotional state dynamics impacts temporal memory\nAuthors: Wang, J.; Lapate, R. C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550412\nEmotional fluctuations are ubiquitous in everyday life, but precisely how they sculpt the temporal organization of memories remains unclear. Here, we designed a novel task-the Emotion Boundary Task-wherein participants viewed sequences of negative and neutral images surrounded by a color border. We manipulated perceptual context (border color), emotional valence, as well as the direction of emotional-valence shifts (i.e., transitions from neutral-to-negative and negative-to-neutral events). We measured memory for temporal order and subjectively remembered temporal distances for images processed within and across events. Negative images processed within events were remembered as closer in time compared to neutral ones. In contrast, temporal distance was remembered as longer for images spanning neutral-to-negative transitions-suggesting temporal dilation in memory with the onset of a negative event following a previously-neutral state. The extent of this negative-picture induced temporal dilation in memory correlated with dispositional negativity across individuals. Lastly, temporal order memory was enhanced for recently presented negative (compared to neutral) images. These findings suggest that emotional-state dynamics matters when considering emotion-temporal memory interactions: While persistent negative events may compress subjectively remembered time, dynamic shifts from neutral to negative events produce temporal dilation in memory, which may be relevant for adaptive emotional functioning.\nThe Role of Vision and Lateral Line Sensing for Schooling in Giant Danios (Devario Aequipinnatus)\nAuthors: Tidswell, B.; Veliko-Shapko, A.; Tytell, E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550510\nTo protect themselves from predators, fishes often form schools with other fish. Previous work has identified abstract \"rules\" of schooling - attraction to neighbours that are far away, repulsion from neighbours that are too close, and alignment with neighbours at the correct distance - but we do not understand well how these rules emerge from the sensory physiology and behaviour of individual fish. In particular, fish use both vision and their lateral lines to sense other fish, but it is unclear how they integrate information from these sensory modalities to coordinate schooling behaviour. To address this question, we studied how the schooling of giant danios (Devario aequipinnatus) changes when they are either unable to see or unable to use their lateral lines. We found that giant danios were able to school normally without their lateral lines, but did not school in darkness. Surprisingly, giant danios in darkness had the same attraction and alignment properties as fish in light, potentially indicating that they do not feel as much risk in darkness. Overall, we suggest that differences among schooling species in sensory integration between vision and lateral line may depend on their natural predators and environment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) carry out multiple tasks in the brain, including the transmission of information related to rewards and punishments across various animal species. They are responsible for evaluating sensory input, storing resultant associations as memory, and continuously updating them based on their relevance and reliability. Accurate comprehension of the dopaminergic system&#39;s operation necessitates an understanding of the specific functions mediated by individual DANs. To this end, our research employs Drosophila larvae, which possess approximately 12,000 neurons in their brains, of which only around 1% (approximately 120) are DANs. The presynaptic projections to the mushroom body (MB) - a brain region pivotal for associative olfactory learning in insects - are limited to only eight larval dopaminergic neurons. These DANs are further subdivided into two clusters: the primary protocerebral anterior medial cluster (pPAM) comprises four cells, and the dorsolateral 1 cluster (DL1) comprises the remaining four cells. Our findings confirm previous research that demonstrates that the pPAM DANs innervating the MB&#39;s medial lobe encode for a gustatory sugar reward signal. Furthermore, we have identified four DANs in the DL1 cluster - DAN-c1, DAN-d1, DAN-f1, and DAN-g1 - each of which innervates distinct compartments of the MB peduncle, lateral appendix, and vertical lobe. Optogenetic activation of DAN-f1 and DAN-g1 alone suffices to substitute for salt punishment. Furthermore, optogenetic inhibition, calcium imaging results and electron microscopy-based reconstruction of all sensory input circuits to the four DL1 DANs demonstrate that each DAN encodes a different aspect of salt punishment, with DAN-g1 being of central importance. To summarize, our investigation has revealed the existence of a cellular division of labor among larval DANs concerning the transmission of dopaminergic reward (pPAM cluster) and punishment signals (DL1 cluster). Individual DANs in each cluster encode for distinct but partially overlapping aspects of the teaching signal. The striking resemblance in the organizing principle of larval DANs with that of its adult counterpart and the mammalian basal ganglion suggests that there may be a limited number of efficient neural circuit solutions available to address more complex cognitive challenges in nature.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Groups often outperform individuals in problem-solving. However, failure of group members to critically evaluate ideas in a discussion risks sub-optimal outcomes - a phenomenon called &#34;groupthink&#34;. While recent studies have found interpersonal physiological synchrony to correlate with shared attention and group cohesion, whether it can track group efficacy in a collective decision-making task with an objectively defined performance measure remains controversial. To address this gap, we collected heart rate data from 58 groups (n=271) performing a task based on the hidden profile paradigm. Using multi-dimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA) and machine learning, we found that heart rate synchrony predicted the probability of groups overriding groupthink and reaching correct consensus with more than 70% cross-validation accuracy--significantly higher than that predicted by subjective assessment of team function or baseline heart rates alone. These findings demonstrate that heart rate synchrony during a naturalistic group discussion could be a biomarker of effective collective decision-making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social interactions are a crucial aspect of behavior in mice. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to distinguish the effects of interactions, from independent animal behavior. Distinguishing interactions from individual preferences is important to describe how information is transmitted in a horde and to predict behavioral patterns of a whole group. We combine high-throughput data collected in mice housed and location-tracked over multiple days in an ecologically-relevant environment (Eco-HAB system) with statistical inference models to learn the rules controlling the collective dynamics of groups of 10 to 15 individuals. We reproduce the distribution for the co-localization patterns, show they are stable over time, and find that the distribution of the inferred interaction strength captures the social structure among the animals. By separating interactions from individual preferences, we show that affecting neuronal plasticity in the prelimbic cortex - a brain structure crucial for processing social information and interacting with others - does not eliminate social interactions, yet make it harder to transmit information between mice.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social reciprocity is thought to be the most important driver of cooperation among non-kin, but its effects within complex social networks where individuals choose their partners have not been studied. Here, we test whether reciprocation can explain social dynamics in a bird species where males form coalitions to court females, the wire-tailed manakin (Pipra filicauda). In our study population, approximately a third of male-male social interactions involve one male leaving his territory to interact and display with the owner of another territory; this directional behaviour provides benefits to the recipient at a cost to the visiting male. We characterize social ties among pairs of territory holders according to the directionality of their interactions, and show here that territory holding males engaged in far more reciprocated (bidirectional) partnerships with other territory holders than expected by chance. Reciprocated partnerships were also stronger (i.e., the partners interacted more frequently) than non-reciprocated partnerships, controlling for spatial proximity of the territories. An individual-level analysis revealed that a males social contribution to a given partner was predictive of the number of social interactions he received from that same partner. Finally, we show that reciprocation predicted the long-term stability of social partnerships one year later. Together, these results demonstrate that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks where partner choice is flexible.

LAY SUMMARYO_ST_ABSWhen animals are free to choose their partners, how does reciprocity influence social dynamics?C_ST_ABSIn the wire-tailed manakin, males form coalitions with other males to help attract mates. We tracked male social networks and found that some males form reciprocal partnerships where each male leaves its territory to display at the others territory. These bidirectional partnerships are particularly strong and stable, indicating that reciprocity is associated with stability in complex social networks.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hummingbirds outperform other birds in terms of aerial agility at low flight speeds. To reveal the key mechanisms that enable such unparalleled agility, we reconstructed body and wing motion of hummingbird escape maneuvers from high-speed videos; then, we performed computational fluid dynamics modeling and flight mechanics analysis, in which each wingbeat was resolved. We found that the birds utilized the inertia of their wings to achieve peak body rotational acceleration within half a wingbeat before the aerodynamic forces became dominant. The aerodynamic forces instead counteracted the reversed inertial forces in the other half wingbeat, thereby to sustain body rotation, albeit at a lower acceleration. Thus, individual wingbeat cycles that generated body rotations can be split into an agility phase with rapid inertial acceleration, and a stability phase with counteracting aerodynamic and inertial acceleration. This mechanism involving inertial steering enables hummingbirds to generate instantaneous body acceleration at any phase of a wingbeat, and it is likely the key to understanding the unique dexterity distinguishing them from aircraft that solely rely on aerodynamics for maneuvering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Piloerection (e.g., goosebumps) is an essential thermoregulatory and social signalling mechanism in non-human animals. While humans also experience piloerection--often being perceived as an indicator of profound emotional experiences--its comparatively less effective role in thermoregulation and communication might influence our capacity to monitor its occurrence. We present three studies (total N = 617) demonstrating participants general inability to detect their own piloerection events and their lack of awareness that piloerection occurs with a similar frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Participants over-reported piloerection events with only 31.8% coinciding with observable piloerection, a bias unrelated to piloerection intensity, anatomical location, heart rate variability, or interoceptive awareness. We also discovered a self-report bias for the forearm, contradicting the observation that piloerection occurs with equal frequency on multiple anatomical locations. Finally, there was low correspondence between self-reports of being &#34;emotionally moved&#34; and observed piloerection. These counterintuitive findings not only highlight a disconnect between an obvious physiological response and our capacity for self-monitoring, but they underscore a fascinating divergence between human and non-human species. While piloerection is vital in non-human organisms, the connection between piloerection and psychological experience in humans may be less significant than previously assumed, possibly due to its diminished evolutionary relevance.

Statement of ImpactThis research reveals a striking dissociation between an obvious physiological response-- piloerection--and human capacity for self-perception. While this highlights the limitations of relying on self-report measures, it also underscores an important divergence between humans and non-human species. We propose that the relation between piloerection and psychological experience in humans is less pronounced than in other species, potentially due to its diminished role in human evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Investigating the causes and consequences of niche partitioning in populations is a significant goal in ecology and evolutionary biology. Studies have examined genetic and environmentally induced variations in resource utility and their ecological implications. However, few have explored developmental noise or instability as a factor contributing to variation in resource utility. Here, we studied genetic variation, and developmental noise in foraging traits of Drosophila lutescens, a wild fruit fly. Using 70 iso-female lines from a single population, we observed two foraging behavior traits - locomotive activity and resource preferences - in an experimental 8-shaped arena with two different fruit juices in each chamber. The mean locomotive speed and relative preference for orange juice over grape juice varied significantly among iso-female lines, indicating genetic variation in foraging behavior. Additionally, the degree of variation within iso-female lines also varied, showing relatively higher heritability. While the locomotive speed and resource preferences of each line did not correlate with each other, the strength of variation within iso-female lines for locomotive speed showed a significant correlation with that for resource preferences. This suggests that the degree of developmental noise in both locomotive activity and resource preferences is governed by a shared genetic basis. Consequently, developmental noise can contribute to increased phenotypic variation in resource utility within a population and may evolve through natural selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increase of wind turbine installations to limit climate change may affect bird populations because of collisions with rotor blades. Birds may respond to wind turbine presence along a gradient of behavioural changes: avoiding the wind farm (macro-scale) or only the wind turbines either by anticipating wind turbine locations (meso-scale) or engaging into last-minute flee attempts after late perception (micro-scale). We investigated the flight response at these three spatial scales of 25 adult griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) equipped with GPS tags over three years when flying in an area including ten wind farms in the Causses, France. At macro-scale, the population foraging range and habitat use revealed that vultures did not avoid wind farms. To investigate avoidance at meso- and micro-scales we focused on the four mostly visited wind farms. We compared vulture flights to null movement models, based on a method allowing us to keep the correlation between flights and topography while creating movement independent of wind turbine locations. At most sites, vultures did not show avoidance behaviour. Yet, simulations from our agent-based model highlighted that the avoidance pattern detected at one wind farm matched with an anticipated avoidance of turbines, probably linked to the presence of a ridge nearby. Overall, our results suggest wind farm-specific responses by soaring birds as a function of the landscape topography. Thus, stakeholders should carefully consider the wind farm location for siting and designing preventive measures (e.g. improve detection of species not able to avoid turbines in switching off on-demand technologies) to reduce collision risk of soaring birds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emotional fluctuations are ubiquitous in everyday life, but precisely how they sculpt the temporal organization of memories remains unclear. Here, we designed a novel task-the Emotion Boundary Task-wherein participants viewed sequences of negative and neutral images surrounded by a color border. We manipulated perceptual context (border color), emotional valence, as well as the direction of emotional-valence shifts (i.e., transitions from neutral-to-negative and negative-to-neutral events). We measured memory for temporal order and subjectively remembered temporal distances for images processed within and across events. Negative images processed within events were remembered as closer in time compared to neutral ones. In contrast, temporal distance was remembered as longer for images spanning neutral-to-negative transitions-suggesting temporal dilation in memory with the onset of a negative event following a previously-neutral state. The extent of this negative-picture induced temporal dilation in memory correlated with dispositional negativity across individuals. Lastly, temporal order memory was enhanced for recently presented negative (compared to neutral) images. These findings suggest that emotional-state dynamics matters when considering emotion-temporal memory interactions: While persistent negative events may compress subjectively remembered time, dynamic shifts from neutral to negative events produce temporal dilation in memory, which may be relevant for adaptive emotional functioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To protect themselves from predators, fishes often form schools with other fish. Previous work has identified abstract &#34;rules&#34; of schooling - attraction to neighbours that are far away, repulsion from neighbours that are too close, and alignment with neighbours at the correct distance - but we do not understand well how these rules emerge from the sensory physiology and behaviour of individual fish. In particular, fish use both vision and their lateral lines to sense other fish, but it is unclear how they integrate information from these sensory modalities to coordinate schooling behaviour. To address this question, we studied how the schooling of giant danios (Devario aequipinnatus) changes when they are either unable to see or unable to use their lateral lines. We found that giant danios were able to school normally without their lateral lines, but did not school in darkness. Surprisingly, giant danios in darkness had the same attraction and alignment properties as fish in light, potentially indicating that they do not feel as much risk in darkness. Overall, we suggest that differences among schooling species in sensory integration between vision and lateral line may depend on their natural predators and environment.</p>
