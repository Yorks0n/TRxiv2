V.; Stemmer, M.; Baier, H.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560453\nAnimal behavior is adapted to the sensory environment in which it evolved, while also being constrained by physical limits, evolutionary history, and developmental trajectories. The hunting behavior of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), a cyprinid native to streams in Eastern India, has been well characterized. However, it is unknown if the complement and sequence of movements employed during prey capture by zebrafish is universal across freshwater teleosts. Here, we explore the syntax of prey capture behavior in larval fish belonging to the clade Percomorpha, whose last common ancestor with cyprinids lived ~240 million years ago. We compared the behavior of four cichlid species from Lake Tanganyika endemic to deep benthic parts of the lake (Lepidiolamprologus attenuatus, Lamprologus ocellatus, and Neolamprologus multifasciatus) or inhabiting rivers (Astatotilapia burtoni) with that of medaka (Oryzias latipes), a fish found in rice paddies in East Asia. Using high speed videography and neural networks, we tracked eye movements and extracted swim kinematics during hunting from these five species. Notably, we found that the repertoire of hunting movements of cichlids is broader than that of zebrafish, but shares basic features, such as eye convergence, positioning of prey centrally in the binocular visual field, and discrete prey capture bouts, including two kinds of capture strikes. In contrast, medaka swim continuously, track the prey monocularly without eye convergence, and position prey laterally before capturing them with a side swing. This configuration of kinematic motifs suggests that medaka may judge distance to prey by motion parallax, while cichlids and zebrafish may use binocular visual cues. Together, our study documents the diversification of locomotor and oculomotor adaptations across hunting teleost larvae.\nA locomotion-based assay to measure prepulse inhibition in zebrafish larvae\nAuthors: Read, E.; Hindges, R.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.29.560094\nSensory gating, assessed using a prepulse inhibition assay (PPI), is a promising endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders that can be measured in larval zebrafish models. However, current PPI assays require high-speed cameras to capture rapid c-bend startle behaviours. In this study, we designed and employed a PPI paradigm that uses locomotion as read-out of startle responses. PPI percentage was measured at a maximum of 86% and this was reduced to 42% upon administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. This work provides the foundation for simpler and more accessible PPI assays using larval zebrafish to model key endophenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.\nPositive Transfer of the Whisper Speech Transformer to Human and Animal Voice Activity Detection\nAuthors: Gu, N.; Lee, K.; Basha, M.; Ram, S. K.; You, G.; Hahnloser, R.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560270\nThis paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.1\nThe archerfish can use motor adaptation to correct for light refraction at the water air interface\nAuthors: Volotsky, S.; Donchin, O.; Segev, R.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560658\nThe archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the waters surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome light refraction at the air-water interface since there is a considerable difference between the actual location of a target and the line of sight. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate from various angles and positions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of an archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error; i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. The results showed that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbing airflow.\nThe socio-spatial ecology of giant anteaters in the Brazilian Cerrado\nAuthors: Chhen, A.; Noonan, M. J.; Desbiez, A. L.; Bertassoni, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560744\nMovement is a key component of an animal's life history. While there are numerous factors that influence movement, there is an inherent link between a species' social ecology and its movement ecology. Despite this inherent relationship, the socio-spatial ecology of many species remains unknown, hampering ecological theory and conservation alike. Here, we use fine-scale GPS location data and continuous-time stochastic processes to study the socio-spatial ecology of 23 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that individuals occupied stable home ranges with a mean area of 5.45 km2 with males having significantly larger home ranges than females. The average amount of home-range overlap was low (0.20, n = 121 dyads), with no evidence that giant anteater home ranges were structured based on territorial, mate guarding, nor other social behaviour. We also identified a total of 2774 encounter events. Interestingly, both female-male and male-male dyads had significantly more encounters than female-female dyads, with two pronounced seasonal peaks in female-male encounters. Though encounters occurred frequently, associations between dyads were generally weak and there was little evidence of any correlated movement (mean amount of total correlation = 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest giant anteaters are a solitary and largely asocial species that readily share space with conspecifics. Despite their present capacity to share space, the combined pressures of being condensed into smaller areas and decreased food availability due to increased pesticide use may see behavioural changes radiating throughout the population. Our study provides insight into heretofore unknown aspects of the socio-spatial ecology of this iconic, but understudied species, as well as crucial information for proactive area-based management. Ultimately, these findings contribute towards sustainable development while potentially maintaining the ecological integrity of giant anteaters and their habitats.\nImproving vocal communication with a ketogenic diet in a mouse model of autism\nAuthors: Möhrle, D.; Murari, K.; Rho, J. M.; Cheng, N.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561083\nBackground: Deficits in social communication and language development is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder currently with no cure. Interventional studies using animal models have been very limited in demonstrating improved vocal communication. Autism has been proposed to involve metabolic dysregulation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a metabolism-based therapy for medically intractable epilepsy, and its applications in other neurological conditions have been increasingly tested. However, how it would affect vocal communication has not been explored. The BTBR mouse strain is considered a model of idiopathic autism. They display robust deficits in vocalization during social interaction, and have metabolic changes implicated in autism. Methods: We investigated the effects of KD on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in juvenile and adult BTBR mice during male-female social encounters. Results: After a brief treatment with KD, the amount, spectral bandwidth, and much of the temporal structure of USVs were robustly improved in both juvenile and adult BTBR mice. Composition of call categories and transitioning between individual call subtypes was more effectively improved in juvenile BTBR mice. Limitations: Although sharing certain attributes, mouse vocalization is unlikely to model all aspects in the development and deficits of human language. KD is highly restrictive and can be difficult to administer, especially for many people with autism who have narrow food selections. Side effects and potential influence on development should also be considered. Future studies are required to tease apart the molecular mechanisms of KD's effects on vocalization. Conclusions: Together, our data provide further support to the hypothesis that metabolism-based dietary intervention could modify disease expression, including core symptoms, in autism.\nThe effects of sport-specific training on individuals action strategies while avoiding a virtual player approaching on a 45{o} angle while completing a secondary task\nAuthors: Thompson, B.; Cinelli, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559848\nSports provide varying scenarios where athletes must interact with and avoid opposing players in dynamic environments. As such, sport-specific training can improve ones ability to integrate visual information which may result in improved collision avoidance behaviours. However, improved visuomotor capabilities are highly task dependent (i.e., athletes must be tested in sport-specific settings). The current study examined whether sport-specific training influenced individuals collision avoidance behaviours during a sport-specific task in virtual reality. Untrained young adults (N=21, 22.9{+/-}1.9 yrs, 11 males) and specifically trained athletes (N=18, 20{+/-}1.5 yrs, 7 males) were immersed in a virtual environment and were instructed to walk along a 7.5m path towards a goal located along the midline. Two virtual players positioned 2.83m to the left and right of the midline approached participants on a 45{degrees} angle at one of three speeds: 0.8x, 1.0x, or 1.2x each participants average walking speed. Participants were instructed to walk to a goal without colliding with the virtual players while performing a secondary task; reporting whether a shape changed above either of the virtual players heads. Results revealed that athletes had a higher percentage of correct responses on the secondary task compared to untrained young adults. However, there was no group differences in the average time to first avoidance or average minimum clearance, but athletes were more variable in their avoidance behaviours. Findings from this study demonstrate that athletes may be more adaptive in their behaviours and may perform better on attentionally demanding tasks in dynamic environments.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Sensory gating, assessed using a prepulse inhibition assay (PPI), is a promising endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders that can be measured in larval zebrafish models. However, current PPI assays require high-speed cameras to capture rapid c-bend startle behaviours. In this study, we designed and employed a PPI paradigm that uses locomotion as read-out of startle responses. PPI percentage was measured at a maximum of 86% and this was reduced to 42% upon administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. This work provides the foundation for simpler and more accessible PPI assays using larval zebrafish to model key endophenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This paper introduces WhisperSeg, utilizing the Whisper Transformer pre-trained for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for human and animal Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Contrary to traditional methods that detect human voice or animal vocalizations from a short audio frame and rely on careful threshold selection, WhisperSeg processes entire spectrograms of long audio and generates plain text representations of onset, offset, and type of voice activity. Processing a longer audio context with a larger network greatly improves detection accuracy from few labeled examples. We further demonstrate a positive transfer of detection performance to new animal species, making our approach viable in the data-scarce multi-species setting.1</p>

        <p class="abstract">The archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the waters surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome light refraction at the air-water interface since there is a considerable difference between the actual location of a target and the line of sight. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate from various angles and positions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of an archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error; i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. The results showed that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbing airflow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Movement is a key component of an animal&#39;s life history. While there are numerous factors that influence movement, there is an inherent link between a species&#39; social ecology and its movement ecology. Despite this inherent relationship, the socio-spatial ecology of many species remains unknown, hampering ecological theory and conservation alike. Here, we use fine-scale GPS location data and continuous-time stochastic processes to study the socio-spatial ecology of 23 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that individuals occupied stable home ranges with a mean area of 5.45 km2 with males having significantly larger home ranges than females. The average amount of home-range overlap was low (0.20, n = 121 dyads), with no evidence that giant anteater home ranges were structured based on territorial, mate guarding, nor other social behaviour. We also identified a total of 2774 encounter events. Interestingly, both female-male and male-male dyads had significantly more encounters than female-female dyads, with two pronounced seasonal peaks in female-male encounters. Though encounters occurred frequently, associations between dyads were generally weak and there was little evidence of any correlated movement (mean amount of total correlation = 0.01). Collectively, these findings suggest giant anteaters are a solitary and largely asocial species that readily share space with conspecifics. Despite their present capacity to share space, the combined pressures of being condensed into smaller areas and decreased food availability due to increased pesticide use may see behavioural changes radiating throughout the population. Our study provides insight into heretofore unknown aspects of the socio-spatial ecology of this iconic, but understudied species, as well as crucial information for proactive area-based management. Ultimately, these findings contribute towards sustainable development while potentially maintaining the ecological integrity of giant anteaters and their habitats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Deficits in social communication and language development is a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder currently with no cure. Interventional studies using animal models have been very limited in demonstrating improved vocal communication. Autism has been proposed to involve metabolic dysregulation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a metabolism-based therapy for medically intractable epilepsy, and its applications in other neurological conditions have been increasingly tested. However, how it would affect vocal communication has not been explored. The BTBR mouse strain is considered a model of idiopathic autism. They display robust deficits in vocalization during social interaction, and have metabolic changes implicated in autism. Methods: We investigated the effects of KD on ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in juvenile and adult BTBR mice during male-female social encounters. Results: After a brief treatment with KD, the amount, spectral bandwidth, and much of the temporal structure of USVs were robustly improved in both juvenile and adult BTBR mice. Composition of call categories and transitioning between individual call subtypes was more effectively improved in juvenile BTBR mice. Limitations: Although sharing certain attributes, mouse vocalization is unlikely to model all aspects in the development and deficits of human language. KD is highly restrictive and can be difficult to administer, especially for many people with autism who have narrow food selections. Side effects and potential influence on development should also be considered. Future studies are required to tease apart the molecular mechanisms of KD&#39;s effects on vocalization. Conclusions: Together, our data provide further support to the hypothesis that metabolism-based dietary intervention could modify disease expression, including core symptoms, in autism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sports provide varying scenarios where athletes must interact with and avoid opposing players in dynamic environments. As such, sport-specific training can improve ones ability to integrate visual information which may result in improved collision avoidance behaviours. However, improved visuomotor capabilities are highly task dependent (i.e., athletes must be tested in sport-specific settings). The current study examined whether sport-specific training influenced individuals collision avoidance behaviours during a sport-specific task in virtual reality. Untrained young adults (N=21, 22.9{&#43;/-}1.9 yrs, 11 males) and specifically trained athletes (N=18, 20{&#43;/-}1.5 yrs, 7 males) were immersed in a virtual environment and were instructed to walk along a 7.5m path towards a goal located along the midline. Two virtual players positioned 2.83m to the left and right of the midline approached participants on a 45{degrees} angle at one of three speeds: 0.8x, 1.0x, or 1.2x each participants average walking speed. Participants were instructed to walk to a goal without colliding with the virtual players while performing a secondary task; reporting whether a shape changed above either of the virtual players heads. Results revealed that athletes had a higher percentage of correct responses on the secondary task compared to untrained young adults. However, there was no group differences in the average time to first avoidance or average minimum clearance, but athletes were more variable in their avoidance behaviours. Findings from this study demonstrate that athletes may be more adaptive in their behaviours and may perform better on attentionally demanding tasks in dynamic environments.</p>
