The effects of gut microbiome on aggression\nAuthors: Uzan-Yulzari, A.; Turjeman, S.; Getselter, D.; Rautava, S.; Isolauri, E.; Khatib, S.; Elliott, E.; Koren, O.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564110\nRecent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science. One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.\nDistinct developmental trajectories of autonomous behaviors and agency in rodents\nAuthors: Mitelut, C.; Diez Castro, M.; Peterson, R. E.; Goncalves, M.; Gamer, M. M.; Nilsson, S. R. O.; Pereira, T. D.; Sanes, D. H.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566632\nBehavioral interactions within the nuclear family may play a pivotal role in the emergence of autonomy and agency in mammals. While the emergence of a behavior may arise over weeks in line with nervous system maturation, individual events occur on sub-second time scales. This makes it uniquely challenging to track development in the lab where observations are made over minutes to hours or in ecological studies which lack individual specificity and sub-second precision. Here we study families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, raised in enlarged home-cage environments over weeks of development, using continuous video recordings to capture tens of millions of time points per family. Focusing on postnatal day 15 (when pups leave the nest) to day 30 (around the time when pups would disperse) we identify distinct developmental trajectories for both autonomous behaviors (exploration, food and water foraging), and social behaviors (huddling, approach, time spent together). Most of these behaviors emerge in concert with clear diurnal and crepuscular patterns and we find sex differences in both autonomous and social behaviors. Our work supports the emergence of distinct autonomous and social behavior phenotypes as the behavioral correlates of critical developmental periods of maturation of the rodent brain and can form the basis of future research on development from both neuroscience and behavioral biology perspectives.\nA state with increased arousal threshold in Araneus diadematus (Araneidae) measured in the wild: new evidence for sleep in spiders\nAuthors: Rössler, D. C.; Herberstein, M. E.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563109\nSleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.\nMoveR: an R package for easy processing and analysis of animal video-tracking data\nAuthors: PETITJEAN, Q.; LARTIGUE, S.; COINTE, M.; RIS, N.; calcagno, v.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566216\nAnimal movement and behavior are critical to understanding ecological and evolutionary processes. Recent years have witnessed an increase in methodological and technological innovations in video-tracking solutions for phenotyping animal behavior. Although these advances enable the collection of high-resolution data describing the movement of multiple individuals, analyzing and interpreting them remains challenging due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and noisiness. Here, we introduce MoveR, an R package for importing, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing data from common video-tracking solutions. MoveR includes flexible tools for polishing data, removing tracking artifacts, subsetting and plotting individual paths, and computing different movement and behavior metrics.\nA Multi-task Platform for Profiling Cognitive and Motivational Constructs in Humans and Nonhuman Primates\nAuthors: Watson, M. R.; Traczewski, N.; Dhungana, S.; Boroujeni, K. B.; Neumann, A.; Wen, X.; Womelsdorf, T.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566422\nBackground: Understanding the neurobiological substrates of psychiatric disorders requires comprehensive evaluations of cognitive and motivational functions in preclinical research settings. The translational validity of such evaluations will be supported by (1) tasks with high construct validity that are engaging and easy to teach to human and nonhuman participants, (2) software that enables efficient switching between multiple tasks in single sessions, (3) software that supports tasks across a broad range of physical experimental setups, and (4) by platform architectures that are easily extendable and customizable to encourage optimization and future development. New Method: We describe the Multi-task Universal Suite for Experiments (M-USE), a software platform designed to meet these requirements. It leverages the Unity video game engine and C# programming language to (1) support immersive and engaging tasks for humans and nonhuman primates, (2) allow experimenters or participants to switch between multiple tasks within-session, (3) generate builds that function across computers, tablets, and websites, and (4) is freely available online with documentation and tutorials for users and developers. M-USE includes a task library with seven pre-existing tasks assessing cognitive and motivational constructs of perception, attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, motivational and affective self-control, relational long-term memory, and visuo-spatial problem solving. Results: M-USE was used to test NHPs on up to six tasks per session, all available as part of the Task Library, and to extract performance metrics for all major cognitive and motivational constructs spanning the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institutes of Mental Health. Comparison with Existing Methods: Other experiment design and control systems exist, but do not provide the full range of features available in M-USE, including a pre-existing task library for cross-species assessments; the ability to switch seamlessly between tasks in individual sessions; cross-platform build capabilities; license-free availability; and its leveraging of video-engine capabilities used to gamify tasks. Conclusions: The new multi-task platform facilitates cross-species translational research for understanding the neurobiological substrates of higher cognitive and motivational functions.\nFemale cichlids attack and avoid-but will still mate with-androgen receptor mutant males that lack male-typical body coloration\nAuthors: Howard, M.; Ramsaroop, M.; Hoadley, A.; Jackson, L.; Lopez, M.; Saenz, L.; Alward, B. A.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565323\nA key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b+ cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b+ cells to coordinate behavioral output.\nMultidimensional behavioral profiles associated with resilience and susceptibility after inescapable stress\nAuthors: de Oliveira-Junior, B. A.; Marques, D. B.; Rossignoli, M. T.; Prizon, T.; Leite, J. P.; Ruggiero, R. N.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566266\nStress-related neuropsychiatric disorders are complex conditions that are difficult to diagnose and treat due to the variety of symptoms they present with. While animal models have been instrumental in understanding their underlying mechanisms, there is an ongoing debate about the validity of behavioral measures to address specific disorders. Here, we conducted an extensive ethological characterization of behavioral variables associated with anxiety and depression and employed a multidimensional approach to investigate stress susceptibility in male Wistar rats. The rats underwent inescapable footshocks (IS) or no-shocks (NS), followed by a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests over several days. Our study identified phenotypically distinct clusters, including fully characterized stress-susceptible and stress-resilient subpopulations, along with intermediate phenotypes. Reduced time in elevated plus maze open arms, diminished sucrose preference and increased escape failures consistently differentiated susceptible from resilient rats. Behavior in the forced swim test was unrelated to stress susceptibility. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationships between classical behavioral measures in animal models of depression, highlighting distinct patterns that differentiate susceptibility from resilience. It emphasizes the importance of a multidimensional assessment of behavioral responses in animal models for a better understanding of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.\nA Pair of Cadmium-exposed Zebrafish Affect Boldness and Landmark use in the Un-exposed Majority\nAuthors: Shelton, D.; Suriyampola, P. S.; Dinges, Z. M.; Glaholt, S. P.; Shaw, J. R.; Martins, E. P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566440\nSome individuals have a disproportionate effect on group responses. These individuals may possess distinct attributes that differentiate them from others. These characteristics may include susceptibility to contaminant exposure such as cadmium, a potent trace metal present in water and food. Here, we tested whether a pair of cadmium-exposed individuals could exert an impact on the behavior of the unexposed majority. We used behavioral assessments to characterize the extent of the effects of the cadmium-exposed pair on group boldness, cohesion, activity and responses to landmarks. We found that groups with a pair of cadmium-exposed fish approached and remained closer to novel stimuli and landmarks than did groups with pairs of fish treated with uncontaminated water (control). Shoals with cadmium and water treated fish exhibited similar levels of cohesion and activity. The results suggest that fish acutely exposed to environmentally-relevant cadmium concentrations can have profound effects on the un-exposed majority.\nNucleus accumbens dopamine release reflects Bayesian inference during instrumental learning\nAuthors: Qu, A. J.; Tai, L.-H.; Hall, C. D.; Tu, E. M.; Eckstein, M. K.; Mischanchuk, K.; Lin, W. C.; Chase, J. B.; MacAskill, A. F.; Collins, A. G. E.; Gershman, S. J.; Wilbrecht, L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566306\nDopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal reward prediction error, the difference between observed and predicted reward, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches repeatedly. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals reflecting dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched the dopamine measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation plays a fundamental role in instrumental performance and associated mesolimbic dopamine signaling.\nKnowledge by omission: the significance of omissions in the 5-choice serial reaction time task\nAuthors: Vouillac, C.; Durand, A.; Ahmed, S. H.; Guillem, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565747\nThe 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Recent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.

One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Behavioral interactions within the nuclear family may play a pivotal role in the emergence of autonomy and agency in mammals. While the emergence of a behavior may arise over weeks in line with nervous system maturation, individual events occur on sub-second time scales. This makes it uniquely challenging to track development in the lab where observations are made over minutes to hours or in ecological studies which lack individual specificity and sub-second precision. Here we study families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, raised in enlarged home-cage environments over weeks of development, using continuous video recordings to capture tens of millions of time points per family. Focusing on postnatal day 15 (when pups leave the nest) to day 30 (around the time when pups would disperse) we identify distinct developmental trajectories for both autonomous behaviors (exploration, food and water foraging), and social behaviors (huddling, approach, time spent together). Most of these behaviors emerge in concert with clear diurnal and crepuscular patterns and we find sex differences in both autonomous and social behaviors. Our work supports the emergence of distinct autonomous and social behavior phenotypes as the behavioral correlates of critical developmental periods of maturation of the rodent brain and can form the basis of future research on development from both neuroscience and behavioral biology perspectives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal movement and behavior are critical to understanding ecological and evolutionary processes. Recent years have witnessed an increase in methodological and technological innovations in video-tracking solutions for phenotyping animal behavior. Although these advances enable the collection of high-resolution data describing the movement of multiple individuals, analyzing and interpreting them remains challenging due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and noisiness. Here, we introduce MoveR, an R package for importing, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing data from common video-tracking solutions. MoveR includes flexible tools for polishing data, removing tracking artifacts, subsetting and plotting individual paths, and computing different movement and behavior metrics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Understanding the neurobiological substrates of psychiatric disorders requires comprehensive evaluations of cognitive and motivational functions in preclinical research settings. The translational validity of such evaluations will be supported by (1) tasks with high construct validity that are engaging and easy to teach to human and nonhuman participants, (2) software that enables efficient switching between multiple tasks in single sessions, (3) software that supports tasks across a broad range of physical experimental setups, and (4) by platform architectures that are easily extendable and customizable to encourage optimization and future development. New Method: We describe the Multi-task Universal Suite for Experiments (M-USE), a software platform designed to meet these requirements. It leverages the Unity video game engine and C# programming language to (1) support immersive and engaging tasks for humans and nonhuman primates, (2) allow experimenters or participants to switch between multiple tasks within-session, (3) generate builds that function across computers, tablets, and websites, and (4) is freely available online with documentation and tutorials for users and developers. M-USE includes a task library with seven pre-existing tasks assessing cognitive and motivational constructs of perception, attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, motivational and affective self-control, relational long-term memory, and visuo-spatial problem solving. Results: M-USE was used to test NHPs on up to six tasks per session, all available as part of the Task Library, and to extract performance metrics for all major cognitive and motivational constructs spanning the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institutes of Mental Health. Comparison with Existing Methods: Other experiment design and control systems exist, but do not provide the full range of features available in M-USE, including a pre-existing task library for cross-species assessments; the ability to switch seamlessly between tasks in individual sessions; cross-platform build capabilities; license-free availability; and its leveraging of video-engine capabilities used to gamify tasks. Conclusions: The new multi-task platform facilitates cross-species translational research for understanding the neurobiological substrates of higher cognitive and motivational functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b&#43; cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b&#43; cells to coordinate behavioral output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders are complex conditions that are difficult to diagnose and treat due to the variety of symptoms they present with. While animal models have been instrumental in understanding their underlying mechanisms, there is an ongoing debate about the validity of behavioral measures to address specific disorders. Here, we conducted an extensive ethological characterization of behavioral variables associated with anxiety and depression and employed a multidimensional approach to investigate stress susceptibility in male Wistar rats. The rats underwent inescapable footshocks (IS) or no-shocks (NS), followed by a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests over several days. Our study identified phenotypically distinct clusters, including fully characterized stress-susceptible and stress-resilient subpopulations, along with intermediate phenotypes. Reduced time in elevated plus maze open arms, diminished sucrose preference and increased escape failures consistently differentiated susceptible from resilient rats. Behavior in the forced swim test was unrelated to stress susceptibility. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationships between classical behavioral measures in animal models of depression, highlighting distinct patterns that differentiate susceptibility from resilience. It emphasizes the importance of a multidimensional assessment of behavioral responses in animal models for a better understanding of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Some individuals have a disproportionate effect on group responses. These individuals may possess distinct attributes that differentiate them from others. These characteristics may include susceptibility to contaminant exposure such as cadmium, a potent trace metal present in water and food. Here, we tested whether a pair of cadmium-exposed individuals could exert an impact on the behavior of the unexposed majority. We used behavioral assessments to characterize the extent of the effects of the cadmium-exposed pair on group boldness, cohesion, activity and responses to landmarks. We found that groups with a pair of cadmium-exposed fish approached and remained closer to novel stimuli and landmarks than did groups with pairs of fish treated with uncontaminated water (control). Shoals with cadmium and water treated fish exhibited similar levels of cohesion and activity. The results suggest that fish acutely exposed to environmentally-relevant cadmium concentrations can have profound effects on the un-exposed majority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal reward prediction error, the difference between observed and predicted reward, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches repeatedly. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals reflecting dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched the dopamine measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation plays a fundamental role in instrumental performance and associated mesolimbic dopamine signaling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.</p>
