In species where females mate with multiple males in succession, females may bias offspring paternity by favoring the sperm of one male over another, a process known as cryptic female choice (CFC). While evidence of CFC exists in multiple taxa, the mechanisms underlying this process have remained difficult to unravel. Understanding CFC requires demonstration of a female-driven post mating bias in sperm use and paternity, and a causal link between this bias and male cues. Here, we show that in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, mated females eject the ejaculate of the first male they mated with faster when exposed to the pheromones of an attractive male than in the presence of an unattractive one. Using transgenic males expressing fluorescent sperm, we show that exposure to attractive males between mating causes twice-mated females to bias sperm storage towards the second male, affecting paternity. Using pheromonal bioassays in combination with genetic manipulation of sensory systems, we show that females modulate ejaculate ejection latency in response to male pheromones heptanal and 11-cis-Vaccenyl acetate (cVA) sensed via olfactory receptor neurons OR35a, Or22a, Or65a and OR67d, demonstrating that polyandrous females use male pheromonal cues to modulate ejaculate ejection timing and impact paternity. We provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of a CFC mechanism allowing a female to increase or decrease the share of paternity of her first mate depending on the sensing of the quality of potential mates in her environment. These findings showcase that paternity can be influenced by events that go beyond copulation and highlights the importance of post-copulatory sexual selection.\nThe demographic drivers of cultural evolution in bird song: a multilevel study\nAuthors: Recalde, N. M.; Estandia, A.; Keen, S. C.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452\nSocial learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from \u003e400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.\nMCFBM: a behavioral analysis system enabling objective inference of songbirds' attention during social interactions\nAuthors: Fujibayashi, M.; Abe, K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573152\nUnderstanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention\nWhole group tracking reveals that relatedness drives consistent subgrouping patterns in white-nosed coatis\nAuthors: Grout, E. M.; Ortega, J.; Minasandra, P.; Quin, M. J.; Crofoot, M. C.; Strandburg-Peshkin, A.; Hirsch, B. T.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571650\nThe formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.\nHigh Resolution Outdoor Videography of Insects Using Fast Lock-On Tracking\nAuthors: Vo-Doan, T. T.; Titov, V. V.; Harrap, M. J.; Lochner, S.; Straw, A. D.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572558\nInsects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings. One-Sentence SummaryFast Lock-On tracking enables recording trajectories and high-speed videos of insects behaving over large areas in the wild.\nSubstantial decline of phasic dopamine signaling in senescent male rats does not impact dopamine-dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\nAuthors: Sandberg, S. G.; Stanford, C. A.; Phillips, P. E. M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.572806\nNormal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.\nContrasting roles of Beclin-1 in pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviours in a mouse model of neuropathic pain\nAuthors: Zaheer, F.; Levine, G. J.; Simal, A. L.; Reid, P. O.; Fatemi, R.; Martino, T. A.; Descalzi, G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572240\nChronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting 1 in 5 adults globally1. The current understanding of chronic pain remains inadequate, coupled with few available therapeutics for the treatment of associated mental health disorders. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions and investigation at the cellular levels may reveal a better understanding of the processes that occur leading to the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found that adult male mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function show enhanced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared to wildtype controls. Remarkably, we found that while SNI induced increases in anxiety-like behaviours in wildtype mice, this was not observed in mice with impaired BECLIN-1 protein function. Our data thus indicates that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotion related effects of chronic neuropathic pain.\nHemolymph transfusions transfer heritable learned novel odor preferences to naive larvae of Bicyclus anynana butterflies\nAuthors: Gowri, V.; Monteiro, A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572719\nThe mechanisms whereby environmental experiences of parents are transmitted to their offspring to impact their behavior and fitness are poorly understood. Previously, we showed that naive Bicyclus anynana butterfly larvae, whose parents fed on a normal plant feed but coated with a novel odor, inherited a learned preference towards that odor, which had initially elicited avoidance in the naive parents. Here, we performed simple hemolymph transfusions from odor-fed and control-fed larvae to naive larval recipients. We found that larvae injected with hemolymph from odor-fed donors stopped avoiding the novel odor, and their naive offspring preferred the odor more, compared to the offspring of larvae injected with control hemolymph. These results indicate that factors in the hemolymph, potentially the odor molecule itself, play an important role in odor learning and preference transmission across generations. Furthermore, this mechanism of odor preference inheritance, mediated by the hemolymph, bypasses the peripheral odor-sensing mechanisms taking place in the antennae, mouthparts, or legs, and may mediate host plant switching and diversification in the Lepidoptera or more broadly across insects.\nWind Gates Search States in Free Flight\nAuthors: Stupski, S. D.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569086\nFor any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, wind and water currents may not always provide a reliable directional cue [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise \"virtual\" olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped \"sink and circle\" search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and \"anemometric\" turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.\nThe significance of social interactions in synchronized swarming flight in a termite\nAuthors: Mizumoto, N.; Nozaki, T.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573318\nIn social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this swarming behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Females control the paternity of their offspring by selectively mating with males they perceive to be of high quality. In species where females mate with multiple males in succession, females may bias offspring paternity by favoring the sperm of one male over another, a process known as cryptic female choice (CFC). While evidence of CFC exists in multiple taxa, the mechanisms underlying this process have remained difficult to unravel. Understanding CFC requires demonstration of a female-driven post mating bias in sperm use and paternity, and a causal link between this bias and male cues. Here, we show that in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, mated females eject the ejaculate of the first male they mated with faster when exposed to the pheromones of an attractive male than in the presence of an unattractive one. Using transgenic males expressing fluorescent sperm, we show that exposure to attractive males between mating causes twice-mated females to bias sperm storage towards the second male, affecting paternity. Using pheromonal bioassays in combination with genetic manipulation of sensory systems, we show that females modulate ejaculate ejection latency in response to male pheromones heptanal and 11-cis-Vaccenyl acetate (cVA) sensed via olfactory receptor neurons OR35a, Or22a, Or65a and OR67d, demonstrating that polyandrous females use male pheromonal cues to modulate ejaculate ejection timing and impact paternity. We provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of a CFC mechanism allowing a female to increase or decrease the share of paternity of her first mate depending on the sensing of the quality of potential mates in her environment. These findings showcase that paternity can be influenced by events that go beyond copulation and highlights the importance of post-copulatory sexual selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from &gt;400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding animal behavior is crucial in behavioral neuroscience, which aims to unravel the mechanism driving these behaviors. A milestone in this field is the analysis of behavioral reactions among animals engaging in social interactions. Although many studies have revealed the fundamental roles of social interaction in social learning, the behavioral aspects of these interactions remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of tools for analyzing complex behaviors and the attention of subjects in naturalistic, free-moving conditions. Here, we introduce a high-precision system for behavior analysis in songbirds using a marker-based motion capture technique. This system accurately tracks the body location and head direction of freely moving finches and is applicable to multiple subjects during social interaction. With this system, we have quantitatively analyzed behaviors of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) related to visual attention. Our analysis revealed variations in the use of right and left eyes, as well as the duration of sight, among the individuals presented. Further analysis and comparison of their behaviors during both virtual and live presentation identified the similarities and differences in their behavioral reactions. Additionally, we observed changes in their behavioral reactions during a conditioned learning paradigm. This system provides an efficient and easy-to-use tool for advanced behavioral analysis in songbirds, providing an objective method to infer their focus of attention</p>

        <p class="abstract">The formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological, and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying timespans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings.

        <p class="abstract">Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline which impacts financial decision making. One of the underlying features of decision making is probability estimation, in which nucleus accumbens dopamine signaling has been implicated. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to probe for age differences in dopamine signaling, and pharmacological manipulation to test for age differences in the dopamine dependence of Pavlovian conditioning. We found differences in phasic dopamine signaling to reward delivery, and unconditioned and conditioned stimuli, but no difference in conditioned approach between adult and senescent groups. In addition, we found that dopamine receptor antagonism with flupenthixol (225 g/kg, i.p.) partially inhibited conditioned approach in the adult group, whereas it completely blocked conditioned approach in the senescent group. Further increase in concentration to 300 g/kg, i.p. resulted in complete inhibition of conditioned approach behavior in both age groups. Therefore, while phasic dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens of senescent animals is greatly diminished in concentration, these animals maintain dopamine dependent Pavlovian conditioning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting 1 in 5 adults globally1. The current understanding of chronic pain remains inadequate, coupled with few available therapeutics for the treatment of associated mental health disorders. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions and investigation at the cellular levels may reveal a better understanding of the processes that occur leading to the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found that adult male mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function show enhanced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared to wildtype controls. Remarkably, we found that while SNI induced increases in anxiety-like behaviours in wildtype mice, this was not observed in mice with impaired BECLIN-1 protein function. Our data thus indicates that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotion related effects of chronic neuropathic pain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mechanisms whereby environmental experiences of parents are transmitted to their offspring to impact their behavior and fitness are poorly understood. Previously, we showed that naive Bicyclus anynana butterfly larvae, whose parents fed on a normal plant feed but coated with a novel odor, inherited a learned preference towards that odor, which had initially elicited avoidance in the naive parents. Here, we performed simple hemolymph transfusions from odor-fed and control-fed larvae to naive larval recipients. We found that larvae injected with hemolymph from odor-fed donors stopped avoiding the novel odor, and their naive offspring preferred the odor more, compared to the offspring of larvae injected with control hemolymph. These results indicate that factors in the hemolymph, potentially the odor molecule itself, play an important role in odor learning and preference transmission across generations. Furthermore, this mechanism of odor preference inheritance, mediated by the hemolymph, bypasses the peripheral odor-sensing mechanisms taking place in the antennae, mouthparts, or legs, and may mediate host plant switching and diversification in the Lepidoptera or more broadly across insects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, wind and water currents may not always provide a reliable directional cue [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise &#34;virtual&#34; olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped &#34;sink and circle&#34; search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and &#34;anemometric&#34; turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In social insect colonies, individuals of working caste coordinate their actions to manage various collective tasks. Such collective behaviors are observed not only in working castes but also in reproductives. During certain seasons, newly emerged winged reproductives (alates) fly from the nest to disperse and find mating partners in a synchronized manner. Although this swarming behavior is one of the collective behaviors that involve the greatest number of individuals in social insects, underlying social interactions remain unexplored. Here, we show that synchronized flight among colony members results from collective decision-making. Our simple simulation model suggests that social interactions in a large group of alates enable synchronized flight within a nest under fluctuating environmental conditions. This model is supported by empirical experiments using a termite Reticulitermes kanmonensis. Under the semi-field environment with fluctuating temperatures, alates within the same colony synchronized their dispersal flight under higher air temperatures, while dispersal flight was suppressed under lower temperatures. Furthermore, termites could synchronize their dispersal flights even under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, indicating that environmental cues are not always necessary for synchronization. In either case, higher synchronization happened with a larger number of alates. All these results demonstrate that both environmental and social factors interplay to enable the synchronized swarming flight of social insects.</p>
