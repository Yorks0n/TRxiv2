Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.\nMoveR: an R package for easy processing and analysis of animal video-tracking data\nAuthors: PETITJEAN, Q.; LARTIGUE, S.; COINTE, M.; RIS, N.; calcagno, v.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566216\nAnimal movement and behavior are critical to understanding ecological and evolutionary processes. Recent years have witnessed an increase in methodological and technological innovations in video-tracking solutions for phenotyping animal behavior. Although these advances enable the collection of high-resolution data describing the movement of multiple individuals, analyzing and interpreting them remains challenging due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and noisiness. Here, we introduce MoveR, an R package for importing, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing data from common video-tracking solutions. MoveR includes flexible tools for polishing data, removing tracking artifacts, subsetting and plotting individual paths, and computing different movement and behavior metrics.

E.; Goncalves, M.; Gamer, M. M.; Nilsson, S. R. O.; Pereira, T. D.; Sanes, D. H.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566632\nBehavioral interactions within the nuclear family may play a pivotal role in the emergence of autonomy and agency in mammals. While the emergence of a behavior may arise over weeks in line with nervous system maturation, individual events occur on sub-second time scales. This makes it uniquely challenging to track development in the lab where observations are made over minutes to hours or in ecological studies which lack individual specificity and sub-second precision. Here we study families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, raised in enlarged home-cage environments over weeks of development, using continuous video recordings to capture tens of millions of time points per family. Focusing on postnatal day 15 (when pups leave the nest) to day 30 (around the time when pups would disperse) we identify distinct developmental trajectories for both autonomous behaviors (exploration, food and water foraging), and social behaviors (huddling, approach, time spent together). Most of these behaviors emerge in concert with clear diurnal and crepuscular patterns and we find sex differences in both autonomous and social behaviors. Our work supports the emergence of distinct autonomous and social behavior phenotypes as the behavioral correlates of critical developmental periods of maturation of the rodent brain and can form the basis of future research on development from both neuroscience and behavioral biology perspectives.\nA Multi-task Platform for Profiling Cognitive and Motivational Constructs in Humans and Nonhuman Primates\nAuthors: Watson, M. R.; Traczewski, N.; Dhungana, S.; Boroujeni, K. B.; Neumann, A.; Wen, X.; Womelsdorf, T.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566422\nBackgroundUnderstanding the neurobiological substrates of psychiatric disorders requires comprehensive evaluations of cognitive and motivational functions in preclinical research settings. The translational validity of such evaluations will be supported by (1) tasks with high construct validity that are engaging and easy to teach to human and nonhuman participants, (2) software that enables efficient switching between multiple tasks in single sessions, (3) software that supports tasks across a broad range of physical experimental setups, and (4) by platform architectures that are easily extendable and customizable to encourage future optimization and development. New MethodWe describe the Multi-task Universal Suite for Experiments (M-USE), a software platform designed to meet these requirements. It leverages the Unity video game engine and C# programming language to (1) support immersive and engaging tasks for humans and nonhuman primates, (2) allow experimenters or participants to switch between multiple tasks within-session, (3) generate builds that function across computers, tablets, and websites, and (4) is freely available online with documentation and tutorials for users and developers. M-USE includes a task library with seven pre-existing tasks assessing cognitive and motivational constructs of perception, attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, motivational and affective self-control, relational long-term memory, and visuo-spatial problem solving. ResultsM-USE was used to test NHPs on up to six tasks per session, all available as part of the Task Library, and to extract performance metrics for all major cognitive and motivational constructs spanning the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institutes of Mental Health. Comparison with Existing MethodsOther experiment design and control systems exist, but do not provide the full range of features available in M-USE, including a pre-existing task library for cross-species assessments; the ability to switch seamlessly between tasks in individual sessions; cross-platform build capabilities; license-free availability; and its leveraging of video-engine capabilities used to gamify tasks. ConclusionsThe new multi-task platform facilitates cross-species translational research for understanding the neurobiological substrates of higher cognitive and motivational functions.\nAnimal psychology research changes public attitudes, but not tolerance, towards a wild carnivore beyond non-psychological information\nAuthors: Morton, B.; Henri, D. C.; Adaway, K. A.; Hopkins, C.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566575\nBiodiversity loss is inextricably linked to declining human-nature \"connectedness\", particularly in terms of how people form attitudes and beliefs about the natural world. Anthropomorphism, or attributing human-like qualities to non-human beings, is an increasingly common conservation strategy to encourage human connectedness to wildlife, but such strategies may also contribute to species persecution (e.g., \"bold\" and \"cunning\" predators). The public often ascribes psychological abilities to wildlife, but there have been limited efforts to link public wildlife attitudes to actual animal psychology research. Through a national level survey (n = 1, 373), we used a controlled experimental approach to test whether providing information on the boldness and problem-solving abilities of a wild carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), changed peoples tolerance of them. Half of participants were given information on fox psychology (video or a press release about fox boldness and problem-solving), the other half were given content unrelated to animal psychology (video or a press release about fox habitat use). While attitudes and beliefs related to overall tolerance were unaffected, our findings suggest that providing the public with information about animal psychology research, particularly through videos, may have a role in shaping human-wildlife connectedness by changing, either positively or negatively, other facets to peoples attitudes (e.g., interest factor), and that such effects may be more impactful than information about an animals basic ecology. If harnessed correctly, animal psychology research could offer a useful and unique platform for generating greater public awareness and engagement with the biodiversity crisis. HighlightsO_LIAnthropomorphism impacts attitudes and beliefs about wildlife C_LIO_LIThe influence of animal psychology research is unclear C_LIO_LIWe show fox psychology research changes peoples attitudes C_LIO_LIEffects were greater than information about fox ecology C_LIO_LIPerceived attitude changes did not impact overall fox tolerance C_LI\nMultidimensional behavioral profiles associated with resilience and susceptibility after inescapable stress\nAuthors: de Oliveira-Junior, B. A.; Marques, D. B.; Rossignoli, M. T.; Prizon, T.; Leite, J. P.; Ruggiero, R. N.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566266\nStress-related neuropsychiatric disorders are complex conditions that are difficult to diagnose and treat due to the variety of symptoms they present with. While animal models have been instrumental in understanding their underlying mechanisms, there is an ongoing debate about the validity of behavioral measures to address specific disorders. Here, we conducted an extensive ethological characterization of behavioral variables associated with anxiety and depression and employed a multidimensional approach to investigate stress susceptibility in male Wistar rats. The rats underwent inescapable footshocks (IS) or no-shocks (NS), followed by a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests over several days. Our study identified phenotypically distinct clusters, including fully characterized stress-susceptible and stress-resilient subpopulations, along with intermediate phenotypes. Reduced time in elevated plus maze open arms, diminished sucrose preference and increased escape failures consistently differentiated susceptible from resilient rats. Behavior in the forced swim test was unrelated to stress susceptibility. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationships between classical behavioral measures in animal models of depression, highlighting distinct patterns that differentiate susceptibility from resilience. It emphasizes the importance of a multidimensional assessment of behavioral responses in animal models for a better understanding of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. HIGHLIGHTSO_LIClustering of features reveals a correlation pattern that separates behavioral variables associated with susceptibility from those associated with resilience to stress C_LIO_LIMultidimensional patterns of covariation among behavioral measures distinguish helpless from non-helpless individuals and indicate independence from forced swim test behavior. C_LIO_LIClustering of individuals discriminates stressed subjects and reveals multidimensional behavioral phenotypes of resilience and susceptibility, indicating different stress-coping strategies. C_LI\nA Pair of Cadmium-exposed Zebrafish Affect Boldness and Landmark use in the Un-exposed Majority\nAuthors: Shelton, D.; Suriyampola, P. S.; Dinges, Z. M.; Glaholt, S. P.; Shaw, J. R.; Martins, E. P.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566440\nSome individuals have a disproportionate effect on group responses. These individuals may possess distinct attributes that differentiate them from others. These characteristics may include susceptibility to contaminant exposure such as cadmium, a potent trace metal present in water and food. Here, we tested whether a pair of cadmium-exposed individuals could exert an impact on the behavior of the unexposed majority. We used behavioral assessments to characterize the extent of the effects of the cadmium-exposed pair on group boldness, cohesion, activity and responses to landmarks. We found that groups with a pair of cadmium-exposed fish approached and remained closer to novel stimuli and landmarks than did groups with pairs of fish treated with uncontaminated water (control). Shoals with cadmium and water treated fish exhibited similar levels of cohesion and activity. The results suggest that fish acutely exposed to environmentally-relevant cadmium concentrations can have profound effects on the un-exposed majority.\nDefects in AMPAR trafficking and microglia activation underlie socio-cognitive deficits associated to decreased expression of Phosphodiesterase 2A\nAuthors: Delhaye, S.; Jarjat, M.; Boulksibat, A.; Sanchez, C.; Tempio, A.; Turtoi, A.; Giorgi, M.; Lacas-Gervais, S.; Baj, G.; Rovere, C.; Trezza, V.; Pellegrini, M.; Maurin, T.; Lalli, E.; Bardoni, B.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565257\nPhosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a+/- mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a+/- females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of GluR1 in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent LTD. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer Disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD.\nNucleus accumbens dopamine release reflects Bayesian inference during instrumental learning\nAuthors: Qu, A. J.; Tai, L.-H.; Hall, C. D.; Tu, E. M.; Eckstein, M. K.; Mischanchuk, K.; Lin, W. C.; Chase, J. B.; MacAskill, A. F.; Collins, A. G. E.; Gershman, S. J.; Wilbrecht, L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566306\nDopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal reward prediction error, the difference between observed and predicted reward, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches repeatedly. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals reflecting dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched the dopamine measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation plays a fundamental role in instrumental performance and associated mesolimbic dopamine signaling.\nNatural variability and individuality of walking behavior in Drosophila\nAuthors: Godesberg, V.; Bockemühl, T.; Büschges, A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567019\nInsects use walking behavior in a large number of contexts, such as exploration, foraging, escape and pursuit, or migration. A lot is known on how nervous systems produce this behavior in general and also how certain parameters vary with regard to walking direction or speed, for instance. An aspect that has not received much attention is if and how walking behavior varies across individuals of a particular species. To address this, we created a large corpus of kinematic walking data of many individuals of the fruit fly Drosophila. We only selected instances of straight walking in a narrow range of walking speeds to minimize the influence of these high-level parameters, aiming to uncover more subtle aspects of variability. Using high-speed videography and automated annotation we captured the positions of the six leg tips for thousands of steps and used principal components analysis to characterize the postural space individuals used during walking. Our analysis shows that the largest part of walking kinematics can be described by five principal components (PCs). Separation of these five PCs into a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional subspace was found to divide the description of walking behavior into invariant features shared across individuals and features that relate to the specifics of individuals; the latter features can be regarded as idiosyncrasies. We also demonstrate that this approach can detect the effects of experimental interventions in an unbiased manner and that general aspects of individuality, such as the average width of the individual walking posture, can be described.

        <p class="abstract">Being photosynthetic sessile organisms, plants established heliotropism to track the suns position across the sky and allow their vegetative parts to orient accordingly. Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal movement and behavior are critical to understanding ecological and evolutionary processes. Recent years have witnessed an increase in methodological and technological innovations in video-tracking solutions for phenotyping animal behavior. Although these advances enable the collection of high-resolution data describing the movement of multiple individuals, analyzing and interpreting them remains challenging due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and noisiness. Here, we introduce MoveR, an R package for importing, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing data from common video-tracking solutions. MoveR includes flexible tools for polishing data, removing tracking artifacts, subsetting and plotting individual paths, and computing different movement and behavior metrics.

        <p class="abstract">Behavioral interactions within the nuclear family may play a pivotal role in the emergence of autonomy and agency in mammals. While the emergence of a behavior may arise over weeks in line with nervous system maturation, individual events occur on sub-second time scales. This makes it uniquely challenging to track development in the lab where observations are made over minutes to hours or in ecological studies which lack individual specificity and sub-second precision. Here we study families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, raised in enlarged home-cage environments over weeks of development, using continuous video recordings to capture tens of millions of time points per family. Focusing on postnatal day 15 (when pups leave the nest) to day 30 (around the time when pups would disperse) we identify distinct developmental trajectories for both autonomous behaviors (exploration, food and water foraging), and social behaviors (huddling, approach, time spent together). Most of these behaviors emerge in concert with clear diurnal and crepuscular patterns and we find sex differences in both autonomous and social behaviors. Our work supports the emergence of distinct autonomous and social behavior phenotypes as the behavioral correlates of critical developmental periods of maturation of the rodent brain and can form the basis of future research on development from both neuroscience and behavioral biology perspectives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundUnderstanding the neurobiological substrates of psychiatric disorders requires comprehensive evaluations of cognitive and motivational functions in preclinical research settings. The translational validity of such evaluations will be supported by (1) tasks with high construct validity that are engaging and easy to teach to human and nonhuman participants, (2) software that enables efficient switching between multiple tasks in single sessions, (3) software that supports tasks across a broad range of physical experimental setups, and (4) by platform architectures that are easily extendable and customizable to encourage future optimization and development.

New MethodWe describe the Multi-task Universal Suite for Experiments (M-USE), a software platform designed to meet these requirements. It leverages the Unity video game engine and C# programming language to (1) support immersive and engaging tasks for humans and nonhuman primates, (2) allow experimenters or participants to switch between multiple tasks within-session, (3) generate builds that function across computers, tablets, and websites, and (4) is freely available online with documentation and tutorials for users and developers. M-USE includes a task library with seven pre-existing tasks assessing cognitive and motivational constructs of perception, attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, motivational and affective self-control, relational long-term memory, and visuo-spatial problem solving.

ResultsM-USE was used to test NHPs on up to six tasks per session, all available as part of the Task Library, and to extract performance metrics for all major cognitive and motivational constructs spanning the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institutes of Mental Health.

Comparison with Existing MethodsOther experiment design and control systems exist, but do not provide the full range of features available in M-USE, including a pre-existing task library for cross-species assessments; the ability to switch seamlessly between tasks in individual sessions; cross-platform build capabilities; license-free availability; and its leveraging of video-engine capabilities used to gamify tasks.

ConclusionsThe new multi-task platform facilitates cross-species translational research for understanding the neurobiological substrates of higher cognitive and motivational functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biodiversity loss is inextricably linked to declining human-nature &#34;connectedness&#34;, particularly in terms of how people form attitudes and beliefs about the natural world. Anthropomorphism, or attributing human-like qualities to non-human beings, is an increasingly common conservation strategy to encourage human connectedness to wildlife, but such strategies may also contribute to species persecution (e.g., &#34;bold&#34; and &#34;cunning&#34; predators). The public often ascribes psychological abilities to wildlife, but there have been limited efforts to link public wildlife attitudes to actual animal psychology research. Through a national level survey (n = 1, 373), we used a controlled experimental approach to test whether providing information on the boldness and problem-solving abilities of a wild carnivore, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), changed peoples tolerance of them. Half of participants were given information on fox psychology (video or a press release about fox boldness and problem-solving), the other half were given content unrelated to animal psychology (video or a press release about fox habitat use). While attitudes and beliefs related to overall tolerance were unaffected, our findings suggest that providing the public with information about animal psychology research, particularly through videos, may have a role in shaping human-wildlife connectedness by changing, either positively or negatively, other facets to peoples attitudes (e.g., interest factor), and that such effects may be more impactful than information about an animals basic ecology. If harnessed correctly, animal psychology research could offer a useful and unique platform for generating greater public awareness and engagement with the biodiversity crisis.

        <p class="abstract">Stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders are complex conditions that are difficult to diagnose and treat due to the variety of symptoms they present with. While animal models have been instrumental in understanding their underlying mechanisms, there is an ongoing debate about the validity of behavioral measures to address specific disorders. Here, we conducted an extensive ethological characterization of behavioral variables associated with anxiety and depression and employed a multidimensional approach to investigate stress susceptibility in male Wistar rats. The rats underwent inescapable footshocks (IS) or no-shocks (NS), followed by a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests over several days. Our study identified phenotypically distinct clusters, including fully characterized stress-susceptible and stress-resilient subpopulations, along with intermediate phenotypes. Reduced time in elevated plus maze open arms, diminished sucrose preference and increased escape failures consistently differentiated susceptible from resilient rats. Behavior in the forced swim test was unrelated to stress susceptibility. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the relationships between classical behavioral measures in animal models of depression, highlighting distinct patterns that differentiate susceptibility from resilience. It emphasizes the importance of a multidimensional assessment of behavioral responses in animal models for a better understanding of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIClustering of features reveals a correlation pattern that separates behavioral variables associated with susceptibility from those associated with resilience to stress
C_LIO_LIMultidimensional patterns of covariation among behavioral measures distinguish helpless from non-helpless individuals and indicate independence from forced swim test behavior.
C_LIO_LIClustering of individuals discriminates stressed subjects and reveals multidimensional behavioral phenotypes of resilience and susceptibility, indicating different stress-coping strategies.

        <p class="abstract">Some individuals have a disproportionate effect on group responses. These individuals may possess distinct attributes that differentiate them from others. These characteristics may include susceptibility to contaminant exposure such as cadmium, a potent trace metal present in water and food. Here, we tested whether a pair of cadmium-exposed individuals could exert an impact on the behavior of the unexposed majority. We used behavioral assessments to characterize the extent of the effects of the cadmium-exposed pair on group boldness, cohesion, activity and responses to landmarks. We found that groups with a pair of cadmium-exposed fish approached and remained closer to novel stimuli and landmarks than did groups with pairs of fish treated with uncontaminated water (control). Shoals with cadmium and water treated fish exhibited similar levels of cohesion and activity. The results suggest that fish acutely exposed to environmentally-relevant cadmium concentrations can have profound effects on the un-exposed majority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phosphodiesterase 2A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a&#43;/- mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a&#43;/- females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of GluR1 in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent LTD. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer Disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal reward prediction error, the difference between observed and predicted reward, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches repeatedly. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals reflecting dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched the dopamine measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation plays a fundamental role in instrumental performance and associated mesolimbic dopamine signaling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects use walking behavior in a large number of contexts, such as exploration, foraging, escape and pursuit, or migration. A lot is known on how nervous systems produce this behavior in general and also how certain parameters vary with regard to walking direction or speed, for instance. An aspect that has not received much attention is if and how walking behavior varies across individuals of a particular species. To address this, we created a large corpus of kinematic walking data of many individuals of the fruit fly Drosophila. We only selected instances of straight walking in a narrow range of walking speeds to minimize the influence of these high-level parameters, aiming to uncover more subtle aspects of variability. Using high-speed videography and automated annotation we captured the positions of the six leg tips for thousands of steps and used principal components analysis to characterize the postural space individuals used during walking. Our analysis shows that the largest part of walking kinematics can be described by five principal components (PCs). Separation of these five PCs into a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional subspace was found to divide the description of walking behavior into invariant features shared across individuals and features that relate to the specifics of individuals; the latter features can be regarded as idiosyncrasies. We also demonstrate that this approach can detect the effects of experimental interventions in an unbiased manner and that general aspects of individuality, such as the average width of the individual walking posture, can be described.
