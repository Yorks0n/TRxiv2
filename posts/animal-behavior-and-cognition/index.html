C.\nScore: 23.9, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569452\nSocial learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from \u003e400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.\nPrimate origins of human event cognition\nAuthors: Wilson, V. A. D.; Sauppe, S.; Brocard, S.; Ringen, E. J.; Daum, M. M.; Wermelinger, S.; Gu, N.; Andrews, C.; Isasi-Isasmendi, A.; Bickel, B.; Zuberbuehler, K.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568086\nHuman language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available. Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.\nWind Gates Search States in Free Flight\nAuthors: Stupski, S. D.; van Breugel, F.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569086\nFor any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise \"virtual\" olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped \"sink and circle\" search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and \"anemometric\" turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.\nIndividual recognition in a jumping spider (Phidippus regius)\nAuthors: Dahl, C. D.; Cheng, Y.\nScore: 33.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567545\nIndividual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.\nFlight behaviour diverges more between seasonal forms than between species in Pieris butterflies\nAuthors: Kleckova, I.; Linke, D.; Rezende, F.; Rauscher, L.; Le Roy, C.; Matos, P.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.568806\nIn flying animals, wing morphology jointly evolves with flight behaviours. Whether seasonal polymorphism in butterfly wing morphology is linked to divergent flight behaviour is however not known. Here we compared the flight behaviour and the morphology between the spring and the summer forms of two closely related, temperate species, Pieris napi and P. rapae. We first quantify three-dimensional flight behaviour by reconstructing individual flight trajectories using stereoscopic high-speed videography in an experimental cage. We then measure wing size and shape characteristics assumed to influence flight behaviours in butterflies. We show that seasonal, but not interspecific, differences in flight behaviour might be associated with divergent forewing shapes, either elongated or rounded wings. In Pieris spring forms, individuals are small and have elongated forewings, which are significantly correlated with low speed and acceleration, but with high flight curvature. Large Pieris summer individuals exhibit rounded forewings, which are correlated with high flight speed, turning acceleration, and advance ratio. We interpret such results as potentially adaptive flight behaviours in Pieris. Curvy flight trajectories in the spring forms may be a specialised foraging behaviour evolving in response to newly emerging feeding and oviposition resources. In contrast, the summer forms high flight speed and flight efficiency may be advantageous for dispersal to new habitats. Further, the recorded higher acceleration capacities of the summer form could have evolved in response to higher predation pressure. Our study provides quantitative evidence of divergent flight behaviours between seasonal forms of Pieris butterflies correlated with differences in wing morphology. Seasonal flight behaviour could be adaptive, possibly driven by the interaction of various seasonal selection pressures, including resource distribution (nectar and larval food plants), predator and parasitoid pressure, and thermoregulation.\nExperience reduces reliance on conspecifics for route selection by a collectively migrating soaring bird\nAuthors: Bronnvik, H.; Nourani, E.; Fiedler, W.; Flack, A.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.567993\nMigration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.\nNon-instructed Motor Skill Learning in Monkeys: Insights from Deep Reinforcement Learning Models\nAuthors: Carminatti, L.; Condro, L.; Riehle, A.; Grün, S.; Brochier, T.; Dauce, E.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569889\nIn the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: \"Time\" reflecting the time spent to perform a trial, and \"Power\" integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of `path selection', that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (\"Time\") and minimizing its metabolic cost (\"Power\"), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play.\nAdaptive algorithms for shaping behavior\nAuthors: Tong, W. L.; Iyer, A.; Murthy, V. N.; Reddy, G.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569774\nDogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks ('shaping'). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a machine learning framework for shaping animal behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its student's task based on the student's transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using autonomous teachers that plan a curriculum in a common sequence learning task, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks to carefully balance reinforcement and extinction. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on the sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping animal behavior.\nDo electromagnetic fields from subsea power cables effect elasmobranch behaviour? A risk-based approach for the Dutch Continental Shelf\nAuthors: Hermans, A.; Winter, H. V.; Gill, A. B.; Murk, A. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569531\nSubsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 microT) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.\nA female-biased gene expression signature of dominance in cooperatively breeding meerkats\nAuthors: Campbell, C. R.; Manser, M.; Shiratori, M.; Williams, K.; Barreiro, L.; Clutton-Brock, T. H.; Tung, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569325\nDominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Social learning within communities sometimes leads to behavioural patterns that persist over time, which we know as culture. Examples of culture include learned bird and whale songs, cetacean feeding techniques, and avian and mammalian migratory routes. Shaped by neutral and selective forces, animal cultures evolve dynamically and lead to cultural traditions that differ greatly in their diversity and stability. These cultural traits can influence individual and group survival, population structure, and even inform conservation efforts, underscoring the importance of understanding how other population processes interact with social learning to shape culture. Although the impact of social learning mechanisms and biases has been extensively explored, the role of demographic factors--such as population turnover, immigration, and age structure--on cultural evolution has received theoretical attention but rarely been subject to empirical investigation in natural populations. Doing so requires very complete trait sampling and detailed individual life history data, which are hard to acquire in combination. To this end, we built a multi-generational dataset containing over 109,000 songs from &gt;400 individuals from a population of Great Tits (Parus major), which we study using a deep metric learning model to re-identify individuals and quantify song similarity. We show that demographic variation at the small spatial scales at which learning takes place has the potential to strongly impact the pace and outcome of animal cultural evolution. For example, age distributions skewed towards older individuals are associated with slower cultural change and increased diversity, while higher local population turnover leads to elevated rates of cultural change. Our analyses support theoretical expectations for a key role of demographic processes resulting from individual behaviour in determining cultural evolution, and emphasize that these processes interact with species-specific factors such as the timing of song acquisition. Implications extend to large-scale cultural dynamics and the formation of dialects or traditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, decomposing events into causally-linked agent-patient roles, however, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent-patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent-patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent-patient relations and attended mostly to background information. We conclude that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

Significance statementHuman adults and great apes, but not human infants, track natural events as agent-patient relations, a cognitive foundation for syntax.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For any organism tracking a chemical cue to its source, the motion of its surrounding fluid provides crucial information for success. For both swimming and flying animals engaged in olfactory search, turning into the direction of oncoming wind or water current is often a critical first step [Marsh et al., 1978, Carton and Montgomery, 2003]. However, in nature, fluid flow may be turbulent or very still [Crall et al., 2017, Houle and van Breugel, 2023, Carvalho and Goncalves, 2020], and it is unclear how organisms adjust their search strategies accordingly due to the challenges of separately controlling flow and chemical encounters. Here, we use the genetic toolkit of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for olfaction [Benton, 2022], to develop an optogenetic paradigm to deliver temporally precise &#34;virtual&#34; olfactory experiences in free-flying animals while independently manipulating the wind conditions. We show that in free flight, Drosophila melanogaster adopt distinct search routines that are gated by whether they are flying in laminar wind or in still air. We first confirm that in laminar wind flies turn upwind, and further, we show that they achieve this using a rapid ballistic turn. In still air, flies adopt remarkably stereotyped &#34;sink and circle&#34; search state characterized by [~]60{degrees}turns at 3-4 Hz, biased in a consistent direction. In both laminar wind and still air, immediately after odor onset, flies decelerate and often perform a rapid turn. Both maneuvers are consistent with predictions from recent control theoretic analyses for how insects may estimate properties of wind while in flight [van Breugel, 2021, van Breugel et al., 2022]. We suggest that flies may use their deceleration and &#34;anemometric&#34; turn as active sensing maneuvers to rapidly gauge properties of their wind environment before initiating a proximal or upwind search routine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [1], for a review [2]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (Phidippus regius). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the  interest of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders identities. These results suggest that P. regius is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In flying animals, wing morphology jointly evolves with flight behaviours. Whether seasonal polymorphism in butterfly wing morphology is linked to divergent flight behaviour is however not known. Here we compared the flight behaviour and the morphology between the spring and the summer forms of two closely related, temperate species, Pieris napi and P. rapae. We first quantify three-dimensional flight behaviour by reconstructing individual flight trajectories using stereoscopic high-speed videography in an experimental cage. We then measure wing size and shape characteristics assumed to influence flight behaviours in butterflies. We show that seasonal, but not interspecific, differences in flight behaviour might be associated with divergent forewing shapes, either elongated or rounded wings. In Pieris spring forms, individuals are small and have elongated forewings, which are significantly correlated with low speed and acceleration, but with high flight curvature. Large Pieris summer individuals exhibit rounded forewings, which are correlated with high flight speed, turning acceleration, and advance ratio. We interpret such results as potentially adaptive flight behaviours in Pieris. Curvy flight trajectories in the spring forms may be a specialised foraging behaviour evolving in response to newly emerging feeding and oviposition resources. In contrast, the summer forms high flight speed and flight efficiency may be advantageous for dispersal to new habitats. Further, the recorded higher acceleration capacities of the summer form could have evolved in response to higher predation pressure. Our study provides quantitative evidence of divergent flight behaviours between seasonal forms of Pieris butterflies correlated with differences in wing morphology. Seasonal flight behaviour could be adaptive, possibly driven by the interaction of various seasonal selection pressures, including resource distribution (nectar and larval food plants), predator and parasitoid pressure, and thermoregulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Migration can be an energetically costly behavior with strong fitness consequences in terms of mortality and reproduction. The fact that costs and benefits may change with age and experience raises the question of whether experience changes the criteria that individuals use to select their migratory routes. Here we investigate the effect of age on route selection criteria in a collectively migrating soaring bird, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). We perform step selection analysis on a longitudinal data set tracking 158 white storks over up to nine years to quantify how they select their routes on the basis of the social and atmospheric environments, and to examine how this selection changes with age. We find clear ontogenetic shifts in route selection criteria. Juveniles choose routes that have good atmospheric conditions and high conspecific densities. Yet, as they gain experience storks selection on the availability of social information reduces--after their fifth migration experienced birds also choose routes with low conspecific densities. Thus, our results suggest that as individuals age, they gradually replace information gleaned from other individuals with information gained from experience, allowing them to shift their migration timing and increasing the time scale at which they select their routes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the field of motor learning, few studies have addressed the case of non-instructed movement sequences learning, as they require long periods of training and data acquisition, and are complex to interpret. In contrast, such problems are readily addressed in machine learning, using artificial agents in simulated environments. To understand the mechanisms that drive the learning behavior of two macaque monkeys in a free-moving multi-target reaching task, we created two Reinforcement Learning (RL) models with different penalty criteria: &#34;Time&#34; reflecting the time spent to perform a trial, and &#34;Power&#34; integrating the energy cost. The initial phase of the learning process is characterized by a rapid improvement in motor performance for both the 2 monkeys and the 2 models, with hand trajectories becoming shorter and smoother while the velocity gradually increases along trials and sessions. This improvement in motor performance with training is associated with a simplification in the trajectory of the movements performed to achieve the task goal. The monkeys and models show a convergent evolution towards an optimal circular motor path, almost exclusively in counter-clockwise direction, and a persistent inter-trial variability. All these elements contribute to interpreting monkeys learning in the terms of a progressive updating of action-selection patterns, following a classic value iteration scheme as in reinforcement learning. However, in contrast with our models, the monkeys also show a specific variability in the choice of the motor sequences to carry out across trials. This variability reflects a form of `path selection&#39;, that is absent in the models. Furthermore, comparing models and behavioral data also reveal sub-optimality in the way monkeys manage the trade-off between optimizing movement duration (&#34;Time&#34;) and minimizing its metabolic cost (&#34;Power&#34;), with a tendency to overemphasize one criterion at the detriment of the other one. Overall, this study reveals the subtle interplay between cognitive factors, biomechanical constraints, task achievement and motor efficacy management in motor learning, and highlights the relevance of modeling approaches in revealing the respective contribution of the different elements at play.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dogs and laboratory mice are commonly trained to perform complex tasks by guiding them through a curriculum of simpler tasks (&#39;shaping&#39;). What are the principles behind effective shaping strategies? Here, we propose a machine learning framework for shaping animal behavior, where an autonomous teacher agent decides its student&#39;s task based on the student&#39;s transcript of successes and failures on previously assigned tasks. Using autonomous teachers that plan a curriculum in a common sequence learning task, we show that near-optimal shaping algorithms adaptively alternate between simpler and harder tasks to carefully balance reinforcement and extinction. Based on this intuition, we derive an adaptive shaping heuristic with minimal parameters, which we show is near-optimal on the sequence learning task and robustly trains deep reinforcement learning agents on navigation tasks that involve sparse, delayed rewards. Extensions to continuous curricula are explored. Our work provides a starting point towards a general computational framework for shaping animal behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Subsea power cables cause electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into the marine environment. Elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks) are particularly sensitive to EMFs as they use electromagnetic-receptive sensory systems for orientation, navigation and locating conspecifics or buried prey. Cables may intersect with egg laying sites, foraging habitat and migration routes of elasmobranchs and the effects of encountering EMFs on species of elasmobranchs are largely unknown. Demonstrated behavioural effects are attraction, disturbance and indifference, depending on EMF characteristics, exposed life stage, exposure level and duration. We estimated exposure levels of elasmobranchs to subsea cable EMFs, based on modelled magnetic fields in the Dutch Continental Shelf and compared these to reported elasmobranch sensory sensitivity ranges and experimental effect levels. We conclude that the risk from subsea power cables has a large uncertainty and varies per life stage and species ecology. Based on estimated no-observed effect levels (from 10-3 to 10-1 microT) we discuss what will probably be the most affected species and life stage for six common benthic elasmobranchs in the Southern North Sea. We identify critical knowledge gaps for reducing the uncertainty in the risk assessments for EMFs effects on elasmobranchs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dominance is a primary determinant of social dynamics and resource access in social animals. Recent studies show that dominance is also reflected in the gene regulatory profiles of peripheral immune cells. However, the strength and direction of this relationship differs across the species and sex combinations investigated, potentially due to variation in the predictors and energetic consequences of dominant status. To test this possibility, we investigated the association between social status and gene expression in the blood of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta; n=113 unique individuals), including in response to lipopolysaccharide, Gardiquimod, and glucocorticoid stimulation. Meerkats are cooperatively breeding social carnivores in which breeding females physically outcompete other females to suppress reproduction, resulting in high reproductive skew. They therefore present an opportunity to disentangle the effects of social dominance from those of sex per se. We identify a sex-specific signature of dominance, including 1,045 differentially expressed genes in females but none in males. Dominant females exhibit elevated activity in innate immune pathways and an exacerbated response to LPS challenge. In this respect, female meerkats resemble wild male baboons (for which similar data are available), where physical competition is also central to determining rank hierarchies and mating effort is high. However, they differ from female primates in which social status is nepotistically determined. Our results support the hypothesis that the gene regulatory signature of social status depends on the determinants and energetic costs of social dominance. They also support potential life history trade-offs between investment in reproduction versus somatic maintenance.</p>
