This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.\nSound-seeking before and after hearing loss in mice\nAuthors: Mai, J.; Gargiullo, R.; Zheng, M.; Esho, V.; Hussein, O. E.; Pollay, E.; Bowe, C.; Williamson, L. M.; McElroy, A. F.; Goolsby, W. N.; Brooks, K. A.; Rodgers, C. C.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574475\nHow we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.\nVocalization Patterns in Laying Hens - An Analysis of Stress-Induced Audio Responses\nAuthors: Neethirajan, S.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573338\nThis study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.\nLong mounting with repeated copulations in Zygogramma bicolorata: A test of adaptive significance of a curious mating behaviour\nAuthors: Pal, R. S.; Bhowmick, A.; Naik, K.; Nandy, B.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574980\nLong matings are abundant in insects despite the range of the costs involved. The causes and consequences of the evolution of long matings remain an interesting problem for behavioural ecologists. We studied the Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata), which is known to show extraordinarily long copulations. Our detailed investigation showed, for the first time, that the long mounting in this species entails repeated copulation. Each of these copulations is preceded and succeeded by a leg-rubbing behaviour. We found the same characteristic pattern in laboratory and semi-natural conditions. We conducted a series of interrupted mounting assays to examine the fitness consequences of the duration of mounting. We tested multiple hypotheses regarding the transfer of sperm and non-sperm components, and the function of leg rubbing in modulating the female copulatory behaviour. Sperm transfer and fertility did not exhibit a linear increase with the number of copulations. There was also no evidence of nutrient transfer by the males. In contrast, our experiments reveal significant cost of long mounting in these beetles. We showed female remating behaviour can be modulated by the long previous mounting. Our data also suggest that leg rubbing may reduce female resistance to mating. While the long mating possibly serves as copulatory mate guarding, the males may increase their competitive ability through modulating female remating. We also propose leg rubbing to be a copulatory courtship behaviour. Our study provides preliminary insights into the evolution of long mating in such systems and necessitates further research on sexual selection.\nSubtle, but perceptible, sexual dichromatism and disassortative mating based on plumage reflectance in Black Terns (Chlidonias niger)\nAuthors: Baldassarre, D. T.; Davis, K. M.; Shealer, D. A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575209\nIn birds, sexual selection on plumage often leads to sexual dichromatism and male ornamentation. However, even in drab species with no obvious sexual dichromatism, both sexes may still use plumage for mate choice. A previous study found weak sexual size dimorphism in North American Black Terns (Chlidonias niger surinamensis), but no assortative mating based on morphology. However, the relevance of plumage variation to mate choice is yet untested. Here, using reflectance spectrometry and avian visual modeling revealed that Black Tern males and females exhibited a subtle but significant difference in brightness (males darker). Importantly, the achromatic contrast between the sexes should be perceptible during mate choice. Moreover, there was evidence of disassortative mating for plumage color, but not brightness: more black and saturated birds paired with more gray and unsaturated birds. There was no relationship between plumage color or brightness and body mass. This finding suggests that visual signals unrelated to body condition may be relevant to Black Tern mate choice. The pattern of disassortative mating was unexpected, and potential benefits of choosing a mate dissimilar from oneself are discussed. This study highlights the importance of considering the avian visual system when studying plumage variation elusive to human observers.\nAutomated behavioral analysis reveals that mice employ a bait-and-switch escape mechanism to de-escalate social conflict.\nAuthors: Clein, R.; Warren, M.; Neunuebel, J. P.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575321\nIntraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male's behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.\nUrban sensory conditions alter rival interactions and mate choice in urban and forest tungara frogs\nAuthors: Smit, J. A. H.; Thijssen, V.; Cronin, A. D.; Ellers, J.; Halfwerk, W.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575508\nSexual communication often takes place in networks with multiple competing signallers being simultaneously assessed by mate choosers. Altered sensory conditions, such as noise and light pollution, can affect communication by altering signal production and perception. While evidence of sensory pollution affecting sexual signalling is widespread, few studies assess impacts on sexual signalling during rival interactions as well as mate choice, let alone whether urban and forest populations have diverged in their response. Here, we investigate the effects of urban sensory conditions on sexual communication in urban and forest tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). We recorded dyadic vocal rival interactions and assessed mate choice with and without noise and light pollution in the lab. We show that urban sensory conditions can directly impact the intensity of rival interactions, differences between rivals and mate choice, though changes were often in opposite directions for frogs of urban and forest origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in rival interactions in response to light and noise pollution can also indirectly affect how females choose between potential mates. Our study reveals origin-dependent direct and indirect effects of noise and light pollution, which ultimately translate into fitness consequences for sexual communication in urban populations.\nThe impact of kinship composition on social structure\nAuthors: Pereira, A. D. S.; Pavez-Fox, M. A.; Hart, J. D. A.; Negron-Del Valle, J. E.; Phillips, D.; Casanova, C.; De Moor, D.; Brent, L. J. N.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575037\nThe relatedness between group members is a potential driver of variation in social structure. Relatedness predicts biases in partner choice and formation of strong relationships among group members. As such, groups that differ in their percentage of non-kin dyads, i.e., in their kinship composition, should therefore differ in the structure of their social networks. Yet the relationship between kinship composition and social structure remains unclear. Here, we used long-term social and pedigree data from a population of rhesus macaques to investigate the relationship between kinship composition and the connectivity, cohesion, potential for transmission and social differentiation of the social networks of adult female macaques. We found no evidence that the social structure of groups composed of greater proportion of unrelated females differ from that of groups with a lower proportion of non-kin. To investigate this unexpected finding, we built agent-based models parameterised with the empirical data to further explore (1) the expected relationship between kinship composition and social structure and (2) why we did not find such a relationship in the empirical data. Agent-based models showed that kinship composition can influence social structure in populations similar to the one studied, but that this effect may only be detectable with a sample size even larger than ours (19 group-years) and with greater variance in kinship composition (proportion of non-kin varied between 0.830-0.922 in the empirical data). The relationship between kinship composition and social structure might be more apparent when comparing data from species that differ strongly in their social organisation, translating into marked differences in kinship composition. This further emphasises the importance of reporting existing and future kinship composition data to deepen our understanding of the evolution of sociality and highlights the potential of agent-based models to better understand empirical results.\nA bibliometric analysis of neurobiological and behavioraldisturbances of cafeteria diet interventions\nAuthors: Lopez-Castro, A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574927\nObesity is a global epidemic mainly caused by the overconsumption of western diets, high in fat and sugars. Cafeteria diet administered to rodents is an effective model of the metabolic, neurobiological, and behavioral disturbances caused by the over consumption of western diet in humans. However, this is still an emerging research field. To provide information about the past, present and future of the research field, this study aims to explore the research field of cafeteria diet and behavior through bibliometric analysis. Original articles on cafeteria diet and behavior were obtained from Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2013 to Octuber 30, 2023. The R packages litsearchr, bibliometrix, sjrdata and mblm were used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Linear regression, concept mapping and trend analysis were used for relationship analysis. 85 articles included from 457 authors, 20 countries and 56 institutions were included. 46 from Pubmed, 12 from Scopus and 27 from Web of Science. The 25 topmost productive authors were from Spain, Brazil, Australia, Switzerland, and USA. 15 authors had an h-index higher than 3. The institution with the largest production of articles is the University of South Wales with 10 articles. A simple linear regression could not establish significance between the relationship between the impact factor and the number of citations received. In addition, a conceptual structure map was performed, and 5 clusters were found. Finally, by a bi-factor analysis, a trend topic established that anxiety is the term currently in trend and since 2017 in the cafeteria diet and behavior research field. The present study explores the performance of authors, countries, institutions, and journals on classical measures of scientific parameters. This helped to model multiple correspondence and trend analyses that provide a reliable source of information to direct research on cafeteria diet interventions.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In some species, such as chameleon and cichlid fish, rapid body colouration changes (within seconds or minutes) serve as visual social signals in male-male competition. This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long matings are abundant in insects despite the range of the costs involved. The causes and consequences of the evolution of long matings remain an interesting problem for behavioural ecologists. We studied the Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata), which is known to show extraordinarily long copulations. Our detailed investigation showed, for the first time, that the long mounting in this species entails repeated copulation. Each of these copulations is preceded and succeeded by a leg-rubbing behaviour. We found the same characteristic pattern in laboratory and semi-natural conditions. We conducted a series of interrupted mounting assays to examine the fitness consequences of the duration of mounting. We tested multiple hypotheses regarding the transfer of sperm and non-sperm components, and the function of leg rubbing in modulating the female copulatory behaviour. Sperm transfer and fertility did not exhibit a linear increase with the number of copulations. There was also no evidence of nutrient transfer by the males. In contrast, our experiments reveal significant cost of long mounting in these beetles. We showed female remating behaviour can be modulated by the long previous mounting. Our data also suggest that leg rubbing may reduce female resistance to mating. While the long mating possibly serves as copulatory mate guarding, the males may increase their competitive ability through modulating female remating. We also propose leg rubbing to be a copulatory courtship behaviour. Our study provides preliminary insights into the evolution of long mating in such systems and necessitates further research on sexual selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In birds, sexual selection on plumage often leads to sexual dichromatism and male ornamentation. However, even in drab species with no obvious sexual dichromatism, both sexes may still use plumage for mate choice. A previous study found weak sexual size dimorphism in North American Black Terns (Chlidonias niger surinamensis), but no assortative mating based on morphology. However, the relevance of plumage variation to mate choice is yet untested. Here, using reflectance spectrometry and avian visual modeling revealed that Black Tern males and females exhibited a subtle but significant difference in brightness (males darker). Importantly, the achromatic contrast between the sexes should be perceptible during mate choice. Moreover, there was evidence of disassortative mating for plumage color, but not brightness: more black and saturated birds paired with more gray and unsaturated birds. There was no relationship between plumage color or brightness and body mass. This finding suggests that visual signals unrelated to body condition may be relevant to Black Tern mate choice. The pattern of disassortative mating was unexpected, and potential benefits of choosing a mate dissimilar from oneself are discussed. This study highlights the importance of considering the avian visual system when studying plumage variation elusive to human observers.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male&#39;s behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sexual communication often takes place in networks with multiple competing signallers being simultaneously assessed by mate choosers. Altered sensory conditions, such as noise and light pollution, can affect communication by altering signal production and perception. While evidence of sensory pollution affecting sexual signalling is widespread, few studies assess impacts on sexual signalling during rival interactions as well as mate choice, let alone whether urban and forest populations have diverged in their response. Here, we investigate the effects of urban sensory conditions on sexual communication in urban and forest tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). We recorded dyadic vocal rival interactions and assessed mate choice with and without noise and light pollution in the lab. We show that urban sensory conditions can directly impact the intensity of rival interactions, differences between rivals and mate choice, though changes were often in opposite directions for frogs of urban and forest origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in rival interactions in response to light and noise pollution can also indirectly affect how females choose between potential mates. Our study reveals origin-dependent direct and indirect effects of noise and light pollution, which ultimately translate into fitness consequences for sexual communication in urban populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The relatedness between group members is a potential driver of variation in social structure. Relatedness predicts biases in partner choice and formation of strong relationships among group members. As such, groups that differ in their percentage of non-kin dyads, i.e., in their kinship composition, should therefore differ in the structure of their social networks. Yet the relationship between kinship composition and social structure remains unclear. Here, we used long-term social and pedigree data from a population of rhesus macaques to investigate the relationship between kinship composition and the connectivity, cohesion, potential for transmission and social differentiation of the social networks of adult female macaques. We found no evidence that the social structure of groups composed of greater proportion of unrelated females differ from that of groups with a lower proportion of non-kin. To investigate this unexpected finding, we built agent-based models parameterised with the empirical data to further explore (1) the expected relationship between kinship composition and social structure and (2) why we did not find such a relationship in the empirical data. Agent-based models showed that kinship composition can influence social structure in populations similar to the one studied, but that this effect may only be detectable with a sample size even larger than ours (19 group-years) and with greater variance in kinship composition (proportion of non-kin varied between 0.830-0.922 in the empirical data). The relationship between kinship composition and social structure might be more apparent when comparing data from species that differ strongly in their social organisation, translating into marked differences in kinship composition. This further emphasises the importance of reporting existing and future kinship composition data to deepen our understanding of the evolution of sociality and highlights the potential of agent-based models to better understand empirical results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Obesity is a global epidemic mainly caused by the overconsumption of western diets, high in fat and sugars. Cafeteria diet administered to rodents is an effective model of the metabolic, neurobiological, and behavioral disturbances caused by the over consumption of western diet in humans. However, this is still an emerging research field. To provide information about the past, present and future of the research field, this study aims to explore the research field of cafeteria diet and behavior through bibliometric analysis. Original articles on cafeteria diet and behavior were obtained from Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2013 to Octuber 30, 2023. The R packages litsearchr, bibliometrix, sjrdata and mblm were used for descriptive and inferential statistics. Linear regression, concept mapping and trend analysis were used for relationship analysis. 85 articles included from 457 authors, 20 countries and 56 institutions were included. 46 from Pubmed, 12 from Scopus and 27 from Web of Science. The 25 topmost productive authors were from Spain, Brazil, Australia, Switzerland, and USA. 15 authors had an h-index higher than 3. The institution with the largest production of articles is the University of South Wales with 10 articles. A simple linear regression could not establish significance between the relationship between the impact factor and the number of citations received. In addition, a conceptual structure map was performed, and 5 clusters were found. Finally, by a bi-factor analysis, a trend topic established that anxiety is the term currently in trend and since 2017 in the cafeteria diet and behavior research field. The present study explores the performance of authors, countries, institutions, and journals on classical measures of scientific parameters. This helped to model multiple correspondence and trend analyses that provide a reliable source of information to direct research on cafeteria diet interventions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>
