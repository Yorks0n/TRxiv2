In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nPregnancy-associated oxidative stress and inflammation are not associated with impaired maternal neuronal activity or memory function\nAuthors: Bradshaw, J. L.; Wilson, E. N.; Gardner, J. J.; Mabry, S.; Tucker, S. M.; Rybalchenko, N.; Vera, E.; Goulopoulou, S.; Cunningham, R. L.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577461\nPregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX(R) magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [\u0026le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [\u0026le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [\u0026le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.\nSociality shapes the life histories of animals along the fast-slow continuum, but does not affect their senescence\nAuthors: Salguero-Gomez, R.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.575897\nThe role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.\nExploring the Categorical Nature of Colour Perception: Insights from Deep Networks\nAuthors: Akbarinia, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577209\nThis study delves into the categorical aspects of colour perception, employing the odd-one-out paradigm on artificial neural networks. We reveal a significant alignment between human data and unimodal vision networks (e.g., ImageNet object recognition). Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP text-image matching) account for the remaining unexplained data even in non-linguistic experiments. These results suggest that categorical colour perception is a language-independent representation, albeit partly shaped by linguistic colour terms during its development. Exploring the ubiquity of colour categories in Taskonomy unimodal vision networks highlights the task-dependent nature of colour categories, predominantly in semantic and 3D tasks, with a notable absence in low-level tasks. To explain this difference, we analysed kernels responses before the winnertaking-all, observing that networks with mismatching colour categories align in continuous representations. Our findings quantify the dual influence of visual signals and linguistic factors in categorical colour perception, thereby formalising a harmonious reconciliation of the universal and relative debates.\nArtificial Sweeteners in US-Marketed Oral Nicotine Pouch Products: Correlation with Nicotine Contents and Effects on Product Preference\nAuthors: Jabba, S. V.; Silinski, P.; Yang, A. Y.; Ouyang, W.; Jordt, S. E.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577472\nIntroductionArtificial sweeteners are listed as ingredients of oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), a new product category with rapidly growing market share. The exact sweetener contents of ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior. Aims and MethodsArtificial sweetener contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Sweetener effects during the initiation of ONP consumption were modeled in single- and two-bottle tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type mice and mice deficient in the sweet taste receptor (Tas1r2-/-). ResultsAcesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs ([~]0.3-0.9 mg/pouch), including products marketed as \"Unflavored\" or \"Flavor ban approved\". In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (0.6-1.2 mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice. ConclusionsONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners, with some brands adding more sweetener to ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitates consumption of ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Sweetness is a key determinant of ONP use initiation, likely reducing the aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents. ImplicationsArtificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and facilitate initiation and continued consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as \"Unflavored\" of \"Flavor ban-approved\" suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.\nNon-contact detection of pyrethroids widely used in vector control by Anopheles mosquitoes\nAuthors: KAMBOU, S. S.; VALENTE, A.; AGNEW, P.; Hien, D. F. d. S.; YERBANGA, R. S.; MOIROUX, N.; DABIRE, K. R.; PENNETIER, C.; COHUET, A.; CARRASCO, D.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577675\nPyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides to control vector borne diseases including malaria. Physiological resistance mechanisms to these insecticides have been well described, whereas those for behavioral resistance remain overlooked. Field data suggest the presence of spatial sensory detection by Anopheles mosquitoes of the pyrethroid molecules used in insecticide-based control tools, such as long-lasting insecticide nets or insecticide residual spraying, opening the way to the emergence of a wide range of behavioral adaptations among malaria vectors. However, the spatial sensory detection of these molecules is controversial and needs to be demonstrated. The goal of this study was to behaviorally characterize the non-contact detection of three of the most common pyrethroids used for malaria vector control: permethrin, deltamethrin an -cypermethrin. To reach this goal, we recorded the behavior (takeoff response) of Anopheles gambiae pyrethroid-sensitive and resistant laboratory strains, as well as field collected mosquitoes from the Gambiae complex, when exposed to the headspace of bottles containing different doses of the insecticides at 25 and 35{degrees}C, in order to represent a range of laboratory and field temperatures. We found the proportion of laboratory susceptible and resistant female mosquitoes that took off was, in all treatments, dose and the temperature dependent. Sensitive mosquitoes were significantly more prone to take off only in the presence of -cypermethrin, whereas sensitive and resistant mosquitoes showed similar responses to permethrin and deltamethrin. Field-collected mosquitoes of the Gambiae complex were also responsive to permethrin, independently of the species identity (An. gambiae, An. coluzzi and An. arabiensis) or their genotypes for the kdr mutation, known to confer resistance to pyrethroids. The observed ability of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes to detect insecticides without contact could favor the evolution of behavioral modifications that may allow them to avoid or reduce the adverse effect of insecticides and thus, the development of behavioral resistance.\nBeyond a unitary construct: Dissecting stopping behaviour in two bird species\nAuthors: Troisi, C. A.; Vernouillet, A.; Allaert, R.; Knoch, S.; Martel, A.; Lens, L.; Verbruggen, F.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575695\nThe ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in going and stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.\nBold zebrafish (danio rerio) learn faster in an associative learning task\nAuthors: Corcoran, J.; Storks, L.; Wong, R. Y.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578005\nAnimals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.\nThoughtful faces: inferring internal states across species using facial features\nAuthors: Tlaie, A.; Abd El Hay, M. Y.; Mert, B.; Taylor, R.; Ferracci, P. A.; Shapcott, K. A.; Glukhova, M.; Pillow, J. W.; Havenith, M. N.; Scholvinck, M.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577055\nAnimal behaviour is shaped to a large degree by internal cognitive states, but it is unknown whether these states are similar across species. To address this question, we developed a virtual reality setup in which mice and macaques engage in the same naturalistic visual foraging task. We exploited the richness of a wide range of facial features extracted from video recordings during the task, to train a Markov-Switching Linear Regression (MSLR). By doing so, we identified, on a single-trial basis, a set of internal states that reliably predicted when the animals were going to react. At any one moment, one state was dominant, and mice transitioned through these dominant states faster than monkeys. The model could predict not only reaction time, but also task outcome, supporting the behavioural relevance of the inferred states. The thus characterised states were similar between mice and monkeys. Thus, we were able to flexibly and agnostically track the dynamics of several internal states, identifying general principles of naturalistic cognitive processing across species.\nAmelioration of age-related cognitive decline and anxiety in mice by Centella asiatica extract varies by sex, dose and mode of administration.\nAuthors: Gray, N. E.; Hack, W.; Brandes, M.; Zweig, J. A.; Yang, L.; Marney, L.; Choi, J.; Magana, A. A.; Cerruit, N.; McFerrin, J.; Koike, S.; Nguyen, T.; Raber, J.; Quinn, J. F.; Maier, C. S.; Soumyanath, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576700\nWe have previously reported that a water extract (CAW) of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica administered in drinking water can improve cognitive deficits in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we compared the effects of CAW administered in drinking water or the diet on cognition, measures of anxiety and depression-like behavior in healthy aged mice. Three- and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were administered rodent AIN-93M diet containing CAW (0, 0.2, 0.5 or 1% w/w) to provide 0, 200 mg/kg/d, 500 mg/kg/d or 1000 mg/kg/d for a total of 5 weeks. An additional group of eighteen-month-old mice were treated with CAW (10 mg/mL) in their drinking water for a total of five weeks to deliver the same exposure of CAW as the highest dietary dose (1000 mg/kg/d). CAW doses delivered were calculated based on food and water consumption measured in previous experiments. In the fourth and fifth weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing of cognition, anxiety and depression (n=12 of each sex per treatment group in each test). Aged mice of both sexes showed cognitive deficits relative to young mice while only female aged mice showed increased anxiety compared to the young female mice and no differences in depression were observed between the different ages. CAW (1000 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water improved deficits in aged mice in learning, executive function and recognition memory in both sexes and attenuated the increased measures of anxiety observed in the aged female mice. However, CAW in the diet only improved executive function in aged mice at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/d) in both sexes and did so less robustly than when given in the water. There were no effects of CAW on depression-like behavior in aged animals regardless of whether it was administered in the diet or the water. These results suggest that CAW can ameliorate age-related changes in measures of anxiety and cognition and that the mode of administration is important for the effects of CAW on resilience to these age-related changes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX(R) magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [&amp;le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [&amp;le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [&amp;le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study delves into the categorical aspects of colour perception, employing the odd-one-out paradigm on artificial neural networks. We reveal a significant alignment between human data and unimodal vision networks (e.g., ImageNet object recognition). Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP text-image matching) account for the remaining unexplained data even in non-linguistic experiments. These results suggest that categorical colour perception is a language-independent representation, albeit partly shaped by linguistic colour terms during its development. Exploring the ubiquity of colour categories in Taskonomy unimodal vision networks highlights the task-dependent nature of colour categories, predominantly in semantic and 3D tasks, with a notable absence in low-level tasks. To explain this difference, we analysed kernels responses before the winnertaking-all, observing that networks with mismatching colour categories align in continuous representations. Our findings quantify the dual influence of visual signals and linguistic factors in categorical colour perception, thereby formalising a harmonious reconciliation of the universal and relative debates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionArtificial sweeteners are listed as ingredients of oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), a new product category with rapidly growing market share. The exact sweetener contents of ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior.

Aims and MethodsArtificial sweetener contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Sweetener effects during the initiation of ONP consumption were modeled in single- and two-bottle tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type mice and mice deficient in the sweet taste receptor (Tas1r2-/-).

ResultsAcesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs ([~]0.3-0.9 mg/pouch), including products marketed as &#34;Unflavored&#34; or &#34;Flavor ban approved&#34;. In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (0.6-1.2 mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice.

ConclusionsONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners, with some brands adding more sweetener to ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitates consumption of ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Sweetness is a key determinant of ONP use initiation, likely reducing the aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents.

ImplicationsArtificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and facilitate initiation and continued consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as &#34;Unflavored&#34; of &#34;Flavor ban-approved&#34; suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pyrethroids are the most widely used insecticides to control vector borne diseases including malaria. Physiological resistance mechanisms to these insecticides have been well described, whereas those for behavioral resistance remain overlooked. Field data suggest the presence of spatial sensory detection by Anopheles mosquitoes of the pyrethroid molecules used in insecticide-based control tools, such as long-lasting insecticide nets or insecticide residual spraying, opening the way to the emergence of a wide range of behavioral adaptations among malaria vectors. However, the spatial sensory detection of these molecules is controversial and needs to be demonstrated. The goal of this study was to behaviorally characterize the non-contact detection of three of the most common pyrethroids used for malaria vector control: permethrin, deltamethrin an -cypermethrin. To reach this goal, we recorded the behavior (takeoff response) of Anopheles gambiae pyrethroid-sensitive and resistant laboratory strains, as well as field collected mosquitoes from the Gambiae complex, when exposed to the headspace of bottles containing different doses of the insecticides at 25 and 35{degrees}C, in order to represent a range of laboratory and field temperatures. We found the proportion of laboratory susceptible and resistant female mosquitoes that took off was, in all treatments, dose and the temperature dependent. Sensitive mosquitoes were significantly more prone to take off only in the presence of -cypermethrin, whereas sensitive and resistant mosquitoes showed similar responses to permethrin and deltamethrin. Field-collected mosquitoes of the Gambiae complex were also responsive to permethrin, independently of the species identity (An. gambiae, An. coluzzi and An. arabiensis) or their genotypes for the kdr mutation, known to confer resistance to pyrethroids. The observed ability of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes to detect insecticides without contact could favor the evolution of behavioral modifications that may allow them to avoid or reduce the adverse effect of insecticides and thus, the development of behavioral resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of  going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of  stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in  going and  stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals differ in their ability to learn. One potential factor contributing to learning differences is personality types. We investigated the relationship between learning and the bold-shy continuum by testing learning performance of bold and shy zebrafish across two associative learning tasks: conditioned place preference (CPP) and 2 choice. Bold fish learned significantly faster than the shy fish but there were no differences in the magnitude of change in behavior between the personality types in CPP. When tested in the 2 choice task, we found no clear evidence of learning between personality types or controls. Overall, our study suggests that bold fish tend to be faster learners when compared to shy fish. The lack of differences in the final change in behavior suggests that the learning difference is due to neophobic tendencies and resulting initial interactions with the learning stimulus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal behaviour is shaped to a large degree by internal cognitive states, but it is unknown whether these states are similar across species. To address this question, we developed a virtual reality setup in which mice and macaques engage in the same naturalistic visual foraging task. We exploited the richness of a wide range of facial features extracted from video recordings during the task, to train a Markov-Switching Linear Regression (MSLR). By doing so, we identified, on a single-trial basis, a set of internal states that reliably predicted when the animals were going to react. At any one moment, one state was dominant, and mice transitioned through these dominant states faster than monkeys. The model could predict not only reaction time, but also task outcome, supporting the behavioural relevance of the inferred states. The thus characterised states were similar between mice and monkeys. Thus, we were able to flexibly and agnostically track the dynamics of several internal states, identifying general principles of naturalistic cognitive processing across species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We have previously reported that a water extract (CAW) of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica administered in drinking water can improve cognitive deficits in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we compared the effects of CAW administered in drinking water or the diet on cognition, measures of anxiety and depression-like behavior in healthy aged mice.

Three- and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were administered rodent AIN-93M diet containing CAW (0, 0.2, 0.5 or 1% w/w) to provide 0, 200 mg/kg/d, 500 mg/kg/d or 1000 mg/kg/d for a total of 5 weeks. An additional group of eighteen-month-old mice were treated with CAW (10 mg/mL) in their drinking water for a total of five weeks to deliver the same exposure of CAW as the highest dietary dose (1000 mg/kg/d). CAW doses delivered were calculated based on food and water consumption measured in previous experiments. In the fourth and fifth weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing of cognition, anxiety and depression (n=12 of each sex per treatment group in each test).

Aged mice of both sexes showed cognitive deficits relative to young mice while only female aged mice showed increased anxiety compared to the young female mice and no differences in depression were observed between the different ages. CAW (1000 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water improved deficits in aged mice in learning, executive function and recognition memory in both sexes and attenuated the increased measures of anxiety observed in the aged female mice. However, CAW in the diet only improved executive function in aged mice at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/d) in both sexes and did so less robustly than when given in the water. There were no effects of CAW on depression-like behavior in aged animals regardless of whether it was administered in the diet or the water.

These results suggest that CAW can ameliorate age-related changes in measures of anxiety and cognition and that the mode of administration is important for the effects of CAW on resilience to these age-related changes.</p>
