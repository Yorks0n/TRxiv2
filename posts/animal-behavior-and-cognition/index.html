L.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563859\nPrey-predator interactions have resulted in the evolution of many anti-predatory traits. One of them is the ability for prey to listen to predators and avoid them. Although prey anti-predatory behavioural responses to predator auditory cues are well described in a wide range of taxa, studies on whether butterflies change their behaviours in response to their predatory calls are lacking. Heliconius butterflies are unpalatable and form Mullerian mimicry rings as morphological defence strategies against their bird predators. Like many other butterflies in the Nymphalidae family, Heliconius butterflies possess auditory organs, which are hypothesized to have evolved to assist with predator detection. Here we test whether Heliconius melpomene change their behaviour in response to their predatory bird calls by observing the behaviour of male and female H. m. plessini exposed to calls of Heliconius avian predators: rufous-tailed jacamar, migratory Eastern kingbird, and resident tropical kingbird. We also exposed them to the calls of the toco toucan, a frugivorous bird as a control bird call, and an amplified greenhouse background noise as a noise control. We found that individuals changed their behaviour in response to jacamar calls only. Males increased their walking and fluttering behaviour, while females did not change their behaviour during the playback of the jacamar call. Intersexual behaviours like courtship, copulation, and abdomen lifting did not change in response to bird calls. Our findings suggest that despite having primary predatory defences like toxicity and being in a mimicry ring, H. m. plessini butterflies changed their behaviour in response to predator calls. Furthermore, this response was predator specific, as H. m. plesseni did not respond to either the Eastern kingbird or the tropic kingbird calls. This suggests that Heliconius butterflies may be able to differentiate predatory calls, and potentially the birds associated with those calls. HighlightsO_LIMany prey animals change their behaviour in response to their predators calls. C_LIO_LIWhether butterflies alter behaviour in response to bird predator calls is unknown. C_LIO_LIWe show that Heliconius melpomene change behaviour in response to jacamar calls. C_LIO_LIMales increased walking and fluttering, but did not alter courting behaviour. C_LIO_LIH. melpomene did not respond to predatory Eastern kingbird or tropical kingbird calls. C_LI\nAggression: A gut reaction? The effects of gut microbiome on aggression\nAuthors: Uzan-Yulzari, A.; Turjeman, S.; Getselter, D.; Rautava, S.; Isolauri, E.; Khatib, S.; Elliott, E.; Koren, O.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564110\nRecent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science. One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.\nAcute effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of gaze fixations during visual aesthetic perception\nAuthors: Muller, S.; Cavanna, F.; de la Fuente, L. A.; Bruno, N.; D'Amelio, T.; Pallavicini, C.; Tagliazucchi, E.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564413\nRationaleSerotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce variable yet reproducible modifications to human consciousness The most salient acute effects of these compounds include perceptual alterations, predominantly in the visual domain, yet to date these alterations have been mostly documented only by subjective reports. ObjectivesWe used eye-tracking to quantify the effects of low vs. high doses of psilocybin mushrooms on the eye movements that underlie the exploration of complex visual stimuli, focusing on the particular case of aesthetic perception. ResultsFollowing a double-blind placebo-controlled design under semi-naturalistic conditions, we demonstrated that high doses of psilocybin result in a more local visual exploration of paintings, and thus in a less entropic fixation probability distribution. Participants reported heightened emotional response and state of flow under the high dose condition. ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with an effect of psilocybin on gaze fixation mediated by altered perception of low-level visual information, such as textures, shapes and colors. Our work also highlights the possibility of investigating psychedelics by addressing their effect on behavior under complex naturalistic conditions, which contributes to maintaining subject engagement while also increasing the ecological validity of the findings.\nReptiLearn: A Smart Home Cage for Behavioral Experiments in Reptiles\nAuthors: Eisenberg, T.; Shein-Idelson, M.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565252\nUnderstanding behavior and its evolutionary underpinnings is crucial for unraveling the complexities of brain function. Traditional approaches strive to reduce behavioral complexity by designing short-term, highly constrained behavioral tasks with dichotomous choices in which animals respond to defined external perturbation. In contrast, natural behaviors evolve over multiple time scales and under minimally constrained conditions in which actions are selected through bi-directional interactions with the environment and without human intervention. Recent technological advancements have opened up new possibilities for more natural experimental designs by replacing stringent experimental control with accurate multidimensional behavioral analysis. However, these approaches have been tailored to fit only a small number of species. This specificity limits the experimental opportunities offered by species diversity. Further, it hampers comparative analyses which are essential for extracting overarching behavioral principles and for examining behavior from an evolutionary perspective. To address this limitation, we developed ReptiLearn - a versatile, low-cost, Python-based solution, optimized for conducting automated long-term experiments in the home cage of reptiles, without human intervention. In addition, this system offers unique features such as precise temperature measurement and control, live prey reward dispensers, engagement with touch screens, and remote control through a user-friendly web interface. Finally, ReptiLearn incorporates low-latency closed-loop feedback allowing bi-directional interactions between animals and their environments. Thus, ReptiLearn provides a comprehensive solution for researchers studying behavior in ectotherms and beyond, bridging the gap between constrained laboratory settings and natural behavior in non-conventional model systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of ReptiLearn by automatically training the lizard Pogona vitticeps on a complex spatial learning task requiring association learning, displaced reward learning and reversal learning.\nA single bout of vigorous exercise decreases subsequent non-exercise physical activity and body temperature\nAuthors: Funabashi, D.; Dobashi, S.; Sameshima, K.; Sagayama, H.; Nishijima, T.; Matsui, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563892\nExercise benefits the body and mind, but its weight loss effect is less than generally expected. Although this phenomenon is likely due to a decrease in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and thermogenesis following exercise, the underlying mechanisms and effects of exercise intensity remain unknown. Here we show the potential role of corticosterone dynamics in the decline in NEPA and heat production following vigorous exercise. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were categorized into three groups: sedentary, moderate exercise, and vigorous exercise, with exercise groups undergoing a 30 min treadmill session. Using an intraperitoneally implanted activity monitor, NEPA and body temperature (BT) were monitored for two days before and three days after exercise. The daily synchrony between the NEPA and BT was evaluated using a cross-correlation function. Plasma corticosterone was also detected at 6 and 24 h after exercise. Notably, only the vigorous exercise group exhibited a decline in both NEPA and BT, and increased body weight compared to the sedentary group, despite no observed changes in food intake. Furthermore, a distinct negative time lag was identified between the daily dynamics of NEPA and BT following vigorous exercise. A positive correlation was observed between plasma corticosterone levels and changes in NEPA before and after exercise across all exercise groups. Our findings provide evidence for vigorous exercise-specific reduction in NEPA, BT, and their synchrony, likely due to the disturbed circadian rhythm of corticosterone. Declined BT could imply lowered thermogenesis, providing novel insights into the role of exercise intensity in influencing the weight loss effects of exercise.\nLeaderless consensus decision-making determines cooperative transport direction in weaver ants\nAuthors: Carlesso, D.; Stewardson, M.; Garnier, S.; Feinerman, O.; Reid, C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564117\nAnimal groups need to achieve and maintain consensus to minimise conflict among individuals and prevent group fragmentation. An excellent example of a consensus challenge is cooperative transport, where multiple individuals cooperate to move a large item together. This behavior, regularly displayed by ants and humans only, requires individuals to agree on which direction to move in. Unlike humans, ants cannot use verbal communication but most likely rely on private information and/or mechanical forces sensed through the carried item to coordinate their behaviour. Here we investigated how groups of weaver ants achieve consensus during cooperative transport using a tethered-object protocol, where ants had to transport a prey item that was tethered in place with a thin string. This protocol allows the decoupling of the movement of informed ants from that of uninformed individuals. We showed that weaver ants pool together the opinions of all group members to increase their navigational accuracy. We confirmed this result using a symmetry-breaking task, in which we challenged ants with navigating an open-ended corridor. Weaver ants are the first reported ant species to use a wisdom of the crowd strategy for cooperative transport, demonstrating that consensus mechanisms may differ according to the ecology of each species.\nGoing with the flow: evidence that cooperative individuals adjust their cooperative behaviour in response to the social environment in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata)\nAuthors: Dimitriadou, S.; Padget, R. F. B.; Jack, T.; Darden, S. K.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565091\nAssortative interactions can be key for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Assortment by cooperative phenotype arises from behavioural plasticity, genetic polymorphism, or a combination of both. For example, individuals can cooperate conditional on social partner behaviour, and tolerance of unfavourable behaviour may correlate with an individual's cooperative phenotype, but this has yet to be investigated outside of humans. Here, we used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to explore whether individuals that differed in their cooperativeness also differed in the plasticity of their response to changing cooperativeness in a simulated social partner. To identify when selection may favour high or low plasticity as a function of cooperativeness, we also developed an evolutionary simulation model, where individuals' probability of cooperating was modelled alongside their plasticity. Our empirical results suggest that guppies that have been bred to make high cooperative investments in the context of predator inspection exhibit higher plasticity when partners switch from defection to cooperation, compared to guppies bred to make lower cooperative investments. Our agent-based model found that more cooperative individuals will show greater plasticity in their propensity to cooperate, compared to less cooperative individuals, except when there are no consequences of nobody cooperating. Combined, our findings show that more cooperative individuals might benefit from a greater capacity to adjust behaviour than less cooperative individuals do. We suggest that this could facilitate assortment by cooperative phenotype, contributing to the evolution of this risky cooperative behaviour.\nFemale cichlids attack and avoid-but will still mate with-androgen receptor mutant males that lack male-typical body coloration\nAuthors: Howard, M.; Ramsaroop, M.; Hoadley, A.; Jackson, L.; Lopez, M.; Saenz, L.; Alward, B. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565323\nA key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b+ cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b+ cells to coordinate behavioral output.\nBehavioral Syndromes in Paper Wasps: links between social and non-social personality in Polistes fuscatus\nAuthors: Jomaa, F. W.; Laub, E.; Tibbetts, E. A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564788\nAlthough much work has focused on non-social personality traits such as activity, exploration, and neophobia, there is a growing appreciation that social personality traits play an important role in group dynamics, disease transmission, and fitness, and that social personality traits may be linked to non-social personality traits. These relationships are important because behavioral syndromes, defined here as correlated behavioral phenotypes, can constrain evolutionary responses. However, the strength and direction of relationships between social and non-social personality traits remain unclear. In this project, we examine social and non-social personality traits, and the relationships between them, in the paper wasp Polistes fuscatus. With a novel assay we identify five personality traits, two non-social (exploration and activity) and three social (aggression, affiliation, and antennation) personality traits. We also find that social and non-social personality traits are phenotypically linked. We find a positive correlation between aggression and activity (rs = 0.33) and a negative correlation between affiliation and activity (rs = -0.35). We also find a positive correlation between exploration and activity. Our work is an important step in understanding how phenotypic linkage between social and non-social behaviors may influence behavioral evolution. As a burgeoning model system for the study of genetic and neurobiological mechanisms of social behavior, Polistes fuscatus has potential to add to this work through exploring the causes and consequences of individual behavioral variation.\nRNA activities of trans species: RNA from the sperm of the father of an autistic child programs glial cells and behavioral disorders in mice.\nAuthors: Yilmaz Sukranli, Z.; Korkmaz Bayram, K.; Mehmetbeyoglu, E.; Doganyigit, Z.; Beyaz, F.; Sener, E.

Studies in model organisms suggest that noncoding RNAs participate in transcriptional modulation pathways. Using mice, approaches to alter the amount of RNA in fertilized eggs enable in vivo intervention at an early stage of development. Noncoding RNAs are very numerous in spermatozoa. Our study aims to address a fundamental question: Can the transfer of RNA content from sperm to eggs result in changes in phenotypic traits, such as autism? To explore this, we utilized RNA from the sperm of a father with autistic children and microinjected it into fertilized mouse eggs, thus creating mouse models for autism. Here, we induced in a single step by microinjection of sperm RNA into fertilized eggs the transformation of glial cells into cells capable of developing `autism-like` disorders in mice born from these alterations.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Prey-predator interactions have resulted in the evolution of many anti-predatory traits. One of them is the ability for prey to listen to predators and avoid them. Although prey anti-predatory behavioural responses to predator auditory cues are well described in a wide range of taxa, studies on whether butterflies change their behaviours in response to their predatory calls are lacking. Heliconius butterflies are unpalatable and form Mullerian mimicry rings as morphological defence strategies against their bird predators. Like many other butterflies in the Nymphalidae family, Heliconius butterflies possess auditory organs, which are hypothesized to have evolved to assist with predator detection. Here we test whether Heliconius melpomene change their behaviour in response to their predatory bird calls by observing the behaviour of male and female H. m. plessini exposed to calls of Heliconius avian predators: rufous-tailed jacamar, migratory Eastern kingbird, and resident tropical kingbird. We also exposed them to the calls of the toco toucan, a frugivorous bird as a control bird call, and an amplified greenhouse background noise as a noise control. We found that individuals changed their behaviour in response to jacamar calls only. Males increased their walking and fluttering behaviour, while females did not change their behaviour during the playback of the jacamar call. Intersexual behaviours like courtship, copulation, and abdomen lifting did not change in response to bird calls. Our findings suggest that despite having primary predatory defences like toxicity and being in a mimicry ring, H. m. plessini butterflies changed their behaviour in response to predator calls. Furthermore, this response was predator specific, as H. m. plesseni did not respond to either the Eastern kingbird or the tropic kingbird calls. This suggests that Heliconius butterflies may be able to differentiate predatory calls, and potentially the birds associated with those calls.

        <p class="abstract">Recent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.

One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleSerotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce variable yet reproducible modifications to human consciousness The most salient acute effects of these compounds include perceptual alterations, predominantly in the visual domain, yet to date these alterations have been mostly documented only by subjective reports.

ObjectivesWe used eye-tracking to quantify the effects of low vs. high doses of psilocybin mushrooms on the eye movements that underlie the exploration of complex visual stimuli, focusing on the particular case of aesthetic perception.

ResultsFollowing a double-blind placebo-controlled design under semi-naturalistic conditions, we demonstrated that high doses of psilocybin result in a more local visual exploration of paintings, and thus in a less entropic fixation probability distribution. Participants reported heightened emotional response and state of flow under the high dose condition.

ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with an effect of psilocybin on gaze fixation mediated by altered perception of low-level visual information, such as textures, shapes and colors. Our work also highlights the possibility of investigating psychedelics by addressing their effect on behavior under complex naturalistic conditions, which contributes to maintaining subject engagement while also increasing the ecological validity of the findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding behavior and its evolutionary underpinnings is crucial for unraveling the complexities of brain function. Traditional approaches strive to reduce behavioral complexity by designing short-term, highly constrained behavioral tasks with dichotomous choices in which animals respond to defined external perturbation. In contrast, natural behaviors evolve over multiple time scales and under minimally constrained conditions in which actions are selected through bi-directional interactions with the environment and without human intervention. Recent technological advancements have opened up new possibilities for more natural experimental designs by replacing stringent experimental control with accurate multidimensional behavioral analysis. However, these approaches have been tailored to fit only a small number of species. This specificity limits the experimental opportunities offered by species diversity. Further, it hampers comparative analyses which are essential for extracting overarching behavioral principles and for examining behavior from an evolutionary perspective. To address this limitation, we developed ReptiLearn - a versatile, low-cost, Python-based solution, optimized for conducting automated long-term experiments in the home cage of reptiles, without human intervention. In addition, this system offers unique features such as precise temperature measurement and control, live prey reward dispensers, engagement with touch screens, and remote control through a user-friendly web interface. Finally, ReptiLearn incorporates low-latency closed-loop feedback allowing bi-directional interactions between animals and their environments. Thus, ReptiLearn provides a comprehensive solution for researchers studying behavior in ectotherms and beyond, bridging the gap between constrained laboratory settings and natural behavior in non-conventional model systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of ReptiLearn by automatically training the lizard Pogona vitticeps on a complex spatial learning task requiring association learning, displaced reward learning and reversal learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise benefits the body and mind, but its weight loss effect is less than generally expected. Although this phenomenon is likely due to a decrease in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and thermogenesis following exercise, the underlying mechanisms and effects of exercise intensity remain unknown. Here we show the potential role of corticosterone dynamics in the decline in NEPA and heat production following vigorous exercise. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were categorized into three groups: sedentary, moderate exercise, and vigorous exercise, with exercise groups undergoing a 30 min treadmill session. Using an intraperitoneally implanted activity monitor, NEPA and body temperature (BT) were monitored for two days before and three days after exercise. The daily synchrony between the NEPA and BT was evaluated using a cross-correlation function. Plasma corticosterone was also detected at 6 and 24 h after exercise. Notably, only the vigorous exercise group exhibited a decline in both NEPA and BT, and increased body weight compared to the sedentary group, despite no observed changes in food intake. Furthermore, a distinct negative time lag was identified between the daily dynamics of NEPA and BT following vigorous exercise. A positive correlation was observed between plasma corticosterone levels and changes in NEPA before and after exercise across all exercise groups. Our findings provide evidence for vigorous exercise-specific reduction in NEPA, BT, and their synchrony, likely due to the disturbed circadian rhythm of corticosterone. Declined BT could imply lowered thermogenesis, providing novel insights into the role of exercise intensity in influencing the weight loss effects of exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal groups need to achieve and maintain consensus to minimise conflict among individuals and prevent group fragmentation. An excellent example of a consensus challenge is cooperative transport, where multiple individuals cooperate to move a large item together. This behavior, regularly displayed by ants and humans only, requires individuals to agree on which direction to move in. Unlike humans, ants cannot use verbal communication but most likely rely on private information and/or mechanical forces sensed through the carried item to coordinate their behaviour. Here we investigated how groups of weaver ants achieve consensus during cooperative transport using a tethered-object protocol, where ants had to transport a prey item that was tethered in place with a thin string. This protocol allows the decoupling of the movement of informed ants from that of uninformed individuals. We showed that weaver ants pool together the opinions of all group members to increase their navigational accuracy. We confirmed this result using a symmetry-breaking task, in which we challenged ants with navigating an open-ended corridor. Weaver ants are the first reported ant species to use a wisdom of the crowd strategy for cooperative transport, demonstrating that consensus mechanisms may differ according to the ecology of each species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assortative interactions can be key for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Assortment by cooperative phenotype arises from behavioural plasticity, genetic polymorphism, or a combination of both. For example, individuals can cooperate conditional on social partner behaviour, and tolerance of unfavourable behaviour may correlate with an individual&#39;s cooperative phenotype, but this has yet to be investigated outside of humans. Here, we used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to explore whether individuals that differed in their cooperativeness also differed in the plasticity of their response to changing cooperativeness in a simulated social partner. To identify when selection may favour high or low plasticity as a function of cooperativeness, we also developed an evolutionary simulation model, where individuals&#39; probability of cooperating was modelled alongside their plasticity. Our empirical results suggest that guppies that have been bred to make high cooperative investments in the context of predator inspection exhibit higher plasticity when partners switch from defection to cooperation, compared to guppies bred to make lower cooperative investments. Our agent-based model found that more cooperative individuals will show greater plasticity in their propensity to cooperate, compared to less cooperative individuals, except when there are no consequences of nobody cooperating. Combined, our findings show that more cooperative individuals might benefit from a greater capacity to adjust behaviour than less cooperative individuals do. We suggest that this could facilitate assortment by cooperative phenotype, contributing to the evolution of this risky cooperative behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b&#43; cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b&#43; cells to coordinate behavioral output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Although much work has focused on non-social personality traits such as activity, exploration, and neophobia, there is a growing appreciation that social personality traits play an important role in group dynamics, disease transmission, and fitness, and that social personality traits may be linked to non-social personality traits. These relationships are important because behavioral syndromes, defined here as correlated behavioral phenotypes, can constrain evolutionary responses. However, the strength and direction of relationships between social and non-social personality traits remain unclear. In this project, we examine social and non-social personality traits, and the relationships between them, in the paper wasp Polistes fuscatus. With a novel assay we identify five personality traits, two non-social (exploration and activity) and three social (aggression, affiliation, and antennation) personality traits. We also find that social and non-social personality traits are phenotypically linked. We find a positive correlation between aggression and activity (rs = 0.33) and a negative correlation between affiliation and activity (rs = -0.35). We also find a positive correlation between exploration and activity. Our work is an important step in understanding how phenotypic linkage between social and non-social behaviors may influence behavioral evolution. As a burgeoning model system for the study of genetic and neurobiological mechanisms of social behavior, Polistes fuscatus has potential to add to this work through exploring the causes and consequences of individual behavioral variation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recently, we described the alteration of six miRNAs in the serum of autistic children, their fathers, mothers, siblings and in the sperm of autistic mouse models. Studies in model organisms suggest that noncoding RNAs participate in transcriptional modulation pathways. Using mice, approaches to alter the amount of RNA in fertilized eggs enable in vivo intervention at an early stage of development. Noncoding RNAs are very numerous in spermatozoa. Our study aims to address a fundamental question: Can the transfer of RNA content from sperm to eggs result in changes in phenotypic traits, such as autism? To explore this, we utilized RNA from the sperm of a father with autistic children and microinjected it into fertilized mouse eggs, thus creating mouse models for autism. Here, we induced in a single step by microinjection of sperm RNA into fertilized eggs the transformation of glial cells into cells capable of developing `autism-like` disorders in mice born from these alterations.</p>
