Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.\nBehavioral and Neural Resilience to Isolation in a Eusocial Insect\nAuthors: Goolsby, B.

Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.\nEndocannabinoid system modulation alters fine motor behavior in mice: insights from 3D motion capture\nAuthors: Ignatowska-Jankowska, B. M.; Gurkan Ozer, A.; Kuck, A.; Niphakis, M. J.; Ogasawara, D.; Cravatt, B. F.; Uusisaari, M. Y.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546437\nThe neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.\nHiding in the bush, in fear of a predator! Vegetation and predators influence shoaling among wild zebrafish\nAuthors: Mukherjee, I.; Bhat, A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547402\nSocial responses of aquatic group-living organisms are critically dependent on predation risk and vegetation cover in their habitat. To gain insight into how these factors shape their immediate responses, we exposed wild zebrafish shoals to either vegetation, predator cues or both these factors simultaneously. Control treatments were not exposed to the above factors. By analyzing 60 unique shoals across 270 experimental trials, we found that while shoals formed significantly larger subgroups and were significantly more polarized in the presence of predator cues, both these properties decreased when shoals experienced predator cues in presence of vegetation. Furthermore, foraging was significantly lower when predator cues and/or vegetation were present. Tracking of all individuals in treatments devoid of vegetation revealed that: (i) compared to control treatments, individuals within shoals receiving predator cues had a significantly higher probability to continue being in a group and (ii) individuals occupying the front positions deviated lesser from their median position within a shoal as compared to other individuals. Anti-predator responses and foraging are critical for survival and therefore, this study provides important insights into shoal dynamics in changing environments.\nTimed sequence task: a new paradigm to study motor learning and flexibility in mice\nAuthors: Urushadze, A.; Janicek, M.; Abbondanza, A.; Janickova, H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547172\nMotor learning and flexibility allow animals to perform routine actions efficiently while keeping them flexible. There is a number of paradigms used to test cognitive flexibility but not many of them focus specifically on learning of complex motor sequences and their flexibility. While many tests use operant or touchscreen boxes that offer high throughput and reproducibility, the motor actions themselves are mostly simple presses of a designated lever. To focus more on motor actions during the operant task and to probe the flexibility of these well-trained actions, we developed a new operant paradigm for mice, the \"timed sequence task\". The task requires mice to learn a sequence of lever presses that have to be emitted in precisely defined time limits. After training, the required pressing sequence and/or timing of individual presses is modified to test the ability of mice to alter their previously trained motor actions. We provide a code for the new protocol that can be used and adapted to common types of operant boxes. In addition, we provide a set of scripts that allow automatic extraction and analysis of numerous parameters recorded during each session. We demonstrate that the analysis of multiple performance parameters is necessary for detailed insight into animals behavior during the task. We validate our paradigm in an experiment using the valproate model of autism as a model of cognitive inflexibility. We show that the valproate mice show superior performance at specific stages of the task, paradoxically due to their propensity to more stereotypic behavior. Significance StatementCognitive flexibility impairment is a crucial component of many neurological disorders and it is frequently evaluated in animal models. As the commonly used tests usually do not focus on motor learning and the ability to adapt motor sequences, we designed a new paradigm to evaluate motor learning and its flexibility. The timed sequence task is automatized and easily accessible as it is based on widely available operant boxes. During the training, the task requires precise timing of each action to force stereotypic performance. Its relative complexity allows detailed analysis of multiple parameters and therefore detailed insight into animals behavior. The task can be used to reveal and understand subtle differences in motor and operant learning and flexibility.

A.; Cecchetti, G.; Ericson, P.; Cano, E.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546175\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear. In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages. Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.\nDissociable encoding of motivated behavior by parallel thalamo-striatal projections\nAuthors: Beas, S.; Khan, I.; Gao, C.; MacDonnolad, E.; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, S.; Penzo, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548113\nThe successful pursuit of goals requires the coordinated execution and termination of actions that lead to positive outcomes. This process is thought to rely on motivational states that are guided by internal drivers, such as hunger or fear. However, the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions are not fully understood. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a midline thalamic nucleus that shapes motivated behaviors via its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (1-9) and monitors internal state via interoceptive inputs from the hypothalamus and brainstem (10-14). Recent studies have revealed two major PVT neuronal subpopulations, Type1PVT and Type2PVT, which differ in genetic identity, functionality, and anatomical connectivity to other brain regions, including the NAc (15-17). In this study, we used fiber photometry to investigate the in vivo dynamics of these two distinct PVT neuronal types in mice performing a reward foraging task. We discovered that Type1PVT and Type2PVT neurons encode the execution and termination of goal-oriented actions, respectively. Furthermore, unlike Type2PVT cells, activity in the Type1PVT neuronal population mirrored motivation parameters such as vigor and satiety. Interestingly, these features were largely preserved when activity in PVT projections to the NAc was selectively assessed. Collectively, our results highlight the existence of two parallel thalamo-striatal projections that participate in the dynamic regulation of goal pursuits and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions.\nEfficient numerosity estimation under limited time\nAuthors: Heng, J. A.; Woodford, M.; Polania, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547493\nThe ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. Despite its importance, the rapid representation and estimation of numerosity is surprisingly imprecise and biased. However, a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.\nEnvironmental enrichment promotes adaptive responding during tests of behavioral regulation in male heterogeneous stock rats\nAuthors: Ishiwari, K.; King, C.

H.; Meyer, P. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547228\nOrganisms must regulate their behavior flexibly in the face of environmental challenges. Failure can lead to a host of maladaptive behavioral traits associated with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and substance use disorders. This maladaptive dysregulation of behavior is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. For example, environmental enrichment produces beneficial neurobehavioral effects in animal models of such disorders. The present study determined the effects of environmental enrichment on a range of measures related to behavioral regulation using a large cohort of male, outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as subjects to mimic the genetic variability found in the human population. Subjects were reared from late adolescence onwards either in pairs in standard housing with minimal enrichment (n=200) or in groups of 16 in a highly enriched environment consisting of a large multi-level cage filled with toys, running wheels, and shelters (n=64). Rats were subjected to a battery of tests, including: (i) locomotor response to novelty, (iI) light reinforcement, (iii) social reinforcement, (iv) reaction time, (v) a patch-depletion foraging test, (vi) Pavlovian conditioned approach, (vii) conditioned reinforcement, and (viii) cocaine conditioned cue preference. Results indicated that rats housed in the enriched environment were able to filter out irrelevant stimuli more effectively and thereby regulate their behavior more efficiently than standard-housing rats. The dramatic impact of environmental enrichment suggests that behavioral studies using standard housing conditions may not generalize to more complex environments that may be more ethologically relevant.\nDynamic skin signatures of cuttlefish internal states\nAuthors: Cohen Bodenes, S.; Neri, P.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-06-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.19.545578\nCuttlefish skin is a powerful rendering device, capable of producing extraordinary changes in visual appearance over a broad range of temporal scales. This unique ability is typically associated with camouflage, however cuttlefish often produce skin patterns that do not appear connected with the surrounding environment, such as fast large-scale fluctuations with wave-like characteristics. Little is known about the functional significance of these dynamic patterns. In this study, we manipulate the internal state of cuttlefish without altering their sensory environments, and study potential changes in the associated pattern dynamics. When cuttlefish are engaged in feeding, we observe accentuated dynamics of specific pattern components within the theta frequency range, with additional evidence of increased display for other components. These changes disappear during the post-feeding phase, which resembles the pre-feeding phase, indicating that they last for a relatively short time between 10 and 20 minutes. Our findings therefore reveal specific alterations of skin pattern dynamics that correspond to changes of internal state associated with self-driven non-sensory behavior.\n",

        <p class="abstract">We present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.</p>

Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social responses of aquatic group-living organisms are critically dependent on predation risk and vegetation cover in their habitat. To gain insight into how these factors shape their immediate responses, we exposed wild zebrafish shoals to either vegetation, predator cues or both these factors simultaneously. Control treatments were not exposed to the above factors. By analyzing 60 unique shoals across 270 experimental trials, we found that while shoals formed significantly larger subgroups and were significantly more polarized in the presence of predator cues, both these properties decreased when shoals experienced predator cues in presence of vegetation. Furthermore, foraging was significantly lower when predator cues and/or vegetation were present. Tracking of all individuals in treatments devoid of vegetation revealed that: (i) compared to control treatments, individuals within shoals receiving predator cues had a significantly higher probability to continue being in a group and (ii) individuals occupying the front positions deviated lesser from their median position within a shoal as compared to other individuals. Anti-predator responses and foraging are critical for survival and therefore, this study provides important insights into shoal dynamics in changing environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motor learning and flexibility allow animals to perform routine actions efficiently while keeping them flexible. There is a number of paradigms used to test cognitive flexibility but not many of them focus specifically on learning of complex motor sequences and their flexibility. While many tests use operant or touchscreen boxes that offer high throughput and reproducibility, the motor actions themselves are mostly simple presses of a designated lever. To focus more on motor actions during the operant task and to probe the flexibility of these well-trained actions, we developed a new operant paradigm for mice, the &#34;timed sequence task&#34;. The task requires mice to learn a sequence of lever presses that have to be emitted in precisely defined time limits. After training, the required pressing sequence and/or timing of individual presses is modified to test the ability of mice to alter their previously trained motor actions. We provide a code for the new protocol that can be used and adapted to common types of operant boxes. In addition, we provide a set of scripts that allow automatic extraction and analysis of numerous parameters recorded during each session. We demonstrate that the analysis of multiple performance parameters is necessary for detailed insight into animals behavior during the task. We validate our paradigm in an experiment using the valproate model of autism as a model of cognitive inflexibility. We show that the valproate mice show superior performance at specific stages of the task, paradoxically due to their propensity to more stereotypic behavior.

Significance StatementCognitive flexibility impairment is a crucial component of many neurological disorders and it is frequently evaluated in animal models. As the commonly used tests usually do not focus on motor learning and the ability to adapt motor sequences, we designed a new paradigm to evaluate motor learning and its flexibility. The timed sequence task is automatized and easily accessible as it is based on widely available operant boxes. During the training, the task requires precise timing of each action to force stereotypic performance. Its relative complexity allows detailed analysis of multiple parameters and therefore detailed insight into animals behavior. The task can be used to reveal and understand subtle differences in motor and operant learning and flexibility.

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music  to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear.

In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages.

Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The successful pursuit of goals requires the coordinated execution and termination of actions that lead to positive outcomes. This process is thought to rely on motivational states that are guided by internal drivers, such as hunger or fear. However, the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions are not fully understood. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a midline thalamic nucleus that shapes motivated behaviors via its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (1-9) and monitors internal state via interoceptive inputs from the hypothalamus and brainstem (10-14). Recent studies have revealed two major PVT neuronal subpopulations, Type1PVT and Type2PVT, which differ in genetic identity, functionality, and anatomical connectivity to other brain regions, including the NAc (15-17). In this study, we used fiber photometry to investigate the in vivo dynamics of these two distinct PVT neuronal types in mice performing a reward foraging task. We discovered that Type1PVT and Type2PVT neurons encode the execution and termination of goal-oriented actions, respectively. Furthermore, unlike Type2PVT cells, activity in the Type1PVT neuronal population mirrored motivation parameters such as vigor and satiety. Interestingly, these features were largely preserved when activity in PVT projections to the NAc was selectively assessed. Collectively, our results highlight the existence of two parallel thalamo-striatal projections that participate in the dynamic regulation of goal pursuits and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. Despite its importance, the rapid representation and estimation of numerosity is surprisingly imprecise and biased. However, a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms must regulate their behavior flexibly in the face of environmental challenges. Failure can lead to a host of maladaptive behavioral traits associated with a range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and substance use disorders. This maladaptive dysregulation of behavior is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. For example, environmental enrichment produces beneficial neurobehavioral effects in animal models of such disorders. The present study determined the effects of environmental enrichment on a range of measures related to behavioral regulation using a large cohort of male, outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as subjects to mimic the genetic variability found in the human population. Subjects were reared from late adolescence onwards either in pairs in standard housing with minimal enrichment (n=200) or in groups of 16 in a highly enriched environment consisting of a large multi-level cage filled with toys, running wheels, and shelters (n=64). Rats were subjected to a battery of tests, including: (i) locomotor response to novelty, (iI) light reinforcement, (iii) social reinforcement, (iv) reaction time, (v) a patch-depletion foraging test, (vi) Pavlovian conditioned approach, (vii) conditioned reinforcement, and (viii) cocaine conditioned cue preference. Results indicated that rats housed in the enriched environment were able to filter out irrelevant stimuli more effectively and thereby regulate their behavior more efficiently than standard-housing rats. The dramatic impact of environmental enrichment suggests that behavioral studies using standard housing conditions may not generalize to more complex environments that may be more ethologically relevant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cuttlefish skin is a powerful rendering device, capable of producing extraordinary changes in visual appearance over a broad range of temporal scales. This unique ability is typically associated with camouflage, however cuttlefish often produce skin patterns that do not appear connected with the surrounding environment, such as fast large-scale fluctuations with wave-like characteristics. Little is known about the functional significance of these dynamic patterns. In this study, we manipulate the internal state of cuttlefish without altering their sensory environments, and study potential changes in the associated pattern dynamics. When cuttlefish are engaged in feeding, we observe accentuated dynamics of specific pattern components within the theta frequency range, with additional evidence of increased display for other components. These changes disappear during the post-feeding phase, which resembles the pre-feeding phase, indicating that they last for a relatively short time between 10 and 20 minutes. Our findings therefore reveal specific alterations of skin pattern dynamics that correspond to changes of internal state associated with self-driven non-sensory behavior.</p>
