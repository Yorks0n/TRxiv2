  "articleBody": " Plant-like heliotropism in a photosymbiotic animal\nAuthors: Lintnerova, E.; Shaw, C.; Keys, M.; Brownlee, C.; Modepalli, V.\nScore: 16.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565328\nBeing photosynthetic sessile organisms, plants established heliotropism to track the sun's position across the sky and allow their vegetative parts to orient accordingly. Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the sun's relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.\nFemale cichlids attack and avoid-but will still mate with-androgen receptor mutant males that lack male-typical body coloration\nAuthors: Howard, M.; Ramsaroop, M.; Hoadley, A.; Jackson, L.; Lopez, M.; Saenz, L.; Alward, B. A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565323\nA key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b+ cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b+ cells to coordinate behavioral output.\nAcute effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of gaze fixations during visual aesthetic perception\nAuthors: Muller, S.; Cavanna, F.; de la Fuente, L. A.; Bruno, N.; D'Amelio, T.; Pallavicini, C.; Tagliazucchi, E.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564413\nRationaleSerotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce variable yet reproducible modifications to human consciousness The most salient acute effects of these compounds include perceptual alterations, predominantly in the visual domain, yet to date these alterations have been mostly documented only by subjective reports. ObjectivesWe used eye-tracking to quantify the effects of low vs. high doses of psilocybin mushrooms on the eye movements that underlie the exploration of complex visual stimuli, focusing on the particular case of aesthetic perception. ResultsFollowing a double-blind placebo-controlled design under semi-naturalistic conditions, we demonstrated that high doses of psilocybin result in a more local visual exploration of paintings, and thus in a less entropic fixation probability distribution. Participants reported heightened emotional response and state of flow under the high dose condition. ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with an effect of psilocybin on gaze fixation mediated by altered perception of low-level visual information, such as textures, shapes and colors. Our work also highlights the possibility of investigating psychedelics by addressing their effect on behavior under complex naturalistic conditions, which contributes to maintaining subject engagement while also increasing the ecological validity of the findings.\nAggression: A gut reaction? The effects of gut microbiome on aggression\nAuthors: Uzan-Yulzari, A.; Turjeman, S.; Getselter, D.; Rautava, S.; Isolauri, E.; Khatib, S.; Elliott, E.; Koren, O.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564110\nRecent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science. One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.\nReptiLearn: A Smart Home Cage for Behavioral Experiments in Reptiles\nAuthors: Eisenberg, T.; Shein-Idelson, M.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565252\nUnderstanding behavior and its evolutionary underpinnings is crucial for unraveling the complexities of brain function. Traditional approaches strive to reduce behavioral complexity by designing short-term, highly constrained behavioral tasks with dichotomous choices in which animals respond to defined external perturbation. In contrast, natural behaviors evolve over multiple time scales and under minimally constrained conditions in which actions are selected through bi-directional interactions with the environment and without human intervention. Recent technological advancements have opened up new possibilities for more natural experimental designs by replacing stringent experimental control with accurate multidimensional behavioral analysis. However, these approaches have been tailored to fit only a small number of species. This specificity limits the experimental opportunities offered by species diversity. Further, it hampers comparative analyses which are essential for extracting overarching behavioral principles and for examining behavior from an evolutionary perspective. To address this limitation, we developed ReptiLearn - a versatile, low-cost, Python-based solution, optimized for conducting automated long-term experiments in the home cage of reptiles, without human intervention. In addition, this system offers unique features such as precise temperature measurement and control, live prey reward dispensers, engagement with touch screens, and remote control through a user-friendly web interface. Finally, ReptiLearn incorporates low-latency closed-loop feedback allowing bi-directional interactions between animals and their environments. Thus, ReptiLearn provides a comprehensive solution for researchers studying behavior in ectotherms and beyond, bridging the gap between constrained laboratory settings and natural behavior in non-conventional model systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of ReptiLearn by automatically training the lizard Pogona vitticeps on a complex spatial learning task requiring association learning, displaced reward learning and reversal learning.\nKnowledge by omission: the significance of omissions in the 5-choice serial reaction time task\nAuthors: Vouillac, C.; Durand, A.; Ahmed, S. H.; Guillem, K.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565747\nThe 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.\nAging in zebrafish is associated with reduced locomotor activity and strain-dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety.\nAuthors: Hudock, J.; Kenney, J. W.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565457\nAging is associated with a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes in many species. Like humans, zebrafish exhibit gradual senescence, and thus may be a useful model organism for identifying evolutionarily conserved mechanisms related to aging. Here, we compared behavior in the novel tank test of young (6-month-old) and middle aged (12-month-old) zebrafish from two strains (TL and TU) and both sexes. We find that this modest age difference results in a reduction in locomotor activity and strain dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety. Older TL fish have an elevation in bottom dwelling whereas older TU fish have a decrease in thigmotaxis. We found no consistent effects of age on either short-term (within session) or long-term (1 day later) habituation to the novel tank. Our findings support the use of zebrafish for the study of how age affects locomotion and how genetics interacts with age to alter the regulation of emotional behaviors in response to novelty.\nLeaderless consensus decision-making determines cooperative transport direction in weaver ants\nAuthors: Carlesso, D.; Stewardson, M.; Garnier, S.; Feinerman, O.; Reid, C.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564117\nAnimal groups need to achieve and maintain consensus to minimise conflict among individuals and prevent group fragmentation. An excellent example of a consensus challenge is cooperative transport, where multiple individuals cooperate to move a large item together. This behavior, regularly displayed by ants and humans only, requires individuals to agree on which direction to move in. Unlike humans, ants cannot use verbal communication but most likely rely on private information and/or mechanical forces sensed through the carried item to coordinate their behaviour. Here we investigated how groups of weaver ants achieve consensus during cooperative transport using a tethered-object protocol, where ants had to transport a prey item that was tethered in place with a thin string. This protocol allows the decoupling of the movement of informed ants from that of uninformed individuals. We showed that weaver ants pool together the opinions of all group members to increase their navigational accuracy. We confirmed this result using a symmetry-breaking task, in which we challenged ants with navigating an open-ended corridor. Weaver ants are the first reported ant species to use a wisdom of the crowd strategy for cooperative transport, demonstrating that consensus mechanisms may differ according to the ecology of each species.\nGoing with the flow: evidence that cooperative individuals adjust their cooperative behaviour in response to the social environment in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata)\nAuthors: Dimitriadou, S.; Padget, R. F. B.; Jack, T.; Darden, S. K.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565091\nAssortative interactions can be key for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Assortment by cooperative phenotype arises from behavioural plasticity, genetic polymorphism, or a combination of both. For example, individuals can cooperate conditional on social partner behaviour, and tolerance of unfavourable behaviour may correlate with an individuals cooperative phenotype, but this has yet to be investigated outside of humans. Here, we used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to explore whether individuals that differed in their cooperativeness also differed in the plasticity of their response to changing cooperativeness in a simulated social partner. To identify when selection may favour high or low plasticity as a function of cooperativeness, we also developed an evolutionary simulation model, where individuals probability of cooperating was modelled alongside their plasticity. Our empirical results suggest that guppies that have been bred to make high cooperative investments in the context of predator inspection exhibit higher plasticity when partners switch from defection to cooperation, compared to guppies bred to make lower cooperative investments. Our agent-based model found that more cooperative individuals will show greater plasticity in their propensity to cooperate, compared to less cooperative individuals, except when there are no consequences of nobody cooperating. Combined, our findings show that more cooperative individuals might benefit from a greater capacity to adjust behaviour than less cooperative individuals do. We suggest that this could facilitate assortment by cooperative phenotype, contributing to the evolution of this risky cooperative behaviour.\nThe Effects of Flow Speeds on Smooth Pursuit Tracking and Active Sensing Movements of Weakly Electric Fish\nAuthors: AYDIN, E. Y.; Unlutabak, B.; Uyanik, I.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565374\nWeakly electric fish employ refuge-tracking behavior to survive, seeking and utilizing hiding places to shield themselves from predators and unfavorable environmental conditions. This adaptive mechanism enables them to minimize the risk of predation, maintain optimal electrocommunication, and adapt to changing surroundings. While studies have explored smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements of these fish in stationary environments, limited emphasis has been given to how varying flow speeds in their natural habitats may impact these behaviors. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of different flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements in weakly electric fish. Active sensing provides sensory data and multisensory integration processes and combines this data to create a holistic perception of the environment. The synergy between these processes is fundamental for enhancing an organism's sensory capabilities and enabling it to adapt and interact effectively with its surroundings. For this study, a specialized experimental setup was designed and built to facilitate refuge-tracking behavior under controlled flow conditions. The experiments involved Apteronotus albifrons fish exposed to visual and complex electrosensory stimuli, which consisted of a sum of sine signals. Data was recorded for different sensory conditions, including variations in flow speeds, illumination levels, and refuge structures. The analysis revealed that increased flow speeds correlated with reduced tracking gain and phase lag in the fish. Additionally, it was observed that active sensing movements were more pronounced in dark conditions. These findings highlight the significant impact of flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements and emphasize the importance of studying these behaviors within the context of water flow. Understanding the biological motivations underlying these effects is vital for their potential application in engineering fields.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Being photosynthetic sessile organisms, plants established heliotropism to track the sun&#39;s position across the sky and allow their vegetative parts to orient accordingly. Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the sun&#39;s relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b&#43; cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b&#43; cells to coordinate behavioral output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">RationaleSerotonergic psychedelics are remarkable for their capacity to induce variable yet reproducible modifications to human consciousness The most salient acute effects of these compounds include perceptual alterations, predominantly in the visual domain, yet to date these alterations have been mostly documented only by subjective reports.

ObjectivesWe used eye-tracking to quantify the effects of low vs. high doses of psilocybin mushrooms on the eye movements that underlie the exploration of complex visual stimuli, focusing on the particular case of aesthetic perception.

ResultsFollowing a double-blind placebo-controlled design under semi-naturalistic conditions, we demonstrated that high doses of psilocybin result in a more local visual exploration of paintings, and thus in a less entropic fixation probability distribution. Participants reported heightened emotional response and state of flow under the high dose condition.

ConclusionsThese findings are consistent with an effect of psilocybin on gaze fixation mediated by altered perception of low-level visual information, such as textures, shapes and colors. Our work also highlights the possibility of investigating psychedelics by addressing their effect on behavior under complex naturalistic conditions, which contributes to maintaining subject engagement while also increasing the ecological validity of the findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.

One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding behavior and its evolutionary underpinnings is crucial for unraveling the complexities of brain function. Traditional approaches strive to reduce behavioral complexity by designing short-term, highly constrained behavioral tasks with dichotomous choices in which animals respond to defined external perturbation. In contrast, natural behaviors evolve over multiple time scales and under minimally constrained conditions in which actions are selected through bi-directional interactions with the environment and without human intervention. Recent technological advancements have opened up new possibilities for more natural experimental designs by replacing stringent experimental control with accurate multidimensional behavioral analysis. However, these approaches have been tailored to fit only a small number of species. This specificity limits the experimental opportunities offered by species diversity. Further, it hampers comparative analyses which are essential for extracting overarching behavioral principles and for examining behavior from an evolutionary perspective. To address this limitation, we developed ReptiLearn - a versatile, low-cost, Python-based solution, optimized for conducting automated long-term experiments in the home cage of reptiles, without human intervention. In addition, this system offers unique features such as precise temperature measurement and control, live prey reward dispensers, engagement with touch screens, and remote control through a user-friendly web interface. Finally, ReptiLearn incorporates low-latency closed-loop feedback allowing bi-directional interactions between animals and their environments. Thus, ReptiLearn provides a comprehensive solution for researchers studying behavior in ectotherms and beyond, bridging the gap between constrained laboratory settings and natural behavior in non-conventional model systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of ReptiLearn by automatically training the lizard Pogona vitticeps on a complex spatial learning task requiring association learning, displaced reward learning and reversal learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is associated with a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes in many species. Like humans, zebrafish exhibit gradual senescence, and thus may be a useful model organism for identifying evolutionarily conserved mechanisms related to aging. Here, we compared behavior in the novel tank test of young (6-month-old) and middle aged (12-month-old) zebrafish from two strains (TL and TU) and both sexes. We find that this modest age difference results in a reduction in locomotor activity and strain dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety. Older TL fish have an elevation in bottom dwelling whereas older TU fish have a decrease in thigmotaxis. We found no consistent effects of age on either short-term (within session) or long-term (1 day later) habituation to the novel tank. Our findings support the use of zebrafish for the study of how age affects locomotion and how genetics interacts with age to alter the regulation of emotional behaviors in response to novelty.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal groups need to achieve and maintain consensus to minimise conflict among individuals and prevent group fragmentation. An excellent example of a consensus challenge is cooperative transport, where multiple individuals cooperate to move a large item together. This behavior, regularly displayed by ants and humans only, requires individuals to agree on which direction to move in. Unlike humans, ants cannot use verbal communication but most likely rely on private information and/or mechanical forces sensed through the carried item to coordinate their behaviour. Here we investigated how groups of weaver ants achieve consensus during cooperative transport using a tethered-object protocol, where ants had to transport a prey item that was tethered in place with a thin string. This protocol allows the decoupling of the movement of informed ants from that of uninformed individuals. We showed that weaver ants pool together the opinions of all group members to increase their navigational accuracy. We confirmed this result using a symmetry-breaking task, in which we challenged ants with navigating an open-ended corridor. Weaver ants are the first reported ant species to use a  wisdom of the crowd strategy for cooperative transport, demonstrating that consensus mechanisms may differ according to the ecology of each species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Assortative interactions can be key for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Assortment by cooperative phenotype arises from behavioural plasticity, genetic polymorphism, or a combination of both. For example, individuals can cooperate conditional on social partner behaviour, and tolerance of unfavourable behaviour may correlate with an individuals cooperative phenotype, but this has yet to be investigated outside of humans. Here, we used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) to explore whether individuals that differed in their cooperativeness also differed in the plasticity of their response to changing cooperativeness in a simulated social partner. To identify when selection may favour high or low plasticity as a function of cooperativeness, we also developed an evolutionary simulation model, where individuals probability of cooperating was modelled alongside their plasticity. Our empirical results suggest that guppies that have been bred to make high cooperative investments in the context of predator inspection exhibit higher plasticity when partners switch from defection to cooperation, compared to guppies bred to make lower cooperative investments. Our agent-based model found that more cooperative individuals will show greater plasticity in their propensity to cooperate, compared to less cooperative individuals, except when there are no consequences of nobody cooperating. Combined, our findings show that more cooperative individuals might benefit from a greater capacity to adjust behaviour than less cooperative individuals do. We suggest that this could facilitate assortment by cooperative phenotype, contributing to the evolution of this risky cooperative behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Weakly electric fish employ refuge-tracking behavior to survive, seeking and utilizing hiding places to shield themselves from predators and unfavorable environmental conditions. This adaptive mechanism enables them to minimize the risk of predation, maintain optimal electrocommunication, and adapt to changing surroundings. While studies have explored smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements of these fish in stationary environments, limited emphasis has been given to how varying flow speeds in their natural habitats may impact these behaviors. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of different flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements in weakly electric fish. Active sensing provides sensory data and multisensory integration processes and combines this data to create a holistic perception of the environment. The synergy between these processes is fundamental for enhancing an organism&#39;s sensory capabilities and enabling it to adapt and interact effectively with its surroundings. For this study, a specialized experimental setup was designed and built to facilitate refuge-tracking behavior under controlled flow conditions. The experiments involved Apteronotus albifrons fish exposed to visual and complex electrosensory stimuli, which consisted of a sum of sine signals. Data was recorded for different sensory conditions, including variations in flow speeds, illumination levels, and refuge structures. The analysis revealed that increased flow speeds correlated with reduced tracking gain and phase lag in the fish. Additionally, it was observed that active sensing movements were more pronounced in dark conditions. These findings highlight the significant impact of flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements and emphasize the importance of studying these behaviors within the context of water flow. Understanding the biological motivations underlying these effects is vital for their potential application in engineering fields.</p>
