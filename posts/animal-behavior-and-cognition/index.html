L.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552498\nThe mammalian olfactory system detects and discriminates between millions of odorants to elicit appropriate behavioral responses. While much has been learned about how olfactory sensory neurons detect odorants and signal their presence, how specific innate, unlearned behaviors are initiated in response to ethologically relevant odors remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the 4-transmembrane protein CD20, also known as MS4A1, is expressed in a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium of the murine nasal cavity and functions as a mammalian odorant receptor that recognizes compounds produced by mouse predators. While wild-type mice avoid these predator odorants, mice genetically deleted of CD20 do not appropriately respond. Together, this work reveals a novel CD20-mediated odor-sensing mechanism in the mammalian olfactory system that triggers innate behaviors critical for organismal survival.\nNatural disaster alters the adaptive benefits of sociality\nAuthors: Testard, C.; Shergold, C.; Acevedo-Ithier, A.; Hart, J.; Negron-Del Valle, J.; Philips, D.; Watowich, M.; Sanguinetti-Scheck, J.

How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems. One-Sentence SummaryTestard et al. show that natural disasters alter the adaptive benefits of sociality triggering persistent behavioral changes in animals.\nSeeking voluntary passive movement in flies is play-like behavior\nAuthors: Triphan, T.; Huetteroth, W.\nScore: 63.0, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551880\nPlay-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration. One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek self-stimulation on a carousel.

E.; Stewart, F.; Wilke, C.; Zuberbühler, K.; Hobaiter, C.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.551967\nParsing signals from noise is a general problem for signallers and recipients, as well as for researchers studying communicative systems. Substantial research efforts have been invested in comparing how other species encode information and meaning in their signals, and how signalling is structured. However, our ability to do so depends on identifying and discriminating signals that represent meaningful units of analysis. Early approaches to defining signal repertoires applied top- down approaches, classifying cases into predefined signal types. Recently, more labour-intensive methods have taken a bottom-up approach describing the features of each signal in detail and clustering cases into types based on patterns of similarity between them in multi-dimensional feature-space that were previously undetectable. Nevertheless, it remains essential to assess whether the resulting repertoires are composed of relevant units from the perspective of the species using them, and redefining repertoires when additional data makes more detailed analyses feasible. In this paper we provide a framework that takes data from the largest set of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) gestures currently available, splitting gesture types at a fine scale based on modifying features of gesture expression and then determining whether this splitting process increases the information content of the communication system. Our method allows different features of interest to be incorporated into the splitting process, providing substantial future flexibility across - for example - species, populations, and levels of signal granularity. In doing so we provide a powerful tool allowing researchers interested in gestural communication to establish repertoires of relevant units for subsequent analyses within and between systems of communication.\nFawn bedsite selection by a large ungulate living in a peri-urban area\nAuthors: Conteddu, K.; Wilson, K.; Amin, B.; Chari, S.; Haigh, A.; Griffin, L.

F.; Ciuti, S.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552922\nHuman populations continue to grow at an unprecedented pace, alongside the anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, appreciate wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and inform wildlife management decisions. Here, we studied how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns adapted their behaviour during the birthing period in the largest urban park of Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) access, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing the bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least ~200m. Bedsites were unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Fallow deer mothers also were found to select for dense understory vegetation for their fawns bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal them. Our results give a very detailed overview of the behavioural adaptations of fallow deer mothers during fawning, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites and alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.\nBunDLe-Net: Neuronal Manifold Learning Meets Behaviour\nAuthors: Kumar, A.; Gilra, A.; Gonzalez-Soto, M.; Grosse-Wentrup, M.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.551978\nNeuronal manifold learning techniques represent high-dimensional neuronal dynamics in low-dimensional embeddings to reveal the intrinsic structure of neuronal manifolds. Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BunDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BunDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BunDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BunDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.\nWistar rats raised in an affectionate environment display lifesaving-like behaviors while distinguishing life from death\nAuthors: Mikami, K.; Kigami, Y.; Doi, T.; Choudhury, M. E.; Nishikawa, Y.; Takahashi, R.; Wada, Y.; Kakine, H.; Kawase, M.; Hiyama, N.; Yano, H.; Abe, N.; Yorozuya, T.; Nishihara, T.; Tanaka, J.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552239\nIt is generally believed that humans are the only species that values life. However, it is not well understood whether animals have a nature that values life. In this study, we attempted to determine whether male Wistar rats have this nature. Normally-reared rats did not show lifesaving-like actions towards anesthesia-induced comatose rats, although they seemed to distinguish life from death. Considering the possibility that different rearing conditions may foster a life-valuing nature, male Wistar rat pups were reared in several ways: normal rearing, loving rearing (LR; rats reared as if they were cute pets), rearing in an enriched environment, reared with gentle stroking of the back, and normal rearing of offspring of rats raised under LR conditions. When placed in an anxiety-producing environment, only LR rats escaped into the hands of the person who reared them, indicating attachment. Only the LR rats displayed lifesaving-like actions towards unknown comatose rats or drowning pups. LR rats also stopped attacks by biting ICR mice that were attacking C57BL/6 mice. Thus, rearing in an affectionate environment may foster a life-valuing nature, even in rats, suggesting that the valuing of life may be neither innate nor human-specific.\nThe discovery of mixed colonies in Temnothorax ants supports the territoriality hypothesis of dulotic social parasite evolution in myrmicine ants\nAuthors: Bengston, S. E.; Dornhaus, A.; Rabeling, C.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.552493\nSocial parasitism, where one social species parasitically depends on the other for survival and reproduction, is a highly successful life history strategy, especially in the eusocial Hymenoptera. In ants alone, more 400 species of socially parasitic species exist and multiple forms of social parasitism evolved independently and convergently. Yet disentangling the evolutionary history of obligate social parasitism is challenging. Identifying species that inform the transition from eusocial toward socially parasitic behavior is crucial for understanding the underlying co-evolutionary processes. Here, we report the first case of mixed colonies involving four predominantly free-living Temnothorax ant species from the western United States. Three Temnothorax species supplement their worker force with brood from the nests of their four congeners. We suggest, based on these observations and other published evidence, that this facultative dulotic behavior may have resulted from territorial contests due to limited nest sites. Socially parasitic behavior is not present in all populations across the species distribution ranges, however in populations where this behavior was observed, it is also associated with significant increases in interspecific aggression. These four species of Western US Temnothorax ants represent a particularly interesting case of social parasitism, because the presence of between-population behavioral variation provides a powerful system to test hypotheses about the ecological and behavioral conditions underlying the evolutionary transition from eusocial to socially parasitic behavior.\nA two-process model of Drosophila sleep reveals an inter-dependence between circadian clock speed and the rate of sleep pressure decay.\nAuthors: Abhilash, L.; Shafer, O. T.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.12.503775\nSleep is controlled by two processes - a circadian clock that regulates its timing and a homeostat that regulates the drive to sleep. Drosophila has been an insightful model for understanding both processes. For four decades, Borbely and Daans two-process model has provided a powerful framework for understanding how circadian and homeostatic processes regulate sleep. However, the field of fly sleep has not employed such a model as a framework for the investigation of sleep. To this end, we have adapted the two-process model to the fly and establish its utility by showing that it can provide empirically testable predictions regarding the circadian and homeostatic control of fly sleep. We show that the ultradian rhythms previously reported for loss-of-function clock mutants are a predictable consequence of a functional sleep homeostat in the absence of a functioning circadian system. We find that a model in which the circadian clock speed and homeostatic rates act without influencing each other provides imprecise predictions regarding how clock speed influences the strength of sleep rhythms and the amount of daily sleep. We also find that quantitatively good fits between empirical values and model predictions were achieved only when clock speeds were positively correlated with rates of decay of sleep pressure. Our results indicate that longer sleep bouts better reflect the homeostatic process than the current definition of sleep as any inactivity lasting five minutes or more. This two-process model represents a powerful framework for future work on the molecular and physiological regulation of fly sleep.\n5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptor antagonism differentially modulates reinforcement learning and cognitive flexibility: behavioral and computational evidence\nAuthors: El-Sayed Hervig, M.; Zuhlsdorff, K.; Olesen, S. F.; Phillips, B.; Bozic, T.; Cardinal, R.; Dalley, J. W.; Alsio, J.; Robbins, T.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.545287\nCognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt behavior in response to a changing environment, is disrupted in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Evidence suggests that flexibility, which can be operationalized using reversal learning tasks, is modulated by serotonergic transmission. However, how exactly flexible behavior and associated reinforcement learning (RL) processes are modulated by 5-HT action on specific receptors is unknown. We investigated the effects of 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) antagonism on cognitive flexibility and underlying RL mechanisms. Thirty-six male Lister hooded rats were trained on a touchscreen visual discrimination and reversal task. We evaluated the effects of systemic treatments with the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR antagonists M100907 and SB-242084, respectively, on reversal learning performance and performance on probe trials where correct and incorrect stimuli were presented with a third, probabilistically rewarded, stimulus. Computational models were fitted to task choice data to extract RL parameters, including a novel model designed specifically for this task. 5-HT2AR antagonism impaired reversal learning during certain phases. 5-HT2CR antagonism, on the other hand, impaired learning from positive feedback. RL models further differentiated these effects. 5-HT2AR antagonism decreased punishment learning rate at high and low doses. The low dose also increased exploration (beta) and increased stimulus and side stickiness (kappa). 5-HT2CR antagonism also increased beta, but reduced side stickiness. These data indicate that 5-HT2A and 5-HT2CRs both modulate different aspects of flexibility, with 5-HT2ARs modulating learning from negative feedback and 5-HT2cRs for learning from positive feedback.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian olfactory system detects and discriminates between millions of odorants to elicit appropriate behavioral responses. While much has been learned about how olfactory sensory neurons detect odorants and signal their presence, how specific innate, unlearned behaviors are initiated in response to ethologically relevant odors remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the 4-transmembrane protein CD20, also known as MS4A1, is expressed in a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium of the murine nasal cavity and functions as a mammalian odorant receptor that recognizes compounds produced by mouse predators. While wild-type mice avoid these predator odorants, mice genetically deleted of CD20 do not appropriately respond. Together, this work reveals a novel CD20-mediated odor-sensing mechanism in the mammalian olfactory system that triggers innate behaviors critical for organismal survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global warming intensifies weather-related disasters that radically alter ecosystems. How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems.

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

        <p class="abstract">Parsing signals from noise is a general problem for signallers and recipients, as well as for researchers studying communicative systems. Substantial research efforts have been invested in comparing how other species encode information and meaning in their signals, and how signalling is structured. However, our ability to do so depends on identifying and discriminating signals that represent meaningful units of analysis. Early approaches to defining signal repertoires applied top- down approaches, classifying cases into predefined signal types. Recently, more labour-intensive methods have taken a bottom-up approach describing the features of each signal in detail and clustering cases into types based on patterns of similarity between them in multi-dimensional feature-space that were previously undetectable. Nevertheless, it remains essential to assess whether the resulting repertoires are composed of relevant units from the perspective of the species using them, and redefining repertoires when additional data makes more detailed analyses feasible. In this paper we provide a framework that takes data from the largest set of wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) gestures currently available, splitting gesture types at a fine scale based on modifying features of gesture expression and then determining whether this splitting process increases the information content of the communication system. Our method allows different features of interest to be incorporated into the splitting process, providing substantial future flexibility across - for example - species, populations, and levels of signal granularity. In doing so we provide a powerful tool allowing researchers interested in gestural communication to establish repertoires of relevant units for subsequent analyses within and between systems of communication.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human populations continue to grow at an unprecedented pace, alongside the anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, appreciate wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and inform wildlife management decisions. Here, we studied how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns adapted their behaviour during the birthing period in the largest urban park of Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) access, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing the bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least ~200m. Bedsites were unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Fallow deer mothers also were found to select for dense understory vegetation for their fawns bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal them. Our results give a very detailed overview of the behavioural adaptations of fallow deer mothers during fawning, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites and alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neuronal manifold learning techniques represent high-dimensional neuronal dynamics in low-dimensional embeddings to reveal the intrinsic structure of neuronal manifolds. Common to these techniques is their goal to learn low-dimensional embeddings that preserve all dynamic information in the high-dimensional neuronal data, i.e., embeddings that allow for reconstructing the original data. We introduce a novel neuronal manifold learning technique, BunDLe-Net, that learns a low-dimensional Markovian embedding of the neuronal dynamics which preserves only those aspects of the neuronal dynamics that are relevant for a given behavioural context. In this way, BunDLe-Net eliminates neuronal dynamics that are irrelevant to decoding behaviour, effectively de-noising the data to reveal better the intricate relationships between neuronal dynamics and behaviour. We demonstrate the quantitative superiority of BunDLe-Net over commonly used and state-of-the-art neuronal manifold learning techniques in terms of dynamic and behavioural information in the learned manifold on calcium imaging data recorded in the nematode C. elegans. Qualitatively, we show that BunDLe-Net learns highly consistent manifolds across multiple worms that reveal the neuronal and behavioural motifs that form the building blocks of the neuronal manifold.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is generally believed that humans are the only species that values life. However, it is not well understood whether animals have a nature that values life. In this study, we attempted to determine whether male Wistar rats have this nature. Normally-reared rats did not show lifesaving-like actions towards anesthesia-induced comatose rats, although they seemed to distinguish life from death. Considering the possibility that different rearing conditions may foster a life-valuing nature, male Wistar rat pups were reared in several ways: normal rearing, loving rearing (LR; rats reared as if they were cute pets), rearing in an enriched environment, reared with gentle stroking of the back, and normal rearing of offspring of rats raised under LR conditions. When placed in an anxiety-producing environment, only LR rats escaped into the hands of the person who reared them, indicating attachment. Only the LR rats displayed lifesaving-like actions towards unknown comatose rats or drowning pups. LR rats also stopped attacks by biting ICR mice that were attacking C57BL/6 mice. Thus, rearing in an affectionate environment may foster a life-valuing nature, even in rats, suggesting that the valuing of life may be neither innate nor human-specific.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social parasitism, where one social species parasitically depends on the other for survival and reproduction, is a highly successful life history strategy, especially in the eusocial Hymenoptera. In ants alone, more 400 species of socially parasitic species exist and multiple forms of social parasitism evolved independently and convergently. Yet disentangling the evolutionary history of obligate social parasitism is challenging. Identifying species that inform the transition from eusocial toward socially parasitic behavior is crucial for understanding the underlying co-evolutionary processes. Here, we report the first case of mixed colonies involving four predominantly free-living Temnothorax ant species from the western United States. Three Temnothorax species supplement their worker force with brood from the nests of their four congeners. We suggest, based on these observations and other published evidence, that this facultative dulotic behavior may have resulted from territorial contests due to limited nest sites. Socially parasitic behavior is not present in all populations across the species distribution ranges, however in populations where this behavior was observed, it is also associated with significant increases in interspecific aggression. These four species of Western US Temnothorax ants represent a particularly interesting case of social parasitism, because the presence of between-population behavioral variation provides a powerful system to test hypotheses about the ecological and behavioral conditions underlying the evolutionary transition from eusocial to socially parasitic behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep is controlled by two processes - a circadian clock that regulates its timing and a homeostat that regulates the drive to sleep. Drosophila has been an insightful model for understanding both processes. For four decades, Borbely and Daans two-process model has provided a powerful framework for understanding how circadian and homeostatic processes regulate sleep. However, the field of fly sleep has not employed such a model as a framework for the investigation of sleep. To this end, we have adapted the two-process model to the fly and establish its utility by showing that it can provide empirically testable predictions regarding the circadian and homeostatic control of fly sleep. We show that the ultradian rhythms previously reported for loss-of-function clock mutants are a predictable consequence of a functional sleep homeostat in the absence of a functioning circadian system. We find that a model in which the circadian clock speed and homeostatic rates act without influencing each other provides imprecise predictions regarding how clock speed influences the strength of sleep rhythms and the amount of daily sleep. We also find that quantitatively good fits between empirical values and model predictions were achieved only when clock speeds were positively correlated with rates of decay of sleep pressure. Our results indicate that longer sleep bouts better reflect the homeostatic process than the current definition of sleep as any inactivity lasting five minutes or more. This two-process model represents a powerful framework for future work on the molecular and physiological regulation of fly sleep.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adapt behavior in response to a changing environment, is disrupted in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Evidence suggests that flexibility, which can be operationalized using reversal learning tasks, is modulated by serotonergic transmission. However, how exactly flexible behavior and associated reinforcement learning (RL) processes are modulated by 5-HT action on specific receptors is unknown.

We investigated the effects of 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR) antagonism on cognitive flexibility and underlying RL mechanisms. Thirty-six male Lister hooded rats were trained on a touchscreen visual discrimination and reversal task. We evaluated the effects of systemic treatments with the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR antagonists M100907 and SB-242084, respectively, on reversal learning performance and performance on probe trials where correct and incorrect stimuli were presented with a third, probabilistically rewarded, stimulus. Computational models were fitted to task choice data to extract RL parameters, including a novel model designed specifically for this task.

5-HT2AR antagonism impaired reversal learning during certain phases. 5-HT2CR antagonism, on the other hand, impaired learning from positive feedback. RL models further differentiated these effects. 5-HT2AR antagonism decreased punishment learning rate at high and low doses. The low dose also increased exploration (beta) and increased stimulus and side stickiness (kappa). 5-HT2CR antagonism also increased beta, but reduced side stickiness.

These data indicate that 5-HT2A and 5-HT2CRs both modulate different aspects of flexibility, with 5-HT2ARs modulating learning from negative feedback and 5-HT2cRs for learning from positive feedback.</p>
