Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.\nRapid body colouration change in Oryzias celebensisas a social signal for intraspecific competition\nAuthors: Ueda, R.; Ansai, S.; Takeuchi, H.\nScore: 47.8, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573172\nIn some species, such as chameleon and cichlid fish, rapid body colouration changes (within seconds or minutes) serve as visual social signals in male-male competition. This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.\nNoxious stimulation induces self-protective behaviour in bumblebees\nAuthors: Gibbons, M.; Pasquini, E.; Kowalewska, A.; Read, E.; Gibson, S.; Crump, A.; Solvi, C.; Versace, E.; Chittka, L.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575734\nSelf-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nLong mounting with repeated copulations in Zygogramma bicolorata: A test of adaptive significance of a curious mating behaviour\nAuthors: Pal, R. S.; Bhowmick, A.; Naik, K.; Nandy, B.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574980\nLong matings are abundant in insects despite the range of the costs involved. The causes and consequences of the evolution of long matings remain an interesting problem for behavioural ecologists. We studied the Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata), which is known to show extraordinarily long copulations. Our detailed investigation showed, for the first time, that the long mounting in this species entails repeated copulation. Each of these copulations is preceded and succeeded by a leg-rubbing behaviour. We found the same characteristic pattern in laboratory and semi-natural conditions. We conducted a series of interrupted mounting assays to examine the fitness consequences of the duration of mounting. We tested multiple hypotheses regarding the transfer of sperm and non-sperm components, and the function of leg rubbing in modulating the female copulatory behaviour. Sperm transfer and fertility did not exhibit a linear increase with the number of copulations. There was also no evidence of nutrient transfer by the males. In contrast, our experiments reveal significant cost of long mounting in these beetles. We showed female remating behaviour can be modulated by the long previous mounting. Our data also suggest that leg rubbing may reduce female resistance to mating. While the long mating possibly serves as copulatory mate guarding, the males may increase their competitive ability through modulating female remating. We also propose leg rubbing to be a copulatory courtship behaviour. Our study provides preliminary insights into the evolution of long mating in such systems and necessitates further research on sexual selection.\nUrban sensory conditions alter rival interactions and mate choice in urban and forest tungara frogs\nAuthors: Smit, J. A. H.; Thijssen, V.; Cronin, A. D.; Ellers, J.; Halfwerk, W.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575508\nSexual communication often takes place in networks with multiple competing signalers being simultaneously assessed by mate choosers. Altered sensory conditions, such as noise and light pollution, can affect communication by altering signal production and perception. While evidence of sensory pollution affecting sexual signaling is widespread, few studies assess impacts on sexual signaling during rival interactions as well as mate choice, let alone whether urban and forest populations have diverged in their response. Here, we investigate the effects of urban sensory conditions on sexual communication in urban and forest tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). We recorded dyadic vocal rival interactions and assessed mate choice with and without noise and light pollution in the lab. We show that urban sensory conditions can directly impact the intensity of rival interactions, differences between rivals and mate choice, though changes were often in opposite directions for frogs of urban and forest origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in rival interactions in response to light and noise pollution can also indirectly affect how females choose between potential mates. Our study reveals origin-dependent direct and indirect effects of noise and light pollution, which ultimately translate into fitness consequences for sexual communication in urban populations.\nAutomated behavioral analysis reveals that mice employ a bait-and-switch escape mechanism to de-escalate social conflict.\nAuthors: Clein, R.; Warren, M.; Neunuebel, J. P.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575321\nIntraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the males behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.\nCan social interactions rescue \"lost\" behavioural defences in an allopatric cuckoo host?\nAuthors: Tolman, D.; Rönkä, K.; Kluen, E.; Campobello, D.; Thorogood, R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575589\nSocial information use by cuckoo-hosts provides an excellent example of how social interactions within species can influence selection on another. Neighbours observe each others mobbing behaviour towards cuckoos, and then adjust costly defences back at their own nest in response. This may even allow naive juveniles to learn to recognise cuckoos, suggesting that social responsiveness must play a key part in determining how hosts respond to changing rates of brood parasitism. However, if the cultural memory of cuckoos is lost, can this plasticity in defences be rescued? This is fundamental for cuckoo-host coevolution, as the rates at which host defences are lost, gained, or retained determines evolutionary dynamics. Using populations of reed warblers at the northern- and southernmost extents of their range, we designed a field experiment to test whether populations allopatric to cuckoos (i) still recognise cuckoos as a threat, (ii) respond to social cues to upregulate defences, and (iii) vary in their strength of social responsiveness. We found defences and social responsiveness to be weaker in the south, where there is a much longer history of allopatry. In the north, only birds that retained recognition of cuckoos showed social responsiveness: social information about cuckoos did not increase hosts propensity to attack (whereas it doubled in the range core), but it did increase the strength of mobbing in the 30% of birds that recognised the cuckoo at the northern range front. Most importantly, however, experimental cuckoo eggs remained in the nest, whereas in previous experiments elsewhere the same social information increased egg rejection ten-fold. This suggests that social responsiveness is more limited at the range edges, under relaxed selection, and this would incur little immediate cost to cuckoos fitness if they (re)invade. Our study provides a rare example of geographic variation in social information use and highlights how current range expansions may influence the outcome of future species interactions.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nSound-seeking before and after hearing loss in mice\nAuthors: Mai, J.; Gargiullo, R.; Zheng, M.; Esho, V.; Hussein, O. E.; Pollay, E.; Bowe, C.; Williamson, L. M.; McElroy, A. F.; Goolsby, W. N.; Brooks, K. A.; Rodgers, C. C.\nScore: 22.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574475\nHow we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.\nDAMM for the detection and tracking of multiple animals within complex social and environmental settings\nAuthors: Kaul, G.; McDevitt, J.; Johnson, J.; Eban-Rothschild, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576153\nAccurate detection and tracking of animals across diverse environments are crucial for behavioral studies in various disciplines, including neuroscience. Recently, machine learning and computer vision techniques have become integral to the neuroscientist's toolkit, enabling high-throughput behavioral studies. Despite advancements in localizing individual animals in simple environments, the task remains challenging in complex conditions due to intra-class visual variability and environmental diversity. These limitations hinder studies in ethologically-relevant conditions, such as when animals are concealed within nests or in obscured environments. Moreover, current tools are laborious and time-consuming to employ, requiring extensive, setup-specific annotation and model training/validation procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce the 'Detect Any Mouse Model' (DAMM), a pretrained object detector for localizing mice in complex environments, capable of robust performance with zero to minimal additional training on new experimental setups. Our approach involves collecting and annotating a diverse dataset that encompasses single and multi-housed mice in various lighting conditions, experimental setups, and occlusion levels. We utilize the Mask R-CNN architecture for instance segmentation and validate DAMM's performance with no additional training data (zero-shot inference) and with few examples for fine-tuning (few-shot inference). DAMM excels in zero-shot inference, detecting mice, and even rats, in entirely unseen scenarios and further improves with minimal additional training. By integrating DAMM with the SORT algorithm, we demonstrate robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based methods. Finally, to advance and simplify behavioral studies, we made DAMM accessible to the scientific community with a user-friendly Python API, shared model weights, and a Google Colab implementation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">This study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In some species, such as chameleon and cichlid fish, rapid body colouration changes (within seconds or minutes) serve as visual social signals in male-male competition. This study investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and body colouration changes in Oryzias celebensis, an Indonesian medaka fish. We analysed aggressive behaviours and corresponding body colouration changes during attack events in a controlled laboratory setting using groups of 3 adult fish in a small tank. In a triadic relationship consisting of 2 males and a female, males with blackened markings attacked more frequently than males without blackened markings and females. Additionally, we observed that the males with blackened markings were seldom attacked by males without blackened markings and females. These tendencies persisted even in groups consisting of 3 males. Our results suggest that the blackened markings in male O. celebensis not only indicate the level of aggression but also serve as a social signal to suppress attacks by other individuals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Long matings are abundant in insects despite the range of the costs involved. The causes and consequences of the evolution of long matings remain an interesting problem for behavioural ecologists. We studied the Parthenium beetle (Zygogramma bicolorata), which is known to show extraordinarily long copulations. Our detailed investigation showed, for the first time, that the long mounting in this species entails repeated copulation. Each of these copulations is preceded and succeeded by a leg-rubbing behaviour. We found the same characteristic pattern in laboratory and semi-natural conditions. We conducted a series of interrupted mounting assays to examine the fitness consequences of the duration of mounting. We tested multiple hypotheses regarding the transfer of sperm and non-sperm components, and the function of leg rubbing in modulating the female copulatory behaviour. Sperm transfer and fertility did not exhibit a linear increase with the number of copulations. There was also no evidence of nutrient transfer by the males. In contrast, our experiments reveal significant cost of long mounting in these beetles. We showed female remating behaviour can be modulated by the long previous mounting. Our data also suggest that leg rubbing may reduce female resistance to mating. While the long mating possibly serves as copulatory mate guarding, the males may increase their competitive ability through modulating female remating. We also propose leg rubbing to be a copulatory courtship behaviour. Our study provides preliminary insights into the evolution of long mating in such systems and necessitates further research on sexual selection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sexual communication often takes place in networks with multiple competing signalers being simultaneously assessed by mate choosers. Altered sensory conditions, such as noise and light pollution, can affect communication by altering signal production and perception. While evidence of sensory pollution affecting sexual signaling is widespread, few studies assess impacts on sexual signaling during rival interactions as well as mate choice, let alone whether urban and forest populations have diverged in their response. Here, we investigate the effects of urban sensory conditions on sexual communication in urban and forest tungara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus). We recorded dyadic vocal rival interactions and assessed mate choice with and without noise and light pollution in the lab. We show that urban sensory conditions can directly impact the intensity of rival interactions, differences between rivals and mate choice, though changes were often in opposite directions for frogs of urban and forest origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that changes in rival interactions in response to light and noise pollution can also indirectly affect how females choose between potential mates. Our study reveals origin-dependent direct and indirect effects of noise and light pollution, which ultimately translate into fitness consequences for sexual communication in urban populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, Mus musculus, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A prominent behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the males behavioral state and the interacting partners could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male-female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social information use by cuckoo-hosts provides an excellent example of how social interactions within species can influence selection on another. Neighbours observe each others mobbing behaviour towards cuckoos, and then adjust costly defences back at their own nest in response. This may even allow naive juveniles to  learn to recognise cuckoos, suggesting that  social responsiveness must play a key part in determining how hosts respond to changing rates of brood parasitism. However, if the  cultural memory of cuckoos is lost, can this plasticity in defences be rescued? This is fundamental for cuckoo-host coevolution, as the rates at which host defences are lost, gained, or retained determines evolutionary dynamics. Using populations of reed warblers at the northern- and southernmost extents of their range, we designed a field experiment to test whether populations allopatric to cuckoos (i) still recognise cuckoos as a threat, (ii) respond to social cues to upregulate defences, and (iii) vary in their strength of social responsiveness. We found defences and social responsiveness to be weaker in the south, where there is a much longer history of allopatry. In the north, only birds that retained recognition of cuckoos showed social responsiveness: social information about cuckoos did not increase hosts propensity to attack (whereas it doubled in the range core), but it did increase the strength of mobbing in the 30% of birds that recognised the cuckoo at the northern range front. Most importantly, however, experimental cuckoo eggs remained in the nest, whereas in previous experiments elsewhere the same social information increased egg rejection ten-fold. This suggests that social responsiveness is more limited at the range edges, under relaxed selection, and this would incur little immediate cost to cuckoos fitness if they (re)invade. Our study provides a rare example of geographic variation in social information use and highlights how current range expansions may influence the outcome of future species interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How we move our bodies affects how we perceive sound. For instance, we can explore an environment to seek out the source of a sound and we can use head movements to compensate for hearing loss. How we do this is not well understood because many auditory experiments are designed to limit head and body movements. To study the role of movement in hearing, we developed a behavioral task called sound-seeking that rewarded mice for tracking down an ongoing sound source. Over the course of learning, mice more efficiently navigated to the sound. We then asked how auditory behavior was affected by hearing loss induced by surgical removal of the malleus from the middle ear. An innate behavior, the auditory startle response, was abolished by bilateral hearing loss and unaffected by unilateral hearing loss. Similarly, performance on the sound-seeking task drastically declined after bilateral hearing loss and did not recover. In striking contrast, mice with unilateral hearing loss were only transiently impaired on sound-seeking; over a recovery period of about a week, they regained high levels of performance, increasingly reliant on a different spatial sampling strategy. Thus, even in the face of permanent unilateral damage to the peripheral auditory system, mice recover their ability to perform a naturalistic sound-seeking task. This paradigm provides an opportunity to examine how body movement enables better hearing and resilient adaptation to sensory deprivation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate detection and tracking of animals across diverse environments are crucial for behavioral studies in various disciplines, including neuroscience. Recently, machine learning and computer vision techniques have become integral to the neuroscientist&#39;s toolkit, enabling high-throughput behavioral studies. Despite advancements in localizing individual animals in simple environments, the task remains challenging in complex conditions due to intra-class visual variability and environmental diversity. These limitations hinder studies in ethologically-relevant conditions, such as when animals are concealed within nests or in obscured environments. Moreover, current tools are laborious and time-consuming to employ, requiring extensive, setup-specific annotation and model training/validation procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce the &#39;Detect Any Mouse Model&#39; (DAMM), a pretrained object detector for localizing mice in complex environments, capable of robust performance with zero to minimal additional training on new experimental setups. Our approach involves collecting and annotating a diverse dataset that encompasses single and multi-housed mice in various lighting conditions, experimental setups, and occlusion levels. We utilize the Mask R-CNN architecture for instance segmentation and validate DAMM&#39;s performance with no additional training data (zero-shot inference) and with few examples for fine-tuning (few-shot inference). DAMM excels in zero-shot inference, detecting mice, and even rats, in entirely unseen scenarios and further improves with minimal additional training. By integrating DAMM with the SORT algorithm, we demonstrate robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based methods. Finally, to advance and simplify behavioral studies, we made DAMM accessible to the scientific community with a user-friendly Python API, shared model weights, and a Google Colab implementation.</p>
