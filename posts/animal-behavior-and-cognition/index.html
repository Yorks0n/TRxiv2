Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an \"internal world\" to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents' confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents' assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (\u003e85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work.\nAcute exposure to caffeine improves navigation in an invasive ant\nAuthors: Galante, H.; De Agro, M.; Koch, A.; Kau, S.; Czaczkes, T. J.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.561519\nInvasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the rewards location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ants ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.\nFARESHARE: An Open-source Apparatus for Assessing Drinking Microstructure in Socially Housed Rats\nAuthors: Frie, J. A.; Khokhar, J. Y.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561248\nSocial factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.\nMetamorphosis reverses the risk-taking behavioral phenotype in moor frog along a latitudinal gradient\nAuthors: Cortazar-Chinarro, M.; Corral-Lopez, A.; Ludtke, D.; Luquet, E.; Laurila, A.\nScore: 4.9, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562178\nUnderstanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.\nPhysically stressed bees expect less reward in an active choice judgement bias test\nAuthors: Procenko, O.; Read, J.; Nityananda, V.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-10-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561175\nEmotion-like states in animals are commonly assessed using judgment bias tests, which measure responses to ambiguous information. A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.\nThe impact of prenatal alcohol and synthetic cannabinoid exposure on behavioral adaptations in adolescent offspring and alcohol self-administration in adulthood\nAuthors: Ornelas, L. C.; Fish, E. W.; Dooley, J. C.; Carroll, M. C.; Parnell, S. E.; Besheer, J.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561571\nPrenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol + CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.\nLearning modifies attention during bumblebee visual search\nAuthors: Robert, T.; Tarapata, K.; Nityananda, V.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.561037\nThe role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher-or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward. Significance StatementStudies investigating how foraging bees learn about reward typically focus on the choices made by the bees. How bees deploy attention and visual search during foraging is less well studied. We analysed flight videos to characterise visual search as bees learn which flowers are rewarding. We found that learning increases the focus of bees on flower regions. We also found that the quality of the reward a flower offers influences how much bees search in non-flower areas. This means that a flower with lower reward attracts less focussed foraging compared to one with a higher reward. Since flowers do differ in floral reward, this has important implications for how focussed pollinators will be on different flowers. Our approach of looking at search behaviour and attention thus advances our understanding of the cognitive ecology of pollination.\nInformation gathering explains decision dynamics during human and monkey reward foraging\nAuthors: Barack, D. L.; Parodi, F.; Ludwig, V.; Platt, M. L.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.562362\nForaging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest - lingering too long in depleting patches - is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.\nAcute avoidance of hydrogen sulfide is modulated by external and internal states in C. elegans\nAuthors: Pu, L.; Zhao, L.; Wang, J.; Henriksson, J.; Laurent, P.; Chen, C.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561535\nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.\nSocial bond dynamics and the evolution of helping\nAuthors: Leimar, O.; Bshary, R.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561838\nEmpiricists often struggle to apply game theory models to real-life cases of animal cooperation. One reason is that many examples of cooperation occur in stable groups, where costs and benefits of helping depend on several factors. Among these are variable investments, fitness interdependencies, learning, memory, reciprocity, and partner choice, including the formation of social bonds with specific group members. Here, we present a game theory model exploring the conditions under which social bonds between group members can promote cooperation, with reciprocal acts of helping. In the model, bonds build up from exchanges of help in a similar way as the strength of association increases in learning, as in the Rescorla-Wagner rule. The bonds in turn affect partner choice and influence helping amounts. The model has a mechanism of reciprocity for bonded pairs, which can evolve towards either loose or strict reciprocation. Several aspects of the model are inspired by observations of food sharing in vampire bats. We find that small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping, either as small group sizes, or if members of larger groups can form temporary (daily) smaller groupings. The evolutionary outcome is a fairly low cost helping, while the benefit of receiving help can be substantial. Individuals in need request help based on bond strength, but there is also an evolved preference for initiating bonds with new group members. In contrast, if different groups come into temporary contact with each other, the evolved tendency is to avoid forming bonds between groups. Popular science summaryThe search for evolutionary explanations of cooperation between members of social groups has long been a high profile endeavour. A case of particular interest is when individuals develop a network of friends and exchange help through these social bonds. The question of helping between friends was given emphasis already from the start of the evolutionary study of cooperation, more than 50 years ago, but it has remained without any decisive progress since that time. Here we present a game-theory analysis of helping through the build-up of social bonds. We find that there is reciprocity in socially bonded pairs, which is neither immediate nor very strict, and that relatively small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Do animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an &#34;internal world&#34; to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents&#39; confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents&#39; assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (&gt;85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Invasive alien species are a major and growing problem, devastating ecosystems and costing billions of euros in damage and control efforts. Argentine ants, Linepithema humile, are particularly concerning, with control efforts often falling short likely due to a lack of sufficient bait consumption. Using neuroactives to manipulate ant navigation and learning could increase recruitment and consumption, ultimately leading to more efficient control strategies. Caffeine is naturally occurring, cheap, and has been found to cause motivational and cognitive improvements in bees. Here, we subject L. humile to a wide range of caffeine concentrations and a complex but ecologically relevant task: an open landscape foraging experiment. Without caffeine, we find no effect of consecutive foraging visits on the time the ants take to reach a reward, suggesting a failure to learn the rewards location. However, low (25ppm) to intermediate (250ppm) concentrations of caffeine lead to a decrease of up to 38% in the time taken to find the reward during each consecutive visit, implying that caffeine boosts learning. Interestingly, such improvements are lost at high (2000ppm) doses. In contrast, caffeine appears to have no impact on the ants homing behaviour, as the time required to reach the nest was similar across treatments. The effect of caffeine is thus not only dose-dependent, but also differentially targets neurologically distinct navigational mechanisms. Adding moderate levels of caffeine to baits could be a simple way to improve ants ability to learn its location, potentially leading to increased recruitment to, and consumption of, the toxicant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social factors have been shown to play a significant and lasting role in alcohol consumption. Studying the role of social context on alcohol drinking is important to understand the factors that contribute to initiation or maintenance of casual and problematic alcohol use, as well as those that may be protective. A substantial body of preclinical research has shown that social environment such as housing conditions and social rank plays an important role in alcohol consumption and preference, though the extent of these effects have been obfuscated by methodological differences and technical challenges. Robust individual differences in alcohol intake in socially housed animals are difficult to track when animals share a common fluid source. Commercial solutions are prohibitively expensive and are limited by proprietary software and hardware (including caging systems). Here we describe an affordable, open-source solution for tracking fluid consumption in socially housed rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding how demographic processes and environmental conditions affect behavioral variation across populations is pivotal in evolutionary biology. However, as strong evidence accumulates for how these factors drive differences in behavior across populations, the role that such processes play in the link between behavior and life-history traits remains unclear. To study this, we collected moor frog eggs (Rana arvalis) from multiple populations ranging along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe. We then raised tadpoles in a common garden experiment, assessing developmental growth and risk-taking behavior of over 300 individuals when reaching well-known larval developmental stages in anurans (tadpoles, Gosner stage 32, and froglets, Gosner stage 42). We found striking behavioral differences across regions and developmental stages. Specifically, tadpoles raised from northernmost regions took shorter times to leave a shelter, were more active and more exploratory in an open field test than tadpoles from southern populations. These behavioral patterns were reversed when individuals were evaluated as froglets in comparisons between these regions. Further analyses incorporating life-history traits indicated a strong association between developmental growth and time to leave the shelter, with contrasting patterns across developmental stages. Together, our results reflect a decoupling of correlations between behavioral and life history traits across developmental stages in species with complex life cycles as a response to the ecological and demographic constraints that they endure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Emotion-like states in animals are commonly assessed using judgment bias tests, which measure responses to ambiguous information. A few studies have recently used these tests to argue for the presence of emotion-like states in insects. However, the results from most of these studies could have other explanations, including changes in motivation and attention. To control for these explanations, we therefore developed a novel judgment bias test, requiring bumblebees to make an active choice indicating their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Bumblebees were trained to associate high or low rewards, delivered in two different reward chambers, with distinct colors. Two groups of bees were then physically stressed by shaking or trapping, while the third group served as a control. We subsequently presented the bees with ambiguous colors between the two learnt colors and noted which reward chamber they chose. When presented with ambiguous colors, stressed bees were less likely than control bees to enter the reward chamber previously associated with high reward. We modelled bee behavior using signal detection and drift diffusion models and showed that control bees and stressed bees were, respectively, more likely to respond optimistically and pessimistically to ambiguous cues. The signal detection model further showed that the behavior of stressed bees was explained by a reduction in their prior expectation of high rewards. Our findings thus provide strong evidence for emotion-like states in bees and suggest that their stress-induced pessimistic behavior is explained by a reduced expectation of higher rewards.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Prenatal exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids can produce enduring neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes in the offspring. Furthermore, prenatal co-exposure to alcohol and cannabinoids induces malformations in brain regions associated with reward and stress-related circuitry. This study examined the effects of co-exposure to alcohol and the synthetic cannabinoid (SCB) CP55,940 throughout gastrulation and neurulation in rats on basal corticosterone levels and a battery of behavioral tests during adolescence and alcohol self-administration in adulthood. Importantly, we find that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) caused lower baseline corticosterone levels in adolescent males and females. Co-exposure to alcohol &#43; CP produced hyperactivity during open field test in males, but not females. During the two-bottle choice alcohol-drinking procedure, prenatal cannabinoid exposed male and female adolescent rats drank more alcohol than their vehicle-exposed controls. In adulthood, female rats treated with prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), showed an overall total increase in alcohol intake during alcohol self-administration; but this was not found in males. When the reinforcer was changed to a 1% sucrose solution, male rats exposed to PCE, showed a reduced self-administration compared to vehicle-exposed males, potentially indicative of an anhedonic response. This lower self-administration persisted when 20% alcohol was reintroduced to the sucrose solution. Lastly, following an abstinence period, there were no changes due to prenatal drug exposure in either males or females. Overall, these data suggest lasting consequences of prenatal alcohol and cannabinoid exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male and female rats.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of visual search during bee foraging is relatively understudied compared to the choices made by bees. As bees learn about rewards, we predicted that visual search would be modified to prioritise rewarding flowers. To test this, we ran an experiment testing how bee search differs in the initial and later part of training as they learn about flowers with either higher-or lower-quality rewards. We then ran an experiment to see how this prior training with reward influences their search on a subsequent task with different flowers. We used the time spent inspecting flowers as a measure of attention and found that learning increased attention to rewards and away from distractors. Higher quality rewards led to decreased attention to non-flower regions, but lower quality rewards did not. Prior experience of lower rewards also led to more attention to higher rewards compared to distractors and non-flower regions. Our results suggest that flowers would elicit differences in bee search behaviour depending on the sugar content of their nectar. They also demonstrate the utility of studying visual search and have important implications for understanding the pollination ecology of flowers with different qualities of reward.

Significance StatementStudies investigating how foraging bees learn about reward typically focus on the choices made by the bees. How bees deploy attention and visual search during foraging is less well studied. We analysed flight videos to characterise visual search as bees learn which flowers are rewarding. We found that learning increases the focus of bees on flower regions. We also found that the quality of the reward a flower offers influences how much bees search in non-flower areas. This means that a flower with lower reward attracts less focussed foraging compared to one with a higher reward. Since flowers do differ in floral reward, this has important implications for how focussed pollinators will be on different flowers. Our approach of looking at search behaviour and attention thus advances our understanding of the cognitive ecology of pollination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Foraging in humans and other animals requires a delicate balance between exploitation of current resources and exploration for new ones. The tendency to overharvest - lingering too long in depleting patches - is a routine behavioral deviation from predictions of optimal foraging theories. To characterize the computational mechanisms driving these deviations, we modeled foraging behavior using a virtual patch-leaving task with human participants and validated our findings in an analogous foraging task in two monkeys. Both humans and monkeys overharvested and stayed longer in patches with longer travel times compared to shorter ones. Critically, patch residence times in both species declined over the course of sessions, enhancing reward rates in humans. These decisions were best explained by a logistic transformation that integrated both current rewards and information about declining rewards. This parsimonious model demystifies both the occurrence and dynamics of overharvesting, highlighting the role of information gathering in foraging. Our findings provide insight into computational mechanisms shaped by ubiquitous foraging dilemmas, underscoring how behavioral modeling can reveal underlying motivations of seemingly irrational decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can act as an energy source, a poison and a gasotransmitter in organisms. We used the robust locomotory responses to H2S in Caenorhabditis elegans to delineate the molecular mechanisms governing sensory and adaptive responses to H2S exposure. We found that C. elegans exhibited transiently increased locomotory activity and turning behavior as a strategy to escape the noxious H2S stimulation. The behavioral responses to H2S were modulated by a complex network of signaling pathways, including cyclic GMP signaling in ciliated sensory neurons, calcineurin, nuclear hormone receptors, to the major starvation regulators such as insulin and TGF-{beta} signaling. The response to H2S was substantially affected by the ambient O2 levels and their prior experience in low O2 environments, suggesting an intricate interplay between O2 and H2S sensing mechanisms. Prolonged exposure to H2S robustly evoked H2S detoxification coupled with reduced locomotory response to the subsequent H2S challenges. Intriguingly, the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis, including ftn-1 and smf-3, was substantially modified in exposure to H2S, implying that labile iron levels are affected by H2S. In support of this, iron supplement significantly bolstered the behavioral response to H2S. In addition, mitochondria, one of the central hubs for H2S metabolism, played a crucial role in adaptive responses to H2S. In summary, our study provides molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H2S.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Empiricists often struggle to apply game theory models to real-life cases of animal cooperation. One reason is that many examples of cooperation occur in stable groups, where costs and benefits of helping depend on several factors. Among these are variable investments, fitness interdependencies, learning, memory, reciprocity, and partner choice, including the formation of social bonds with specific group members. Here, we present a game theory model exploring the conditions under which social bonds between group members can promote cooperation, with reciprocal acts of helping. In the model, bonds build up from exchanges of help in a similar way as the strength of association increases in learning, as in the Rescorla-Wagner rule. The bonds in turn affect partner choice and influence helping amounts. The model has a mechanism of reciprocity for bonded pairs, which can evolve towards either loose or strict reciprocation. Several aspects of the model are inspired by observations of food sharing in vampire bats. We find that small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping, either as small group sizes, or if members of larger groups can form temporary (daily) smaller groupings. The evolutionary outcome is a fairly low cost helping, while the benefit of receiving help can be substantial. Individuals in need request help based on bond strength, but there is also an evolved preference for initiating bonds with new group members. In contrast, if different groups come into temporary contact with each other, the evolved tendency is to avoid forming bonds between groups.

Popular science summaryThe search for evolutionary explanations of cooperation between members of social groups has long been a high profile endeavour. A case of particular interest is when individuals develop a network of friends and exchange help through these social bonds. The question of helping between friends was given emphasis already from the start of the evolutionary study of cooperation, more than 50 years ago, but it has remained without any decisive progress since that time. Here we present a game-theory analysis of helping through the build-up of social bonds. We find that there is reciprocity in socially bonded pairs, which is neither immediate nor very strict, and that relatively small social neighbourhoods are required for the evolutionary stability of helping.</p>
