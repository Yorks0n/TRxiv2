L.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-10-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563859\nPrey-predator interactions have resulted in the evolution of many anti-predatory traits. One of them is the ability for prey to listen to predators and avoid them. Although prey anti-predatory behavioural responses to predator auditory cues are well described in a wide range of taxa, studies on whether butterflies change their behaviours in response to their predatory calls are lacking. Heliconius butterflies are unpalatable and form Mullerian mimicry rings as morphological defence strategies against their bird predators. Like many other butterflies in the Nymphalidae family, Heliconius butterflies possess auditory organs, which are hypothesized to have evolved to assist with predator detection. Here we test whether Heliconius melpomene change their behaviour in response to their predatory bird calls by observing the behaviour of male and female H. m. plessini exposed to calls of Heliconius avian predators: rufous-tailed jacamar, migratory Eastern kingbird, and resident tropical kingbird. We also exposed them to the calls of the toco toucan, a frugivorous bird as a control bird call, and an amplified greenhouse background noise as a noise control. We found that individuals changed their behaviour in response to jacamar calls only. Males increased their walking and fluttering behaviour, while females did not change their behaviour during the playback of the jacamar call. Intersexual behaviours like courtship, copulation, and abdomen lifting did not change in response to bird calls. Our findings suggest that despite having primary predatory defences like toxicity and being in a mimicry ring, H. m. plessini butterflies changed their behaviour in response to predator calls. Furthermore, this response was predator specific, as H. m. plesseni did not respond to either the Eastern kingbird or the tropic kingbird calls. This suggests that Heliconius butterflies may be able to differentiate predatory calls, and potentially the birds associated with those calls.\nAggression: A gut reaction? The effects of gut microbiome on aggression\nAuthors: Uzan-Yulzari, A.; Turjeman, S.; Getselter, D.; Rautava, S.; Isolauri, E.; Khatib, S.; Elliott, E.; Koren, O.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564110\nRecent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of wild-type mice germ free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.\nDNA metabarcoding reveals limited consumption of livestock and black rhinoceros by spotted hyenas in a prey-rich environment\nAuthors: Dheer, A.; Danabalan, R.; Pellizzone, A.; Davidian, E.; Naman, P.; Mazzoni, C.; Honer, O. P.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-10-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563067\nThe diet of large carnivores is of great interest to conservation managers, as it can reveal the extent of human-carnivore conflict and the impact of carnivores on species of high conservation priority. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA can identify species and is often more reliable in doing so than observational or morphological methods. Metabarcoding is particularly powerful at detecting elusive and rare species and has therefore become a widely applied tool in biodiversity research. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to determine the diet of spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro Crater, a protected area in Northern Tanzania surrounded by areas co-inhabited by pastoralists. We assessed which species hyenas preferably consumed over a 24-year period and how frequently they consumed pastoralist livestock and black rhinoceros, a species of high economic value and conservation priority. We further estimated the effects of three key socio-demographic variables - age, social rank, and sex - on the propensity of hyenas to consume livestock. We detected DNA from 20 species in 371 hyena feces. Hyenas preferably consumed blue wildebeest and Grants gazelle. Among the detected species were five domestic species and one wild species that lived in the pastoralist-inhabited areas but not the Crater. This shows that resident Crater hyenas undertake foraging trips to areas surrounding the Crater. DNA of domestic species however was rarely detected (4.1% of 434 detections), and predominantly in feces of old hyenas. This suggests that Crater hyenas rarely consume livestock and that livestock is mostly consumed by hyenas less capable of hunting fleet-footed and powerful wild prey. No DNA of black rhinoceros was detected in any of the samples, suggesting that Crater hyenas do not frequently consume rhinoceros. Our findings suggest that the impact of Crater hyenas on livestock and wildlife of high conservation priority is limited. Our study highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding to assess the extent of human-carnivore conflict and to guide evidence-based conservation efforts to promote coexistence of carnivores, humans and species of high conservation priority.\nA single bout of vigorous exercise decreases subsequent non-exercise physical activity and body temperature\nAuthors: Funabashi, D.; Dobashi, S.; Sameshima, K.; Sagayama, H.; Nishijima, T.; Matsui, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.563892\nExercise benefits the body and mind, but its weight loss effect is less than generally expected. Although this phenomenon is likely due to a decrease in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and thermogenesis following exercise, the underlying mechanisms and effects of exercise intensity remain unknown. Here we show the potential role of corticosterone dynamics in the decline in NEPA and thermogenesis following vigorous exercise. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were categorized into three groups: sedentary, moderate exercise, and vigorous exercise, with exercise groups undergoing a 30 min treadmill session. Using an intraperitoneally implanted activity monitor, NEPA and body temperature (BT) were monitored for two days before and three days after exercise. The daily synchrony between the NEPA and BT was evaluated using a cross-correlation function. Plasma corticosterone was also detected at 6 and 24 h after exercise. Notably, only the vigorous exercise group exhibited a decline in both NEPA and BT, and increased body weight compared to the sedentary group, despite no observed changes in food intake. Furthermore, a distinct negative time lag was identified between the daily dynamics of NEPA and BT following vigorous exercise. A positive correlation was observed between plasma corticosterone levels and changes in NEPA before and after exercise across all exercise groups. Our findings provide evidence for vigorous exercise-specific reduction in NEPA, BT, and their synchrony, likely due to the disturbed circadian rhythm of corticosterone. Declined BT could imply lowered thermogenesis, providing novel insights into the role of exercise intensity in influencing the weight loss effects of exercise.\nMulti-attribute decision-making in macaques relies on direct attribute comparisons\nAuthors: Perkins, A. Q.; Gillis, Z. S.; Rich, E. L.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.22.563329\nIn value-based decisions, there are frequently multiple attributes, such as cost, quality, or quantity, that contribute to the overall goodness of an option. Since one option may not be better in all attributes at once, the decision process should include a means of weighing relevant attributes. Most decision-making models solve this problem by computing an integrated value, or utility, for each option from a weighted combination of attributes. However, behavioral anomalies in decision-making, such as context effects, indicate that other attribute-specific computations might be taking place. Here, we tested whether rhesus macaques show evidence of attribute-specific processing in a value-based decision-making task. Monkeys made a series of decisions involving choice options comprising a sweetness and probability attribute. Each attribute was represented by a separate bar with one of two mappings between bar size and the magnitude of the attribute (i.e., bigger=better or bigger=worse). We found that translating across different mappings produced selective impairments in decision-making. When like attributes differed, monkeys were prevented from easily making direct attribute comparisons, and choices were less accurate and preferences were more variable. This was not the case when mappings of unalike attributes within the same option were different. Likewise, gaze patterns favored transitions between like attributes over transitions between unalike attributes of the same option, so that like attributes were sampled sequentially to support within-attribute comparisons. Together, these data demonstrate that value-based decisions rely, at least in part, on directly comparing like attributes of multi-attribute options. Significance StatementValue-based decision-making is a cognitive function impacted by a number of clinical conditions, including substance use disorder and mood disorders. Understanding the neural mechanisms, including online processing steps involved in decision formation, will provide critical insights into decision-making deficits characteristic of human psychiatric disorders. Using rhesus monkeys as a model species capable of complex decision-making, this study shows that decisions involve a process of comparing like features, or attributes, of multi-attribute options. This is contrary to popular models of decision-making in which attributes are first combined into an overall value, or utility, to make a choice. Therefore, these results serve as an important foundation for establishing a more complete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in forming complex decisions.\nA state with increased arousal threshold in Araneus diadematus (Araneidae) measured in the wild: new evidence for sleep in spiders\nAuthors: Rössler, D. C.; Herberstein, M. E.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563109\nSleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.\nAnimal Emotions and Consciousness: Researchers' Perceptions, Biases, and Prospects for Future Progress\nAuthors: Zipple, M.

Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an \"internal world\" to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (\u003e85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work. Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

It is critical to uncover relationships between ambient weather, parental behaviors, and offspring thermal environments to understand the ability of organisms to mitigate environmental conditions and predict outcomes under climate change. In warm conditions, avian parents may spend longer periods away from the nest, but we know little of how increased thermal variation drives these changes or what temporal scale influences the changes. We examined how parents mediate environmental conditions for developing offspring in two quail species, Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginiatus), by examining changes in the duration and timing of incubation off-bouts (recesses away from the nest) in relation to mean temperature and temperature variability experienced over either a 24-hour period (low resolution) or in the two hours immediately preceding an off-bout (high resolution). We found species-specific differences in off-bout duration, with Scaled Quail spending a significantly shorter time off the nest daily. In both species, we detected a positive relationship between average thermal conditions and the start time of afternoon off-bouts. Alternatively, morning off-bouts occur earlier in response to increased thermal variation from the previous day. Warm conditions immediately preceding off-bouts led to increased off-bout duration with the opposite trend in response to increased variation. Our findings suggest that the thermal environment, in contrasting ways over varying thermal and temporal scales, can have a significant impact on parental care behaviors. These alterations can lead to altered thermal environments for offspring across multiple scales. Therefore, determining how the thermal environment induces behavioral changes requires high-resolution environmental data.\nRole of Dopamine Neurons in Familiarity\nAuthors: Fleury, S.; Kolaric, R.; Espera, J. J.; Ha, Q.; Tomaio, J. N.; Gether, U.; Sorensen, A. T.; Mingote, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.25.564006\nDopamine neurons signal the salience of environmental stimuli, influencing learning and motivation. However, research has not yet identified whether dopamine neurons also modulate the salience of memory content. Dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) increases in response to novel objects and diminishes as objects become familiar through repeated presentations. We proposed that the declined rate of dopamine neuron activity during familiarization affects the salience of a familiar objects memory. This, in turn, influences the degree to which an animal distinguishes between familiar and novel objects in a subsequent novel object recognition (NOR) test. As such, a single familiarization session may not sufficiently reduce dopamine activity, allowing the memory of a familiar object to maintain its salience and potentially attenuating NOR. In contrast, multiple familiarization sessions could lead to more pronounced dopamine activity suppression, strengthening NOR. Our data in mice reveals that, compared to a single session, multiple sessions result in decreased VTA dopamine neuron activation, as indicated by c-Fos measurements, and enhanced novelty discrimination. Critically, when VTA dopamine neurons are chemogenetically inhibited during a single familiarization session, NOR improves, mirroring the effects of multiple familiarization sessions. In summary, our findings highlight the pivotal function of dopamine neurons in familiarity and suggest a role in modulating the salience of memory content.\nBehavioral and genetic correlates of heterogeneity in learning performance in individual honeybees, Apis mellifera\nAuthors: Menzel, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563551\nLearning an olfactory discrimination task leads to heterogeneous results in honeybees with bees performing very well and others at low rates. Here we investigated this behavioral heterogeneity and asked whether it is associated with particular gene expression patterns. Bees were individually conditioned in a sequential conditioning protocol involving several phases of olfactory learning and retention tests. The rate of CS+ odor learning was found to correlate highest with a cumulative performance score extracted from all learning and retention tests. The cumulative score was used to sort the tested bees into high and low performers. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the mushroom body area of the brains of these bees disclosed a list of genes, which were differentially expressed between the high and low performers. These candidate genes are implicated in diverse biological functions, such as neurotransmission, memory formation, cargo trafficking and development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Prey-predator interactions have resulted in the evolution of many anti-predatory traits. One of them is the ability for prey to listen to predators and avoid them. Although prey anti-predatory behavioural responses to predator auditory cues are well described in a wide range of taxa, studies on whether butterflies change their behaviours in response to their predatory calls are lacking. Heliconius butterflies are unpalatable and form Mullerian mimicry rings as morphological defence strategies against their bird predators. Like many other butterflies in the Nymphalidae family, Heliconius butterflies possess auditory organs, which are hypothesized to have evolved to assist with predator detection. Here we test whether Heliconius melpomene change their behaviour in response to their predatory bird calls by observing the behaviour of male and female H. m. plessini exposed to calls of Heliconius avian predators: rufous-tailed jacamar, migratory Eastern kingbird, and resident tropical kingbird. We also exposed them to the calls of the toco toucan, a frugivorous bird as a control bird call, and an amplified greenhouse background noise as a noise control. We found that individuals changed their behaviour in response to jacamar calls only. Males increased their walking and fluttering behaviour, while females did not change their behaviour during the playback of the jacamar call. Intersexual behaviours like courtship, copulation, and abdomen lifting did not change in response to bird calls. Our findings suggest that despite having primary predatory defences like toxicity and being in a mimicry ring, H. m. plessini butterflies changed their behaviour in response to predator calls. Furthermore, this response was predator specific, as H. m. plesseni did not respond to either the Eastern kingbird or the tropic kingbird calls. This suggests that Heliconius butterflies may be able to differentiate predatory calls, and potentially the birds associated with those calls.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of wild-type mice germ free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The diet of large carnivores is of great interest to conservation managers, as it can reveal the extent of human-carnivore conflict and the impact of carnivores on species of high conservation priority. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA can identify species and is often more reliable in doing so than observational or morphological methods. Metabarcoding is particularly powerful at detecting elusive and rare species and has therefore become a widely applied tool in biodiversity research. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to determine the diet of spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro Crater, a protected area in Northern Tanzania surrounded by areas co-inhabited by pastoralists. We assessed which species hyenas preferably consumed over a 24-year period and how frequently they consumed pastoralist livestock and black rhinoceros, a species of high economic value and conservation priority. We further estimated the effects of three key socio-demographic variables - age, social rank, and sex - on the propensity of hyenas to consume livestock. We detected DNA from 20 species in 371 hyena feces. Hyenas preferably consumed blue wildebeest and Grants gazelle. Among the detected species were five domestic species and one wild species that lived in the pastoralist-inhabited areas but not the Crater. This shows that resident Crater hyenas undertake foraging trips to areas surrounding the Crater. DNA of domestic species however was rarely detected (4.1% of 434 detections), and predominantly in feces of old hyenas. This suggests that Crater hyenas rarely consume livestock and that livestock is mostly consumed by hyenas less capable of hunting fleet-footed and powerful wild prey. No DNA of black rhinoceros was detected in any of the samples, suggesting that Crater hyenas do not frequently consume rhinoceros. Our findings suggest that the impact of Crater hyenas on livestock and wildlife of high conservation priority is limited. Our study highlights the potential of DNA metabarcoding to assess the extent of human-carnivore conflict and to guide evidence-based conservation efforts to promote coexistence of carnivores, humans and species of high conservation priority.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exercise benefits the body and mind, but its weight loss effect is less than generally expected. Although this phenomenon is likely due to a decrease in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and thermogenesis following exercise, the underlying mechanisms and effects of exercise intensity remain unknown. Here we show the potential role of corticosterone dynamics in the decline in NEPA and thermogenesis following vigorous exercise. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were categorized into three groups: sedentary, moderate exercise, and vigorous exercise, with exercise groups undergoing a 30 min treadmill session. Using an intraperitoneally implanted activity monitor, NEPA and body temperature (BT) were monitored for two days before and three days after exercise. The daily synchrony between the NEPA and BT was evaluated using a cross-correlation function. Plasma corticosterone was also detected at 6 and 24 h after exercise. Notably, only the vigorous exercise group exhibited a decline in both NEPA and BT, and increased body weight compared to the sedentary group, despite no observed changes in food intake. Furthermore, a distinct negative time lag was identified between the daily dynamics of NEPA and BT following vigorous exercise. A positive correlation was observed between plasma corticosterone levels and changes in NEPA before and after exercise across all exercise groups. Our findings provide evidence for vigorous exercise-specific reduction in NEPA, BT, and their synchrony, likely due to the disturbed circadian rhythm of corticosterone. Declined BT could imply lowered thermogenesis, providing novel insights into the role of exercise intensity in influencing the weight loss effects of exercise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In value-based decisions, there are frequently multiple attributes, such as cost, quality, or quantity, that contribute to the overall goodness of an option. Since one option may not be better in all attributes at once, the decision process should include a means of weighing relevant attributes. Most decision-making models solve this problem by computing an integrated value, or utility, for each option from a weighted combination of attributes. However, behavioral anomalies in decision-making, such as context effects, indicate that other attribute-specific computations might be taking place. Here, we tested whether rhesus macaques show evidence of attribute-specific processing in a value-based decision-making task. Monkeys made a series of decisions involving choice options comprising a sweetness and probability attribute. Each attribute was represented by a separate bar with one of two mappings between bar size and the magnitude of the attribute (i.e., bigger=better or bigger=worse). We found that translating across different mappings produced selective impairments in decision-making. When like attributes differed, monkeys were prevented from easily making direct attribute comparisons, and choices were less accurate and preferences were more variable. This was not the case when mappings of unalike attributes within the same option were different. Likewise, gaze patterns favored transitions between like attributes over transitions between unalike attributes of the same option, so that like attributes were sampled sequentially to support within-attribute comparisons. Together, these data demonstrate that value-based decisions rely, at least in part, on directly comparing like attributes of multi-attribute options.

Significance StatementValue-based decision-making is a cognitive function impacted by a number of clinical conditions, including substance use disorder and mood disorders. Understanding the neural mechanisms, including online processing steps involved in decision formation, will provide critical insights into decision-making deficits characteristic of human psychiatric disorders. Using rhesus monkeys as a model species capable of complex decision-making, this study shows that decisions involve a process of comparing like features, or attributes, of multi-attribute options. This is contrary to popular models of decision-making in which attributes are first combined into an overall value, or utility, to make a choice. Therefore, these results serve as an important foundation for establishing a more complete understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in forming complex decisions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Do animals have emotions? Scientists and philosophers have long struggled with this question, with debates ranging from whether animals experience an &#34;internal world&#34; to whether we are capable of studying it. Recently, theoretical, and methodological advances have rekindled this debate, yet, it is unclear where the scientific consensus on these topics lies today. To address this gap, we administered a survey of professional animal behavior researchers to assess perceptions regarding (1) the taxonomic distribution of emotions and consciousness in non-human animals, (2) respondents confidence in this assessment, and (3) attitudes towards potential for progress and possible pitfalls when addressing these questions. In general, animal behavior researchers (n=100) ascribed emotionality and consciousness to a broad swath of the animal taxa, including non-human primates, other mammals, birds, and cephalopods, with varying degrees of confidence. There was a strong positive relationship between how likely a respondent was to attribute emotions to a given taxa and their confidence in that assessment, with respondents assuming an absence of emotions and consciousness when they were unsure. In addition, respondents assessments were shaped by several traits (e.g., advanced cognitive abilities, consciousness) that they also admitted were not necessary for an animal to experience emotions. Ultimately, a large majority of researchers were optimistic that tools either currently exist or will exist in the future to rigorously address these questions (&gt;85%) and that animal behavior, as a field, should do more to encourage emotions research (71%). We discuss implications of our findings for publication bias, ethical considerations, and identify an emergent consensus for the need of a functional definition of emotions to facilitate future work.

Significance StatementEmotions and consciousness are fundamental components of human experience--these phenomena are central to our behavior, relationships, and sense of meaning. Whether these experiences are shared by non-human animals has long been a subject of philosophical and scientific debate. In this paper we describe, for the first time, results from a survey of animal behavior researchers regarding their perceptions of these questions and the ability of science to answer them. Researchers ascribe emotions and consciousness to many taxa, and their likelihood of doing was strongly predicted by phylogeny and researchers confidence in their answers. We hope these results spur additional interdisciplinary collaboration to rigorously pursue these questions and create a baseline for future comparisons to track scientific attitudes over time.

        <p class="abstract">Environmental conditions can influence parental care behaviors, which in turn can greatly affect the microhabitat conditions experienced by developing offspring. It is critical to uncover relationships between ambient weather, parental behaviors, and offspring thermal environments to understand the ability of organisms to mitigate environmental conditions and predict outcomes under climate change. In warm conditions, avian parents may spend longer periods away from the nest, but we know little of how increased thermal variation drives these changes or what temporal scale influences the changes. We examined how parents mediate environmental conditions for developing offspring in two quail species, Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata) and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginiatus), by examining changes in the duration and timing of incubation off-bouts (recesses away from the nest) in relation to mean temperature and temperature variability experienced over either a 24-hour period (low resolution) or in the two hours immediately preceding an off-bout (high resolution). We found species-specific differences in off-bout duration, with Scaled Quail spending a significantly shorter time off the nest daily. In both species, we detected a positive relationship between average thermal conditions and the start time of afternoon off-bouts. Alternatively, morning off-bouts occur earlier in response to increased thermal variation from the previous day. Warm conditions immediately preceding off-bouts led to increased off-bout duration with the opposite trend in response to increased variation. Our findings suggest that the thermal environment, in contrasting ways over varying thermal and temporal scales, can have a significant impact on parental care behaviors. These alterations can lead to altered thermal environments for offspring across multiple scales. Therefore, determining how the thermal environment induces behavioral changes requires high-resolution environmental data.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dopamine neurons signal the salience of environmental stimuli, influencing learning and motivation. However, research has not yet identified whether dopamine neurons also modulate the salience of memory content. Dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) increases in response to novel objects and diminishes as objects become familiar through repeated presentations. We proposed that the declined rate of dopamine neuron activity during familiarization affects the salience of a familiar objects memory. This, in turn, influences the degree to which an animal distinguishes between familiar and novel objects in a subsequent novel object recognition (NOR) test. As such, a single familiarization session may not sufficiently reduce dopamine activity, allowing the memory of a familiar object to maintain its salience and potentially attenuating NOR. In contrast, multiple familiarization sessions could lead to more pronounced dopamine activity suppression, strengthening NOR. Our data in mice reveals that, compared to a single session, multiple sessions result in decreased VTA dopamine neuron activation, as indicated by c-Fos measurements, and enhanced novelty discrimination. Critically, when VTA dopamine neurons are chemogenetically inhibited during a single familiarization session, NOR improves, mirroring the effects of multiple familiarization sessions. In summary, our findings highlight the pivotal function of dopamine neurons in familiarity and suggest a role in modulating the salience of memory content.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Learning an olfactory discrimination task leads to heterogeneous results in honeybees with bees performing very well and others at low rates. Here we investigated this behavioral heterogeneity and asked whether it is associated with particular gene expression patterns. Bees were individually conditioned in a sequential conditioning protocol involving several phases of olfactory learning and retention tests. The rate of CS&#43; odor learning was found to correlate highest with a cumulative performance score extracted from all learning and retention tests. The cumulative score was used to sort the tested bees into high and low performers. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the mushroom body area of the brains of these bees disclosed a list of genes, which were differentially expressed between the high and low performers. These candidate genes are implicated in diverse biological functions, such as neurotransmission, memory formation, cargo trafficking and development.</p>
