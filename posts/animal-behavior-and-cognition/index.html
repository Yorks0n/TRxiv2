Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.\nConditioned overconsumption is dependent on reinforcer type in lean, but not obese, mice.\nAuthors: Lewis-Sanders, D.; Bullich, S.; Olvera, M. J.; Vo, J.; Hwang, Y.-S.; Stern, S. A.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573797\nAssociative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.\nHigh Resolution Outdoor Videography of Insects Using Fast Lock-On Tracking\nAuthors: Vo-Doan, T. T.; Titov, V. V.; Harrap, M. J.; Lochner, S.; Straw, A. D.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-12-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572558\nInsects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings. One-Sentence SummaryFast Lock-On tracking enables recording trajectories and high-speed videos of insects behaving over large areas in the wild.\nAnts hold a grudge: Associative learning of non-nestmate cues improves enemy recognition\nAuthors: Bey, M.; Endermann, R.; Raudies, C.; Steinle, J.; Nehring, V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572127\nRecognition protects biological systems of all scales, from cells to societies. Social insects recognize their nestmates by colony-specific chemical labels, which individuals store as \"templates\" in their memories. The distributed model of nestmate recognition predicts that individual experiences cause variation between the recognition templates that different individuals store in their memory. Here, we show for the first time that ants associatively learn recognition labels of both friends and enemies during brief encounters. Because different individuals will accumulate different experiences throughout their lives, their later decisions on whether to accept or reject other individuals will also vary. Individual associative learning can thus explain many phenomena from nasty neighbour effects to age polyethism. To avoid chaos caused by inconsistent decisions across individuals, decisions are made in a distributed manner at the colony level. Group-level decision can thus be much more accurate than any individual decision alone.\nPose analysis in free-swimming adult zebrafish, Danio rerio:\"fishy\" origins of movement design\nAuthors: Kanwal, J. S.; Sanghera, B.; Dabbi, R.; Glasgow, E.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573780\nMovement requires maneuvers that generate thrust to either make turns or move the body forward in physical space. The computational space for perpetually controlling the relative position of every point on the body surface can be vast. We hypothesize the evolution of efficient design for movement that minimizes active (neural) control by leveraging the passive (reactive) forces between the body and the surrounding medium at play. To test our hypothesis, we investigate the presence of stereotypical postures during free-swimming in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. We perform markerless tracking using DeepLabCut, a deep learning pose estimation toolkit, to track geometric relationships between body parts. To identify putative clusters of postural configurations obtained from twelve freely behaving zebrafish, we use unsupervised multivariate time-series analysis (B-SOiD machine learning software). When applied to single individuals, this method reveals a best-fit for 36 to 50 clusters in contrast 86 clusters for data pooled from all 12 animals. The centroids of each cluster obtained over 14,000 sequential frames recorded for a single fish represent an apriori classification into relatively stable \"target body postures\" and inter-pose \"transitional postures\" that lead to and away from a target pose. We use multidimensional scaling of mean parameter values for each cluster to map cluster-centroids within two dimensions of postural space. From a post-priori visual analysis, we condense neighboring postural variants into 15 superclusters or core body configurations. We develop a nomenclature specifying the anteroposterior level/s (upper, mid and lower) and degree of bending. Our results suggest that constraining bends to mainly three levels in adult zebrafish preempts the neck, fore- and hindlimb design for maneuverability in land vertebrates.\nReinforcement Expectation in the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera): Downshifts in Reinforcement Show Conditioned Inhibition\nAuthors: Mahoney, S.; Hosler, J.; Smith, B. H. H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574098\nWhen animals learn the association of a Conditioned Stimulus with an Unconditioned Stimulus, later presentation of the CS invokes a representation of the US. When the expected US fails to occur, theoretical accounts predict that conditioned inhibition can accrue to any other stimuli that are associated with this change in the US. Empirical work with mammals has confirmed the existence of conditioned inhibition. But the way it is manifested, the conditions that produce it, and determining whether it is the opposite of excitatory conditioning, are important considerations. Invertebrates can make valuable contributions to this literature because of the well-established conditioning protocols and access to the central nervous system for studying neural underpinnings of behavior. Nevertheless, conditioned inhibition has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in invertebrates. Here we evaluate the role of the unconditioned stimulus (US) in producing conditioned inhibition by using Proboscis Extension Response conditioning of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Specifically, using variations of a feature-negative experimental design, we employ downshifts in US intensity relative to US intensity used during initial excitatory conditioning, to show that an odorant in an odor-odor mixture can become a conditioned inhibitor. We argue that alternative interpretations to conditioned inhibition are unlikely. However, we show variation across individuals in how strongly they show Conditioned Inhibition, with some individuals possibly revealing a different means of learning about changes in reinforcement. We discuss how more work can reveal more details of conditioned inhibition, how it can be extended to investigate how it is encoded in the CNS, and how the work can generalize to other insect models. On particular, work like this will be important as more is revealed of the complexity of the insect brain from connectome projects.\nDoes novelty influence foraging decision of a scavenger?\nAuthors: Bhattacharjee, D.; Sau, S.; Das, J.; Bhadra, A.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571372\nAcquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.\nInvariant crossmodal equivalence between objects in rhesus monkeys\nAuthors: Cabrera-Ruiz, E.; Alva, M.; Mata, M.; Trevino, M.; Vergara, J.; Figueroa, T.; Perez-Orive, J.; Lemus, L.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574397\nAfter hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys' choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.\nDeepRod: A human-in-the-loop system for automatic rodent behavior analysis\nAuthors: Loy, A.; Garafolj, M.; Schauerte, H.; Behnke, H.; Charnier, C.; Schwarz, P.; Rast, G.; Wollmann, T.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.572506\nWe present a human-in-the-loop system for efficient rodent behavior analysis in drug development.

E.; Tinsley, C. E.; Kaiser, M. E.; Lim, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574112\nEarly life sleep is important for neuronal development and maturation. Using the highly social prairie vole rodent model, we have previously reported that early-life sleep disruption (ELSD) during the pre-weaning period postnatal day (P)14 to 21 results in adult interference with social bonding and increases ethanol consumption following a stressor. Furthermore, we have reported increased parvalbumin expression and reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission in cortical regions in adult prairie voles that experienced this paradigm. To understand the impact of ELSD on the lifespan, examination of an earlier time in life is necessary. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the behavioral outcomes of ELSD on adolescent prairie voles. Here we hypothesized that anxiety and reward related behaviors, as measured by light/dark box, 2-bottle choice and social interactions, would be negatively impacted by ELSD in adolescent male and female prairie voles. Male ELSD voles were no different from control voles in measures of anxiety and ethanol preference or consumption, but affiliative social interactions were significantly reduced. ELSD differentially impacted female prairie voles, with increased anxiety-like behavior and reductions in ethanol consumption compared to Controls, but no impact on ethanol preference or social interactions. Together, these results suggest both male and female prairie voles experience differential changes to reward seeking behaviors, but only female prairie voles showed increases in anxiety-like behavior. These results further suggest that early-life sleep is critically important for neurotypical behaviors in adolescence, a time where reward-seeking and risky behaviors are adaptive for learning and promoting survival.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The fruit fly Drosophila is a major discovery platform in the biology of ageing due to its balance of relatively short lifespan and relatively complex physiology and behaviour. Previous studies have suggested that some important phenotypes of ageing, for instance increasingly fragmented sleep, are shared from humans to Drosophila and can be useful measures of behavioural change with age: these phenotypes therefore hold potential as readouts of healthy ageing for genetic or pharmacological interventions aimed at the underpinning biology of ageing. However, some age-related phenotypes in Drosophila show differing results among studies, leading to questions regarding the source of discrepancies among experiments. In this study, I have tested females and males from three common laboratory strains of Drosophila to determine the extent to which sex and background strain influence age-related behavioural changes in sleep and activity patterns. Surprisingly, I find that some phenotypes - including age-related changes in total activity, total sleep, and sleep fragmentation - depend strongly on sex and strain, to the extent that some phenotypes show opposing age-related changes in different sexes or strains. Conversely, I identify other phenotypes, including age-related decreases in morning and evening anticipation, that are more uniform across sexes and strains. These results reinforce the importance of controlling for background strain in both behavioural and ageing experiments, and they imply that caution should be used when drawing conclusions from studies on a single sex or strain of Drosophila. At the same time, these findings also offer suggestions for behavioural measures that merit further investigation as potentially more consistent phenotypes of ageing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Associative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects have significant global impacts on ecology, economy, and health and yet our understanding of their behavior remains limited. Bees, for example, use vision and a tiny brain to find flowers and return home, but understanding how they perform these impressive tasks has been hampered by limitations in recording technology. Here we present Fast Lock-On (FLO) tracking. This method moves an image sensor to remain focused on a retroreflective marker affixed to an insect. Using paraxial infrared illumination, simple image processing can localize the sensor location of the insect in a few milliseconds. When coupled with a feedback system to steer a high magnification optical system to remain focused on the insect, a high spatial-temporal resolution trajectory can be gathered over a large region. As the basis for several robotic systems, we show FLO is a versatile idea which can be employed in combination with other components. We demonstrate that the optical path can be split and used for recording high-speed video. Furthermore, by flying a FLO system on a quadcopter drone, we track a flying honey bee and anticipate tracking insects in the wild over kilometer scales. Such systems have the capability of providing higher resolution information about insects behaving in natural environments and as such will be helpful in revealing the biomechanical and neuroethological mechanisms used by insects in natural settings.

One-Sentence SummaryFast Lock-On tracking enables recording trajectories and high-speed videos of insects behaving over large areas in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recognition protects biological systems of all scales, from cells to societies. Social insects recognize their nestmates by colony-specific chemical labels, which individuals store as &#34;templates&#34; in their memories. The distributed model of nestmate recognition predicts that individual experiences cause variation between the recognition templates that different individuals store in their memory. Here, we show for the first time that ants associatively learn recognition labels of both friends and enemies during brief encounters. Because different individuals will accumulate different experiences throughout their lives, their later decisions on whether to accept or reject other individuals will also vary. Individual associative learning can thus explain many phenomena from nasty neighbour effects to age polyethism. To avoid chaos caused by inconsistent decisions across individuals, decisions are made in a distributed manner at the colony level. Group-level decision can thus be much more accurate than any individual decision alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Movement requires maneuvers that generate thrust to either make turns or move the body forward in physical space. The computational space for perpetually controlling the relative position of every point on the body surface can be vast. We hypothesize the evolution of efficient design for movement that minimizes active (neural) control by leveraging the passive (reactive) forces between the body and the surrounding medium at play. To test our hypothesis, we investigate the presence of stereotypical postures during free-swimming in adult zebrafish, Danio rerio. We perform markerless tracking using DeepLabCut, a deep learning pose estimation toolkit, to track geometric relationships between body parts. To identify putative clusters of postural configurations obtained from twelve freely behaving zebrafish, we use unsupervised multivariate time-series analysis (B-SOiD machine learning software). When applied to single individuals, this method reveals a best-fit for 36 to 50 clusters in contrast 86 clusters for data pooled from all 12 animals. The centroids of each cluster obtained over 14,000 sequential frames recorded for a single fish represent an apriori classification into relatively stable &#34;target body postures&#34; and inter-pose &#34;transitional postures&#34; that lead to and away from a target pose. We use multidimensional scaling of mean parameter values for each cluster to map cluster-centroids within two dimensions of postural space. From a post-priori visual analysis, we condense neighboring postural variants into 15 superclusters or core body configurations. We develop a nomenclature specifying the anteroposterior level/s (upper, mid and lower) and degree of bending. Our results suggest that constraining bends to mainly three levels in adult zebrafish preempts the neck, fore- and hindlimb design for maneuverability in land vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When animals learn the association of a Conditioned Stimulus with an Unconditioned Stimulus, later presentation of the CS invokes a representation of the US. When the expected US fails to occur, theoretical accounts predict that conditioned inhibition can accrue to any other stimuli that are associated with this change in the US. Empirical work with mammals has confirmed the existence of conditioned inhibition. But the way it is manifested, the conditions that produce it, and determining whether it is the opposite of excitatory conditioning, are important considerations. Invertebrates can make valuable contributions to this literature because of the well-established conditioning protocols and access to the central nervous system for studying neural underpinnings of behavior. Nevertheless, conditioned inhibition has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in invertebrates. Here we evaluate the role of the unconditioned stimulus (US) in producing conditioned inhibition by using Proboscis Extension Response conditioning of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Specifically, using variations of a  feature-negative experimental design, we employ downshifts in US intensity relative to US intensity used during initial excitatory conditioning, to show that an odorant in an odor-odor mixture can become a conditioned inhibitor. We argue that alternative interpretations to conditioned inhibition are unlikely. However, we show variation across individuals in how strongly they show Conditioned Inhibition, with some individuals possibly revealing a different means of learning about changes in reinforcement. We discuss how more work can reveal more details of conditioned inhibition, how it can be extended to investigate how it is encoded in the CNS, and how the work can generalize to other insect models. On particular, work like this will be important as more is revealed of the complexity of the insect brain from connectome projects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Acquiring knowledge about the environment is crucial for survival. Animals, often driven by their explorative tendencies, gather valuable information regarding food resources, shelter, mating partners, etc. While neophilia, or the preference for novel environmental stimuli or objects, can promote exploratory behaviour, neophobia, or avoidance of novel environmental stimuli, can constrain such behaviour. Neophobia can reduce predation risk, yet decreased exploratory behaviour resulting from it may limit the ability to discover potentially highly rewarding resources. Dogs (Canis familiaris) living in semi-urban and urban environments as free-ranging populations are, although subject to various selection forces, typically have negligible predation pressure. These dogs are scavengers in human-dominated environments; thus, selection against object-neophobia can provide benefits when searching for novel food resources. Although pet and captive pack-living dogs are known to exhibit neophilia when provided with novel objects, little is known about free-ranging dogs behavioural responses to novel objects, particularly in foraging contexts. Using an object choice experiment, we tested 274 free-ranging dogs from two age classes, adult and juvenile, to investigate their object-neophobia in a scavenging context. We employed a betweensubject study design, providing dogs with a familiar and a potentially novel object, both baited with equal but (partially)hidden food rewards. Adult and juvenile dogs significantly inspected the novel object first compared to the familiar one, even when we reduced the visual obscurity of the familiar object, i.e., when the hidden food reward was partially visible. Furthermore, novel objects with varying strengths of olfactory cues (baited vs. false-baited) were inspected comparably by adults and juveniles. No significant differences were found in the latencies to inspect the objects. These results indicate that free-ranging dogs, evidently from an early ontogenic phase, do not show object-neophobia, as demonstrated by their preference for novel over familiar food sources. We conclude that little to no constraint of neophobia on exploratory behaviour, yet selection for object-neophilia in semi-urban and urban-dwelling animals can guide foraging decision-making processes, providing adaptive benefits.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys&#39; choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early life sleep is important for neuronal development and maturation. Using the highly social prairie vole rodent model, we have previously reported that early-life sleep disruption (ELSD) during the pre-weaning period postnatal day (P)14 to 21 results in adult interference with social bonding and increases ethanol consumption following a stressor. Furthermore, we have reported increased parvalbumin expression and reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission in cortical regions in adult prairie voles that experienced this paradigm. To understand the impact of ELSD on the lifespan, examination of an earlier time in life is necessary. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the behavioral outcomes of ELSD on adolescent prairie voles. Here we hypothesized that anxiety and reward related behaviors, as measured by light/dark box, 2-bottle choice and social interactions, would be negatively impacted by ELSD in adolescent male and female prairie voles. Male ELSD voles were no different from control voles in measures of anxiety and ethanol preference or consumption, but affiliative social interactions were significantly reduced. ELSD differentially impacted female prairie voles, with increased anxiety-like behavior and reductions in ethanol consumption compared to Controls, but no impact on ethanol preference or social interactions. Together, these results suggest both male and female prairie voles experience differential changes to reward seeking behaviors, but only female prairie voles showed increases in anxiety-like behavior. These results further suggest that early-life sleep is critically important for neurotypical behaviors in adolescence, a time where reward-seeking and risky behaviors are adaptive for learning and promoting survival.</p>
