Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies' idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.\nA Framework for Fast, Large-scale, Semi-Automatic Inference of Animal Behavior from Monocular Videos\nAuthors: Price, E.; Khandelwal, P. C.; Rubenstein, D. I.; Ahmad, A.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551177\nAn automatic, quick, accurate, and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our methods workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grevys Zebras (Equus quagga and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior using our method.

S.; Messender, D.; Ferreira, S. T.; Lourenco, M. V.; Pandolfo, P.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.551984\nAbnormal cognitive and sensorial properties have been reported in patients with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic signaling and plasticity in brain areas related to cognitive and sensory processing. The spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR), in comparison to the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), is the most used genetic animal model to study ADHD. Brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical for midbrain and hippocampal dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation, is reduced in both ADHD subjects and SHR. Physical exercise (e.g. swimming) promotes neuroplasticity and improves cognition by increasing BDNF and irisin. Here we investigate the effects of gestational swimming on sensorial and behavioral phenotypes, striatal dopaminergic parameters, and hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and BDNF levels observed in WKY and SHR. Gestational swimming improved nociceptive reflex impairment in SHR rats and increased hippocampal BDNF levels in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent offspring. Sex differences were observed in hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels, with females presenting lower levels than males. Our results contribute to the notion that swimming during pregnancy is a promising alternative to improve ADHD phenotypes in the offspring.\nDifferences Between Human and Non-Human Primate Theory of Mind: Evidence from Computational Modeling\nAuthors: Berke, M.; Horschler, D.; Jara-Ettinger, J.; Santos, L.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551487\nCan non-human primates (NHPs) represent other minds? Answering this question has been historically difficult because primates can fail experimental tasks due to a lack of motivation, or succeed through simpler mechanisms. Here we introduce a computational approach for comparative cognition that enables us to quantitatively test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We formalized a collection of theories of NHP social cognition with varying representational complexity and compared them against data from classical NHP studies, focusing on the ability to determine what others know based on what they see. Our results uncovered that, while the most human-like models of NHP social cognition make perfect qualitative predictions, they predict effect sizes that are too strong to be plausible. Instead, theories of intermediate representational complexity best explained the data. At the same time, we show that it is possible for human-like models to capture non-human primate behavior (NHP), as long as we assume that NHPs rely on these representations only about one third of the time. These results show that, in visual perspective taking tasks, NHPs likely draw upon simpler social representations than humans, either in terms of representational complexity, or in terms of use.\nSocial flocking increases in harsh and challenging environments\nAuthors: Bellefeuille, J. J.; Ratnayake, R. C. B.; Cornthwaite, E.; Dakin, R.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551711\nGrouping with others can provide enhanced information about resources and threats. A key hypothesis in social evolution proposes that individuals can benefit from social information in environments where it is challenging to meet energetic needs. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining the environmental drivers of conspecific flocking behaviour in a large archive of citizen science observations of two common North American birds, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus). To quantify flocking behaviour, we apply the index of dispersion, D, as a metric of clumpiness in each species' spatiotemporal distribution. We show that juncos in winter are nearly always more clustered than a random expectation, whereas chickadees span a range from uniform to socially clustered distributions. In both species, the degree of social clustering strongly increases with abundance. We identify several key environmental variables that explain the extent of conspecific flocking in both species. Flocks are more socially clustered at higher latitudes, higher elevations, closer to midwinter, and at temperatures that are colder than average given the location and time of year. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that sociality is a key strategy for coping with harsh environments.\nRobust spatial self-organization in crowds of asynchronous pedestrians\nAuthors: Tomaru, T.; Nishiyama, Y.; Feliciani, C.; Murakami, H.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551584\nSimilar to other animal groups, human crowds exhibit a variety of self-organized collective behaviors. Spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes in bidirectional pedestrian flows is one of the most striking examples of self-organization in human crowds. In addition, previous experimental studies have suggested that stepping among pedestrians is spontaneously synchronized over time. However, those studies have primarily focused on one-dimensional, single-file crowds, limiting our understanding of temporal stepping patterns in crowds with more freedom of movement and their relationship to spatial patterns of organization. Here, we conducted experiments of bidirectional pedestrian flows (24 pedestrians in each group) and investigated the relationship between collective footsteps and self-organized lane formation by tracking each individual trajectory as well as foot-stepping kinematics. We found that, unlike previous studies, pedestrians did not spontaneously align their steps unless there was an external auditory cue to follow. Moreover, we found that footstep synchronization generated by external cues disturbed the flexibility of pedestrians' lateral movements, increased potential collision risks, and narrowed the formed lanes, suggesting structural instability in the spatial organization. These results imply that, without external cues, pedestrians marching out of step with each other can efficiently self-organize into robust structures. Understanding how asynchronous individuals contribute to ordered collective behavior has potential applications for promoting efficient crowd management and will inform theoretical models for human and other animal collective behavior with asynchronous positional updates.\nThe effect of information content distributions on word recollection and familiarity\nAuthors: Wallenberg, J. C.; Hinton, T. D.; Smulders, T. V.; Read, J. C. A.; Cuskley, C.; Fadhilah, S. N.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551617\nThis study builds on work on language processing and information theory which suggests that informationally uniform, or smoother, sequences are easier to process than ones in which information arrives in clumps. Because episodic memory is a form of memory in which information is encoded within its surrounding context, we predicted that episodic memory in particular would be sensitive to information distribution. We used the \"dual process\" theory of recognition memory to separate the episodic memory component (recollection) from the non-episodic component (familiarity) of recognition memory. Though we find a weak effect in the predicted direction, this does not reach statistical significance and so the study does not support the hypothesis. The study does replicate a known effect from the literature where low frequency words are more easily recognized than high frequency ones when participants employ recollection-type memory. We suggest our results may be explained by linguistic processing being particularly adapted to processing linear sequences of information in a way that episodic memory is not. Episodic memory likely evolved to deal with unpredictable, sometimes clumped, information streams.\nUnravelling vulture avoidance tactic of wind turbines combining empirical and simulation data\nAuthors: Sassi, Y.; Ziletti, N.; Duriez, O.; Robira, B.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550651\nThe increase of wind turbine installations to limit climate change may affect bird populations because of collisions with rotor blades. Birds may respond to wind turbine presence along a gradient of behavioural changes: avoiding the wind farm (macro-scale) or only the wind turbines either by anticipating wind turbine locations (meso-scale) or engaging into last-minute flee attempts after late perception (micro-scale). We investigated the flight response at these three spatial scales of 25 adult griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) equipped with GPS tags over three years when flying in an area including ten wind farms in the Causses, France. At macro-scale, the population foraging range and habitat use revealed that vultures did not avoid wind farms. To investigate avoidance at meso- and micro-scales we focused on the four mostly visited wind farms. We compared vulture flights to null movement models, based on a method allowing us to keep the correlation between flights and topography while creating movement independent of wind turbine locations. At most sites, vultures did not show avoidance behaviour. Yet, simulations from our agent-based model highlighted that the avoidance pattern detected at one wind farm matched with an anticipated avoidance of turbines, probably linked to the presence of a ridge nearby. Overall, our results suggest wind farm-specific responses by soaring birds as a function of the landscape topography. Thus, stakeholders should carefully consider the wind farm location for siting and designing preventive measures (e.g. improve detection of species not able to avoid turbines in switching off on-demand technologies) to reduce collision risk of soaring birds.\nSocial attention across development in common ravens and carrion crows\nAuthors: Miller (Harrison), R.; Boeckle, M.; Ridgway, S.; Richardson, J.; Uhl, F.; Bugnyar, T.; Schwab, C.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551806\nUnderlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head \u0026 body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone, C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of head \u0026 body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of other's presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.\nAn Integrated Platform for in vivo Electrophysiology in Spatial Cognition Experiments\nAuthors: Brea Guerrero, A.; Oijala, M.; Moseley, S. C.; Tang, T.; Fletcher, F.; Zheng, Y.; Sanchez, L. M.; Clark, B.; Mcnaughton, B.; Wilber, A. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-08-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551691\nSpatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available. Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform, `Maze' and `Stim Trigger'. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. 'Stim Trigger' permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies&#39; idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An automatic, quick, accurate, and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our methods workflow is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames. We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on aerial videos of plains and Grevys Zebras (Equus quagga and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior using our method. A video abstract of this paper is available here3.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abnormal cognitive and sensorial properties have been reported in patients with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD patients exhibit impaired dopaminergic signaling and plasticity in brain areas related to cognitive and sensory processing. The spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR), in comparison to the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY), is the most used genetic animal model to study ADHD. Brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), critical for midbrain and hippocampal dopaminergic neuron survival and differentiation, is reduced in both ADHD subjects and SHR. Physical exercise (e.g. swimming) promotes neuroplasticity and improves cognition by increasing BDNF and irisin. Here we investigate the effects of gestational swimming on sensorial and behavioral phenotypes, striatal dopaminergic parameters, and hippocampal FNDC5/irisin and BDNF levels observed in WKY and SHR. Gestational swimming improved nociceptive reflex impairment in SHR rats and increased hippocampal BDNF levels in a sex-dependent manner in adolescent offspring. Sex differences were observed in hippocampal FNDC5/irisin levels, with females presenting lower levels than males. Our results contribute to the notion that swimming during pregnancy is a promising alternative to improve ADHD phenotypes in the offspring.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Can non-human primates (NHPs) represent other minds? Answering this question has been historically difficult because primates can fail experimental tasks due to a lack of motivation, or succeed through simpler mechanisms. Here we introduce a computational approach for comparative cognition that enables us to quantitatively test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We formalized a collection of theories of NHP social cognition with varying representational complexity and compared them against data from classical NHP studies, focusing on the ability to determine what others know based on what they see. Our results uncovered that, while the most human-like models of NHP social cognition make perfect qualitative predictions, they predict effect sizes that are too strong to be plausible. Instead, theories of intermediate representational complexity best explained the data. At the same time, we show that it is possible for human-like models to capture non-human primate behavior (NHP), as long as we assume that NHPs rely on these representations only about one third of the time. These results show that, in visual perspective taking tasks, NHPs likely draw upon simpler social representations than humans, either in terms of representational complexity, or in terms of use.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Grouping with others can provide enhanced information about resources and threats. A key hypothesis in social evolution proposes that individuals can benefit from social information in environments where it is challenging to meet energetic needs. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining the environmental drivers of conspecific flocking behaviour in a large archive of citizen science observations of two common North American birds, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus). To quantify flocking behaviour, we apply the index of dispersion, D, as a metric of clumpiness in each species&#39; spatiotemporal distribution. We show that juncos in winter are nearly always more clustered than a random expectation, whereas chickadees span a range from uniform to socially clustered distributions. In both species, the degree of social clustering strongly increases with abundance. We identify several key environmental variables that explain the extent of conspecific flocking in both species. Flocks are more socially clustered at higher latitudes, higher elevations, closer to midwinter, and at temperatures that are colder than average given the location and time of year. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that sociality is a key strategy for coping with harsh environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Similar to other animal groups, human crowds exhibit a variety of self-organized collective behaviors. Spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes in bidirectional pedestrian flows is one of the most striking examples of self-organization in human crowds. In addition, previous experimental studies have suggested that stepping among pedestrians is spontaneously synchronized over time. However, those studies have primarily focused on one-dimensional, single-file crowds, limiting our understanding of temporal stepping patterns in crowds with more freedom of movement and their relationship to spatial patterns of organization. Here, we conducted experiments of bidirectional pedestrian flows (24 pedestrians in each group) and investigated the relationship between collective footsteps and self-organized lane formation by tracking each individual trajectory as well as foot-stepping kinematics. We found that, unlike previous studies, pedestrians did not spontaneously align their steps unless there was an external auditory cue to follow. Moreover, we found that footstep synchronization generated by external cues disturbed the flexibility of pedestrians&#39; lateral movements, increased potential collision risks, and narrowed the formed lanes, suggesting structural instability in the spatial organization. These results imply that, without external cues, pedestrians marching out of step with each other can efficiently self-organize into robust structures. Understanding how asynchronous individuals contribute to ordered collective behavior has potential applications for promoting efficient crowd management and will inform theoretical models for human and other animal collective behavior with asynchronous positional updates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study builds on work on language processing and information theory which suggests that informationally uniform, or smoother, sequences are easier to process than ones in which information arrives in clumps. Because episodic memory is a form of memory in which information is encoded within its surrounding context, we predicted that episodic memory in particular would be sensitive to information distribution. We used the &#34;dual process&#34; theory of recognition memory to separate the episodic memory component (recollection) from the non-episodic component (familiarity) of recognition memory. Though we find a weak effect in the predicted direction, this does not reach statistical significance and so the study does not support the hypothesis. The study does replicate a known effect from the literature where low frequency words are more easily recognized than high frequency ones when participants employ recollection-type memory. We suggest our results may be explained by linguistic processing being particularly adapted to processing linear sequences of information in a way that episodic memory is not. Episodic memory likely evolved to deal with unpredictable, sometimes clumped, information streams.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The increase of wind turbine installations to limit climate change may affect bird populations because of collisions with rotor blades. Birds may respond to wind turbine presence along a gradient of behavioural changes: avoiding the wind farm (macro-scale) or only the wind turbines either by anticipating wind turbine locations (meso-scale) or engaging into last-minute flee attempts after late perception (micro-scale). We investigated the flight response at these three spatial scales of 25 adult griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) equipped with GPS tags over three years when flying in an area including ten wind farms in the Causses, France. At macro-scale, the population foraging range and habitat use revealed that vultures did not avoid wind farms. To investigate avoidance at meso- and micro-scales we focused on the four mostly visited wind farms. We compared vulture flights to null movement models, based on a method allowing us to keep the correlation between flights and topography while creating movement independent of wind turbine locations. At most sites, vultures did not show avoidance behaviour. Yet, simulations from our agent-based model highlighted that the avoidance pattern detected at one wind farm matched with an anticipated avoidance of turbines, probably linked to the presence of a ridge nearby. Overall, our results suggest wind farm-specific responses by soaring birds as a function of the landscape topography. Thus, stakeholders should carefully consider the wind farm location for siting and designing preventive measures (e.g. improve detection of species not able to avoid turbines in switching off on-demand technologies) to reduce collision risk of soaring birds.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Underlying social learning and other important aspects of successful adaptation to social life is social awareness, where individuals are required to pay attention and respond flexibly to others in their environment. We tested the influence of social context (alone, affiliate, non-affiliate, heterospecific) on behavioural interactions (manipulation, caching, head &amp; body out of sight i.e. barrier use) with food and objects during development at fledging (1-2 months), juvenile (3-8 months) and sub-adult (14-18 months old) in 10 carrion crows (Corvus corone, C. cornix) and nine common ravens (C. corax). These species are closely related, generalist corvids and subjects were all hand-reared and housed in highly comparable conditions. Both species will routinely cache, i.e. hide food and other items for later recovery, and engage in cache-pilfering (stealing) strategies. They will interact and play with objects, potentially as part of developing social bonding and/or physical skills. We found that corvid behaviour was influenced by social context, with birds showing higher frequency of head &amp; body out of sight behaviour while others were observing than when alone, suggesting they have an awareness of other&#39;s presence and respond by using barriers when interacting with items. There were no differences based on observer identity, supporting an interpretation of item interaction and play potentially driving development of physical skills in this setting. There were developmental effects, including increased manipulation and use of barriers as juveniles as well as increased caching with age. Ravens generally cached more than crows. Objects were manipulated more frequently than food, while barriers were used more with food, indicating that food was more likely to be actively hidden while objects may promote open play. We discuss our findings in relation to other social and developmental influences on behaviour and the wider ramifications for identifying the drivers of play in animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatial cognition research requires behavioral paradigms that can distinguish between different navigational elements, such as allocentric (map-like) navigation and egocentric (e.g., body centered) navigation. To fill this need, we developed a flexible experimental platform that can be quickly modified without the need for significant changes to software and hardware. In this paper, we present this inexpensive and flexible behavioral platform paired with software which we are making freely available. Our behavioral platform serves as the foundation for a range of experiments, and though developed for assessing spatial cognition, it also has applications in the non-spatial domain of behavioral testing. There are two components of the software platform, `Maze&#39; and `Stim Trigger&#39;. Both programs can work in conjunction with electrophysiology acquisition systems, allowing for precise time stamping of neural events with behavior. The Maze program includes functionality for automatic reward delivery based on user defined zones. &#39;Stim Trigger&#39; permits control of brain stimulation via any equipment that can be paired with an Arduino board. We seek to share our software and leverage the potential by expanding functionality in the future to meet the needs of a larger community of researchers.</p>
