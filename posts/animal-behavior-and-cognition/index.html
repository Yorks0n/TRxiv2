In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nSociality shapes the life histories of animals along the fast-slow continuum, but does not affect their senescence\nAuthors: Salguero-Gomez, R.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.575897\nThe role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nBeyond a unitary construct: Dissecting stopping behaviour in two bird species\nAuthors: Troisi, C. A.; Vernouillet, A.; Allaert, R.; Knoch, S.; Martel, A.; Lens, L.; Verbruggen, F.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575695\nThe ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in going and stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.\nPregnancy-associated oxidative stress and inflammation are not associated with impaired maternal neuronal activity or memory function\nAuthors: Bradshaw, J. L.; Wilson, E. N.; Gardner, J. J.; Mabry, S.; Tucker, S. M.; Rybalchenko, N.; Vera, E.; Goulopoulou, S.; Cunningham, R. L.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577461\nPregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [\u0026le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [\u0026le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [\u0026le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.\nExploring the Categorical Nature of Colour Perception: Insights from Deep Networks\nAuthors: Akbarinia, A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577209\nThis study delves into the categorical aspects of colour perception, employing the odd-one-out paradigm on artificial neural networks. We reveal a significant alignment between human data and unimodal vision networks (e.g., ImageNet object recognition). Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP text-image matching) account for the remaining unexplained data even in non-linguistic experiments. These results suggest that categorical colour perception is a language-independent representation, albeit partly shaped by linguistic colour terms during its development. Exploring the ubiquity of colour categories in Taskonomy unimodal vision networks highlights the task-dependent nature of colour categories, predominantly in semantic and 3D tasks, with a notable absence in low-level tasks. To explain this difference, we analysed kernels' responses before the winner-taking-all, observing that networks with mismatching colour categories align in continuous representations. Our findings quantify the dual influence of visual signals and linguistic factors in categorical colour perception, thereby formalising a harmonious reconciliation of the universal and relative debates.\nWITHDRAWN: Behavioral sequences across multiple animal species in the wild share common structural features\nAuthors: Minasandra, P.; Grout, E. M.; Crofoot, M. C.; Demartsev, V.; Gersick, A. S.; Hirsch, B. T.; Holekamp, K. E.; Johnson-Ulrich, L.; Nayak, A.; Ortega, J.; Roch, M. A.; Strauss, E. D.; Strandburg-Peshkin, A.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.576411\nAnimal behavior can be decomposed into a continuous sequence of discrete activity bouts over time. Analyzing the statistical structure of such behavioral sequences provides insights into the drivers of behavioral decisions in animals. Laboratory studies, predominantly in invertebrates, have suggested that behavioral sequences are characterized by multiple timescales and exhibit long-range memory, but the extent to which these results can be generalized to other taxa and to animals living in natural settings remains unclear. By analyzing accelerometer-inferred predictions of behavioral states in three species of social mammals (meerkats, white-nosed coatis, and spotted hyenas) in the wild, we discovered surprisingly consistent structuring of behavioral sequences across all behavioral states, all individuals and all study species. Behavioral bouts were characterized by decreasing hazard functions, wherein the longer a behavioral bout had progressed, the less likely it was to end within the next instant. The distributions of bout durations were also heavy-tailed (typically power-law or truncated power-law), suggesting that bouts of behavior cannot be characterized by a typical duration for any of the behaviors we studied. Finally, the predictability of an animals future behavioral state as a function of its present state always decreased as a truncated power law for predictions made farther into the future, with very similar estimates for the power law exponent across all three species. These patterns suggest similar structural principles in behavioral sequences across all study species. Why such shared patterns emerge remains unknown. We explore multiple plausible explanations, including environmental non-stationarity, behavioral self-reinforcement via positive feedback, or a combination of multiple relevant timescales driven by the hierarchical nature of behavior. The existence of highly consistent patterns in behavioral sequences across all three study species suggests that these phenomena could be widespread in nature, and points to the existence of fundamental properties of behavioral dynamics that could drive such convergent patterns. Significance statementThe study of animal behavior seeks to understand how and why animals do what they do. This pursuit of general principles governing behavior across species can be approached by first understanding when animals choose to change their behavioral states (e.g., switching from walking to standing, or to running). Using accelerometer-inferred behaviors of three social mammals, we uncover common structural patterns in their sequences of behavior. We explore two explanations, involving either positive feedbacks or the interaction of several independent time-scales, about how such common patterns arise.\nArtificial Sweeteners in US-Marketed Oral Nicotine Pouch Products: Correlation with Nicotine Contents and Effects on Product Preference\nAuthors: Jabba, S. V.; Silinski, P.; Yang, A. Y.; Ouyang, W.; Jordt, S. E.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577472\nIntroduction: Artificial sweeteners are listed as ingredients of oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), a new product category with rapidly growing market share. The exact sweetener contents of ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior. Aims and Methods: Artificial sweetener contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Sweetener effects during the initiation of ONP consumption were modeled in single- and two-bottle tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type mice and mice deficient in the sweet taste receptor (Tas1r2-/-). Results: Acesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs (~0.3-0.9 mg/pouch), including products marketed as Unflavored or Flavor ban approved. In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (0.6-1.2 mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice. Conclusions: ONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners, with some brands adding more sweetener to ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitates consumption of ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Sweetness is a key determinant of ONP use initiation, likely reducing the aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents. Implications: Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and facilitate initiation and continued consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as Unflavored or Flavor ban-approved suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.\nAmelioration of age-related cognitive decline and anxiety in mice by Centella asiatica extract varies by sex, dose and mode of administration.\nAuthors: Gray, N. E.; Hack, W.; Brandes, M.; Zweig, J. A.; Yang, L.; Marney, L.; Choi, J.; Magana, A. A.; Cerruit, N.; McFerrin, J.; Koike, S.; Nguyen, T.; Raber, J.; Quinn, J. F.; Maier, C. S.; Soumyanath, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576700\nWe have previously reported that a water extract (CAW) of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica administered in drinking water can improve cognitive deficits in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we compared the effects of CAW administered in drinking water or the diet on cognition, measures of anxiety and depression-like behavior in healthy aged mice. Three- and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were administered rodent AIN-93M diet containing CAW (0, 0.2, 0.5 or 1% w/w) to provide 0, 200 mg/kg/d, 500 mg/kg/d or 1000 mg/kg/d for a total of 5 weeks. An additional group of eighteen-month-old mice were treated with CAW (10 mg/mL) in their drinking water for a total of five weeks to deliver the same exposure of CAW as the highest dietary dose (1000 mg/kg/d). CAW doses delivered were calculated based on food and water consumption measured in previous experiments. In the fourth and fifth weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing of cognition, anxiety and depression (n=12 of each sex per treatment group in each test). Aged mice of both sexes showed cognitive deficits relative to young mice while only female aged mice showed increased anxiety compared to the young female mice and no differences in depression were observed between the different ages. CAW (1000 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water improved deficits in aged mice in learning, executive function and recognition memory in both sexes and attenuated the increased measures of anxiety observed in the aged female mice. However, CAW in the diet only improved executive function in aged mice at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/d) in both sexes and did so less robustly than when given in the water. There were no effects of CAW on depression-like behavior in aged animals regardless of whether it was administered in the diet or the water. These results suggest that CAW can ameliorate age-related changes in measures of anxiety and cognition and that the mode of administration is important for the effects of CAW on resilience to these age-related changes.\nA neural correlate of learning fails to predict foraging efficiency in Bombus terrestris.\nAuthors: Pasquier, G.; Pull, C. D.; Ott, S. R.; Leadbeater, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576659\nThe mushroom bodies (MB) are integrative structures in the insect brain that, in social bees, contribute to both visual and olfactory learning. Changes in the density of presynaptic boutons (or microglomeruli) within the calyx region of the MB have been repeatedly linked to various aspects of foraging, including forms of learning that are thought to be key to support foraging efficiency. Here we set out to directly test the relationship between foraging efficiency and microglomerulus density in a bumblebee model, Bombus terrestris. We found no evidence that microglomerulus density predicted real-world foraging performance, nor any relationship with foraging experience. Instead, our data suggest a potential non-linear relationship between individual age, independent of foraging experience, and microglomerulus density in the lip region of the calyx, which is associated with olfactory processing. Our findings suggest that in real-world scenarios there is no simple direct relationship between microglomerular density, learning ability and foraging efficiency in bumblebees, highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the relationships between learning abilities, neuroanatomy and foraging efficiency.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of  going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of  stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in  going and  stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy is associated with neural and behavioral plasticity, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Yet, the impact of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress on maternal neural and behavioral plasticity during pregnancy are unclear. We hypothesized that the maternal hippocampal CA1, a brain region associated with cognition, would be protected from pregnancy-associated systemic elevations in inflammation and oxidative stress, mediating stable peripartum cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was tested using novel object recognition (recollective memory), Morris water maze (spatial memory), and open field (anxiety-like) behavior tasks in female Sprague-Dawley rats of varying reproductive states [non-pregnant (nulliparous), pregnant (near term), and two months post-pregnancy (primiparous); n = 7-8/group]. Plasma and CA1 proinflammatory cytokines were measured using a MILLIPLEX magnetic bead assay. Plasma oxidative stress was measured via advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) assay. CA1 markers of oxidative stress, neuronal activity, and apoptosis were quantified via western blotting. Our results demonstrate CA1 oxidative stress-associated markers were elevated in pregnant compared to nulliparous rats (p [&amp;le;] 0.017) but were equivalent levels in pregnant and primiparous rats. In contrast, reproductive state did not impact CA1 inflammatory cytokines, neuronal activity, or apoptosis. Likewise, there was no effect of reproductive state on recollective or spatial memory. Even so, spatial learning was impaired (p [&amp;le;] 0.007) while anxiety-like behavior (p [&amp;le;] 0.034) was reduced in primiparous rats. Overall, our data suggest maternal hippocampal CA1 is protected from systemic inflammation but vulnerable to peripartum oxidative stress. Thus, peripartum oxidative stress elevations, such as in pregnancy complications, may contribute to peripartum neural and behavioral plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study delves into the categorical aspects of colour perception, employing the odd-one-out paradigm on artificial neural networks. We reveal a significant alignment between human data and unimodal vision networks (e.g., ImageNet object recognition). Vision-language models (e.g., CLIP text-image matching) account for the remaining unexplained data even in non-linguistic experiments. These results suggest that categorical colour perception is a language-independent representation, albeit partly shaped by linguistic colour terms during its development. Exploring the ubiquity of colour categories in Taskonomy unimodal vision networks highlights the task-dependent nature of colour categories, predominantly in semantic and 3D tasks, with a notable absence in low-level tasks. To explain this difference, we analysed kernels&#39; responses before the winner-taking-all, observing that networks with mismatching colour categories align in continuous representations. Our findings quantify the dual influence of visual signals and linguistic factors in categorical colour perception, thereby formalising a harmonious reconciliation of the universal and relative debates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal behavior can be decomposed into a continuous sequence of discrete activity bouts over time. Analyzing the statistical structure of such behavioral sequences provides insights into the drivers of behavioral decisions in animals. Laboratory studies, predominantly in invertebrates, have suggested that behavioral sequences are characterized by multiple timescales and exhibit long-range memory, but the extent to which these results can be generalized to other taxa and to animals living in natural settings remains unclear. By analyzing accelerometer-inferred predictions of behavioral states in three species of social mammals (meerkats, white-nosed coatis, and spotted hyenas) in the wild, we discovered surprisingly consistent structuring of behavioral sequences across all behavioral states, all individuals and all study species. Behavioral bouts were characterized by decreasing hazard functions, wherein the longer a behavioral bout had progressed, the less likely it was to end within the next instant. The distributions of bout durations were also heavy-tailed (typically power-law or truncated power-law), suggesting that bouts of behavior cannot be characterized by a  typical duration for any of the behaviors we studied. Finally, the predictability of an animals future behavioral state as a function of its present state always decreased as a truncated power law for predictions made farther into the future, with very similar estimates for the power law exponent across all three species. These patterns suggest similar structural principles in behavioral sequences across all study species. Why such shared patterns emerge remains unknown. We explore multiple plausible explanations, including environmental non-stationarity, behavioral self-reinforcement via positive feedback, or a combination of multiple relevant timescales driven by the hierarchical nature of behavior. The existence of highly consistent patterns in behavioral sequences across all three study species suggests that these phenomena could be widespread in nature, and points to the existence of fundamental properties of behavioral dynamics that could drive such convergent patterns.

Significance statementThe study of animal behavior seeks to understand how and why animals do what they do. This pursuit of general principles governing behavior across species can be approached by first understanding when animals choose to change their behavioral states (e.g., switching from walking to standing, or to running). Using accelerometer-inferred behaviors of three social mammals, we uncover common structural patterns in their sequences of behavior. We explore two explanations, involving either positive feedbacks or the interaction of several independent time-scales, about how such common patterns arise.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: Artificial sweeteners are listed as ingredients of oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), a new product category with rapidly growing market share. The exact sweetener contents of ONPs remain unknown. Artificial sweeteners in ONPs may facilitate initiation and encourage consumption behavior. Aims and Methods: Artificial sweetener contents in major US-marketed ONP brands (Zyn, on!, Velo) were determined by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Sweetener effects during the initiation of ONP consumption were modeled in single- and two-bottle tests, offering mice ONP extracts calibrated to contain nicotine levels similar to saliva of people who use smokeless tobacco. To examine the contribution of sweet taste perception, consumption behavior was compared between wild-type mice and mice deficient in the sweet taste receptor (Tas1r2-/-). Results: Acesulfame-K was detected in on!, Zyn and Velo ONPs (~0.3-0.9 mg/pouch), including products marketed as Unflavored or Flavor ban approved. In Velo ONPs, sweetened with sucralose (0.6-1.2 mg/pouch), higher nicotine strength products contained higher sucralose levels. Tas1r2-/- mice consumed less ONP extracts than wild-type mice in both sexes. ONP extracts with both higher nicotine and sweetener strengths were tolerated by wild-type mice, but produced stronger aversion in Tas1r2-/- mice. Conclusions: ONPs contain significant amounts of artificial sweeteners, with some brands adding more sweetener to ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Artificial sweeteners, at levels present in ONPs, increase nicotine consumption. Increasing sweetener contents facilitates consumption of ONPs with higher nicotine strengths. Sweetness is a key determinant of ONP use initiation, likely reducing the aversive sensory effects of nicotine and other ONP constituents. Implications: Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame-K or sucralose reduce aversion and facilitate initiation and continued consumption of ONPs. The marketing of some artificially sweetened ONPs as Unflavored or Flavor ban-approved suggests that the tobacco industry rejects sweet taste as a determinant for the presence of a characterizing flavor. Sweetness as imparted by artificial sweeteners in tobacco products needs to be addressed by regulators as a component of a characterizing flavor, with the aim to reduce product appeal and initiation by never users, and especially youth attracted to sweet flavors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We have previously reported that a water extract (CAW) of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica administered in drinking water can improve cognitive deficits in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we compared the effects of CAW administered in drinking water or the diet on cognition, measures of anxiety and depression-like behavior in healthy aged mice. Three- and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were administered rodent AIN-93M diet containing CAW (0, 0.2, 0.5 or 1% w/w) to provide 0, 200 mg/kg/d, 500 mg/kg/d or 1000 mg/kg/d for a total of 5 weeks. An additional group of eighteen-month-old mice were treated with CAW (10 mg/mL) in their drinking water for a total of five weeks to deliver the same exposure of CAW as the highest dietary dose (1000 mg/kg/d). CAW doses delivered were calculated based on food and water consumption measured in previous experiments. In the fourth and fifth weeks, mice underwent behavioral testing of cognition, anxiety and depression (n=12 of each sex per treatment group in each test). Aged mice of both sexes showed cognitive deficits relative to young mice while only female aged mice showed increased anxiety compared to the young female mice and no differences in depression were observed between the different ages. CAW (1000 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water improved deficits in aged mice in learning, executive function and recognition memory in both sexes and attenuated the increased measures of anxiety observed in the aged female mice. However, CAW in the diet only improved executive function in aged mice at the highest dose (1000 mg/kg/d) in both sexes and did so less robustly than when given in the water. There were no effects of CAW on depression-like behavior in aged animals regardless of whether it was administered in the diet or the water. These results suggest that CAW can ameliorate age-related changes in measures of anxiety and cognition and that the mode of administration is important for the effects of CAW on resilience to these age-related changes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mushroom bodies (MB) are integrative structures in the insect brain that, in social bees, contribute to both visual and olfactory learning. Changes in the density of presynaptic boutons (or microglomeruli) within the calyx region of the MB have been repeatedly linked to various aspects of foraging, including forms of learning that are thought to be key to support foraging efficiency. Here we set out to directly test the relationship between foraging efficiency and microglomerulus density in a bumblebee model, Bombus terrestris. We found no evidence that microglomerulus density predicted real-world foraging performance, nor any relationship with foraging experience. Instead, our data suggest a potential non-linear relationship between individual age, independent of foraging experience, and microglomerulus density in the lip region of the calyx, which is associated with olfactory processing. Our findings suggest that in real-world scenarios there is no simple direct relationship between microglomerular density, learning ability and foraging efficiency in bumblebees, highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the relationships between learning abilities, neuroanatomy and foraging efficiency.</p>
