Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.\nBreeding alters females' social positions by changing dominance dynamics\nAuthors: Dehnen, T.; Nyaguthii, B.; Cherono, W.; Boogert, N. J.; Farine, D. R.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558583\nAgonistic and affiliative interactions with group members dictate individuals' access to resources, and investment in competing for resources is often traded off with other needs. For example, reproductive investment can reduce body condition and, thereby, an individual's ability to win future agonistic interactions. However, group members may also alter their behaviour towards reproductive individuals, such as becoming more or less aggressive. Here, we investigated the social consequences of reproduction in female vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, a plural breeder in which females disperse and are subordinate to males. We found opposing patterns for breeders' within- and between-sex dominance interactions from before to after breeding. Specifically, while breeding females became far less likely to win dominance interactions with non-breeding females after breeding than before breeding, they received considerably fewer male aggressions than non-breeding females after breeding. Using agent-based models, we then show that hierarchies inferred using the Percolation and Conductance method are robust to such variation in interaction rates, while other common methods may be prone to systematically overestimating or underestimating particular individuals' hierarchy positions. Our study highlights reproduction as a driver of dominance dynamics, and illustrates how the study of dominance may benefit from considering variation in interaction rates.\nAfrican elephants address one another with individually specific calls\nAuthors: Pardo, M. A.; Fristrup, K.; Lolchuragi, D. S.; Poole, J.; Granli, P.; Moss, C.; Douglas-Hamilton, I.; Wittemyer, G.\nScore: 133.7, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554872\nPersonal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.\nEvidence for individual vocal recognition in a pair bonding poison frog? Insights from no-choice and two-choice paradigms\nAuthors: Moss, J. B.; Podraza, M. E.; Fischer, E. K.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.558024\nIndividually distinctive vocalizations are widespread in nature, although the ability of receivers to discriminate these signals has only been studied through limited taxonomic and social lenses. Here we ask whether anuran advertisement calls, typically studied for their role in territory defense and mate attraction, facilitate recognition and preferential association with partners in a pair bonding poison frog. Combining no- and two-stimulus choice playback experiments, we evaluated behavioral and physiological responses of females to male acoustic stimuli. Virgin females oriented to and approached speakers broadcasting male calls independent of caller identity, implying that females are generally attracted to male acoustic stimuli outside the context of a pair bond. When pair bonded females were presented with calls of a mate and a stranger, they showed a slight preference for calls of their mate. Moreover, behavioral responses varied with breeding status: females with eggs were faster to approach stimuli and spent more time in the mate arm than females that were pair bonded but did not currently have eggs. Our study suggests a potential role for individual vocal recognition in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds in a poison frog and raises new questions about how acoustic signals are perceived in the context of monogamy and biparental care.\nA history of avoidance does not impact extinction learning in male rats\nAuthors: Lopez-Moraga, A.; Luyten, L.; Beckers, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558816\nPervasive avoidance is one of the central symptoms of all anxiety-related disorders. In treatment, avoidance behaviors are typically discouraged because they are assumed to maintain anxiety. Yet, it is not clear that engaging in avoidance is always detrimental. In this study, we used a platform-mediated avoidance task to investigate the influence of avoidance history on extinction learning in male rats. Our results show that having the opportunity to avoid during fear acquisition training has no marked effect on the extinction of auditory cued fear in a platform-mediated avoidance procedure that constitutes a realistic approach/avoidance conflict in male rats, regardless of whether avoidance was possible during extinction or not. This suggests that imposing a realistic cost on avoidance behavior prevents the adverse effects that avoidance has been claimed to have on extinction, but even then, avoidance does not appear to have clear positive effects on extinction learning nor on retention either\nDynamic vocal learning in adult marmoset monkeys\nAuthors: Phaniraj, N.; Wierucka, K.; Burkart, J. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559020\nWhile vocal learning is vital to language acquisition in children, adults continue to adjust their speech while adapting to different social environments in the form of social vocal accommodation (SVA). Even though adult and infant vocal learning seemingly differ in their properties, whether the mechanisms underlying them differ remains unknown. The complex structure of language creates a challenge in quantifying vocal changes during SVA. Consequently, animals with simpler vocal communication systems are powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying SVA. Here, we tracked acoustic changes in the vocalizations of adult common marmoset pairs, a highly vocal primate species known to show SVA, for up to 85 days after pairing with a new partner. We identified four properties of SVA in marmosets: (1) bidirectional learning, (2) exponential decrease in vocal distance with time, (3) sensitivity to initial vocal distance, and (4) dyadic acoustic feature synchrony. We developed a mathematical model that shows all four properties. The model suggests that marmosets continuously update the memory of their partners' vocalizations and modify their own vocalizations to match them, a dynamic form of vocal learning. The model provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying SVA in adult animals and how they might differ from infant vocal learning.\nIdentification of neuronal ensembles involved in remote fear memory extinction impairments\nAuthors: Tomaszewski, K. F.; Lukasiewicz, K.; Robacha, M.; Radwanska, K.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.17.558133\nRemote memory consolidation, extinction, and its impairments have been of interest to researchers for years, especially due to its clinical relevance in patients with emotional disorders, like PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), anxiety, and phobias. Its neuronal substrates are key elements to understand the persistent nature of remote memory and open a new perspective to novel therapeutic approaches for human fear-related disorders. While the majority of reports investigate the mechanisms and ensembles of recent fear memory extinction (hours to days following conditioning), only a few refer to the remote time point (i.e. weeks after conditioning), usually describing successful memory extinction. The neuronal correlates of impaired remote fear memory extinction were yet beyond the scope. Here we present selective impairment of contextual remote fear memory extinction in alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation-limited mice (T286A+/-). To map brain regions involved in this phenomenon, we applied screening of c-Fos expression, a neuroplasticity marker, across 23 brain areas following contextual fear conditioning and extinction of recent (1-day old) and remote (30-days old) fear memory in WT and T286A+/- mice. Following impaired remote fear memory extinction in T286A+/- mice, we found upregulated c-Fos expression in the entorhinal cortex (ENT), nucleus reuniens (RE), centromedial (CM), mediodorsal (MD), anterodorsal (AD) thalamic nuclei, and medial septum (MS), compared to WT animals performing normal remote fear memory extinction. Thus our data suggest that CaMKII-autophosphorylation-dependent c-Fos expression in these areas controls distant contextual fear extinction and may shed light on these brain regions as potential targets for therapeutic strategies against emotional disorders such as PTSD.\nAutomated Maternal Behavior during Early life in Rodents (AMBER) pipeline\nAuthors: Lapp, H. E.; Salazar, M. G.; Champagne, F. A.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557946\nMother-infant interactions during the early postnatal period are critical for infant survival and the scaffolding of infant development. Rodent models are used extensively to understand how these early social experiences influence neurobiology across the lifespan. However, methods for measuring postnatal dam-pup interactions typically involve time-consuming manual scoring, vary widely between research groups, and produce low density data that limits downstream analytical applications. To address these methodological issues, we developed the Automated Maternal Behavior during Early life in Rodents (AMBER) pipeline for quantifying home-cage maternal and mother-pup interactions using open-source machine learning tools. DeepLabCut was used to track key points on rat dams (32 points) and individual pups (9 points per pup) in postnatal day 1-10 video recordings. Pose estimation models reached test errors of 14.39 pixels and 11.81 pixels for dam and pups respectively. Pose estimation data and human-annotated behavior labels from 30 videos were used with Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) to generate behavior classifiers for dam active nursing, passive nursing, nest attendance, licking and grooming, self-directed grooming, eating, and drinking using random forest algorithms. All classifiers had excellent performance, with F1 scores above .997. A set of 242 videos was used with AMBER and produced behavior measures in the expected range from postnatal 1-10 home-cage videos. This pipeline provides a basis for assessing home-cage dam-pup interactions that reduces experimenter burden while increasing reproducibility, reliability, and detail of data for use in developmental studies without the need for special housing systems or proprietary software.\nThree-dimensional markerless motion capture of multiple freely behaving monkeys for automated characterization of social behavior\nAuthors: Matsumoto, J.; Kaneko, T.; Kimura, K.; Negrete, S.

However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that utilized multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of various social events. Analyses of social looking facilitated the investigation of adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will significantly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.\nThe Egg-Counter: A novel microfluidic platform for characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying\nAuthors: Banse, S. A.; Jarrett, C. M.; Robinson, K. J.; Blue, B. W.; Shaw, E. L.; Phillips, P. C.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555781\nReproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ants, renowned for their intricate social behaviors, exhibit remarkable collective movement patterns that enable them to forage and tunnel efficiently. Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Agonistic and affiliative interactions with group members dictate individuals&#39; access to resources, and investment in competing for resources is often traded off with other needs. For example, reproductive investment can reduce body condition and, thereby, an individual&#39;s ability to win future agonistic interactions. However, group members may also alter their behaviour towards reproductive individuals, such as becoming more or less aggressive. Here, we investigated the social consequences of reproduction in female vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, a plural breeder in which females disperse and are subordinate to males. We found opposing patterns for breeders&#39; within- and between-sex dominance interactions from before to after breeding. Specifically, while breeding females became far less likely to win dominance interactions with non-breeding females after breeding than before breeding, they received considerably fewer male aggressions than non-breeding females after breeding. Using agent-based models, we then show that hierarchies inferred using the Percolation and Conductance method are robust to such variation in interaction rates, while other common methods may be prone to systematically overestimating or underestimating particular individuals&#39; hierarchy positions. Our study highlights reproduction as a driver of dominance dynamics, and illustrates how the study of dominance may benefit from considering variation in interaction rates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogs exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee 1,2, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the names owner 3. Labeling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by that object or individual is key to the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogs were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here, we show that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls without any evidence of imitating the receivers vocalizations. A random forest model correctly predicted receiver identity from call structure better than expected by chance, regardless of whether the calls were more or less similar to the receivers calls than typical for that caller. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual, indicating that they can determine from a calls structure if it was addressed to them. Our findings offer the first evidence for a non-human species individually addressing conspecifics without imitating the receiver.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Individually distinctive vocalizations are widespread in nature, although the ability of receivers to discriminate these signals has only been studied through limited taxonomic and social lenses. Here we ask whether anuran advertisement calls, typically studied for their role in territory defense and mate attraction, facilitate recognition and preferential association with partners in a pair bonding poison frog. Combining no- and two-stimulus choice playback experiments, we evaluated behavioral and physiological responses of females to male acoustic stimuli. Virgin females oriented to and approached speakers broadcasting male calls independent of caller identity, implying that females are generally attracted to male acoustic stimuli outside the context of a pair bond. When pair bonded females were presented with calls of a mate and a stranger, they showed a slight preference for calls of their mate. Moreover, behavioral responses varied with breeding status: females with eggs were faster to approach stimuli and spent more time in the mate arm than females that were pair bonded but did not currently have eggs. Our study suggests a potential role for individual vocal recognition in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds in a poison frog and raises new questions about how acoustic signals are perceived in the context of monogamy and biparental care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pervasive avoidance is one of the central symptoms of all anxiety-related disorders. In treatment, avoidance behaviors are typically discouraged because they are assumed to maintain anxiety. Yet, it is not clear that engaging in avoidance is always detrimental. In this study, we used a platform-mediated avoidance task to investigate the influence of avoidance history on extinction learning in male rats. Our results show that having the opportunity to avoid during fear acquisition training has no marked effect on the extinction of auditory cued fear in a platform-mediated avoidance procedure that constitutes a realistic approach/avoidance conflict in male rats, regardless of whether avoidance was possible during extinction or not. This suggests that imposing a realistic cost on avoidance behavior prevents the adverse effects that avoidance has been claimed to have on extinction, but even then, avoidance does not appear to have clear positive effects on extinction learning nor on retention either</p>

        <p class="abstract">While vocal learning is vital to language acquisition in children, adults continue to adjust their speech while adapting to different social environments in the form of social vocal accommodation (SVA). Even though adult and infant vocal learning seemingly differ in their properties, whether the mechanisms underlying them differ remains unknown. The complex structure of language creates a challenge in quantifying vocal changes during SVA. Consequently, animals with simpler vocal communication systems are powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying SVA. Here, we tracked acoustic changes in the vocalizations of adult common marmoset pairs, a highly vocal primate species known to show SVA, for up to 85 days after pairing with a new partner. We identified four properties of SVA in marmosets: (1) bidirectional learning, (2) exponential decrease in vocal distance with time, (3) sensitivity to initial vocal distance, and (4) dyadic acoustic feature synchrony. We developed a mathematical model that shows all four properties. The model suggests that marmosets continuously update the memory of their partners&#39; vocalizations and modify their own vocalizations to match them, a dynamic form of vocal learning. The model provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying SVA in adult animals and how they might differ from infant vocal learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Remote memory consolidation, extinction, and its impairments have been of interest to researchers for years, especially due to its clinical relevance in patients with emotional disorders, like PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), anxiety, and phobias. Its neuronal substrates are key elements to understand the persistent nature of remote memory and open a new perspective to novel therapeutic approaches for human fear-related disorders. While the majority of reports investigate the mechanisms and ensembles of recent fear memory extinction (hours to days following conditioning), only a few refer to the remote time point (i.e. weeks after conditioning), usually describing successful memory extinction. The neuronal correlates of impaired remote fear memory extinction were yet beyond the scope. Here we present selective impairment of contextual remote fear memory extinction in alpha calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation-limited mice (T286A&#43;/-). To map brain regions involved in this phenomenon, we applied screening of c-Fos expression, a neuroplasticity marker, across 23 brain areas following contextual fear conditioning and extinction of recent (1-day old) and remote (30-days old) fear memory in WT and T286A&#43;/- mice. Following impaired remote fear memory extinction in T286A&#43;/- mice, we found upregulated c-Fos expression in the entorhinal cortex (ENT), nucleus reuniens (RE), centromedial (CM), mediodorsal (MD), anterodorsal (AD) thalamic nuclei, and medial septum (MS), compared to WT animals performing normal remote fear memory extinction. Thus our data suggest that CaMKII-autophosphorylation-dependent c-Fos expression in these areas controls distant contextual fear extinction and may shed light on these brain regions as potential targets for therapeutic strategies against emotional disorders such as PTSD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mother-infant interactions during the early postnatal period are critical for infant survival and the scaffolding of infant development. Rodent models are used extensively to understand how these early social experiences influence neurobiology across the lifespan. However, methods for measuring postnatal dam-pup interactions typically involve time-consuming manual scoring, vary widely between research groups, and produce low density data that limits downstream analytical applications. To address these methodological issues, we developed the Automated Maternal Behavior during Early life in Rodents (AMBER) pipeline for quantifying home-cage maternal and mother-pup interactions using open-source machine learning tools. DeepLabCut was used to track key points on rat dams (32 points) and individual pups (9 points per pup) in postnatal day 1-10 video recordings. Pose estimation models reached test errors of 14.39 pixels and 11.81 pixels for dam and pups respectively. Pose estimation data and human-annotated behavior labels from 30 videos were used with Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) to generate behavior classifiers for dam active nursing, passive nursing, nest attendance, licking and grooming, self-directed grooming, eating, and drinking using random forest algorithms. All classifiers had excellent performance, with F1 scores above .997. A set of 242 videos was used with AMBER and produced behavior measures in the expected range from postnatal 1-10 home-cage videos. This pipeline provides a basis for assessing home-cage dam-pup interactions that reduces experimenter burden while increasing reproducibility, reliability, and detail of data for use in developmental studies without the need for special housing systems or proprietary software.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Given their high sociality and close evolutionary distance to humans, monkeys are an essential animal model for unraveling the biological mechanisms underlying human social behavior and elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases exhibiting abnormal social behavior. However, behavioral analysis of naturally behaving monkeys requires manual counting of various behaviors, which has been a bottleneck due to problems in throughput and objectivity. Here, we developed a three-dimensional markerless motion capture system that utilized multi-view data for robust tracking of individual monkeys and accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional poses of multiple monkeys living in groups. Validation analysis in two monkey groups revealed that the system enabled the characterization of individual social dispositions and relationships through automated detection of various social events. Analyses of social looking facilitated the investigation of adaptive behaviors in a social group. These results suggest that this motion capture system will significantly enhance our ability to analyze primate social behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.</p>
