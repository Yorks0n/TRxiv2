Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.\nGlucose intolerance induces anxiety-like behaviors independent of obesity and insulin resistance in a novel model of nutritional metabolic stress\nAuthors: Al-Onaizi, M.; Braysh, K.; Alkefeef, S.; Altarrah, D.; Dannoon, S.; Alasousi, D.; Adel, H.; Al-Ajmi, M.; Kandari, A.; Najem, R.; Nizam, R.; Williams, M.

In addition to peripheral tissues, T2D also impacts the central nervous system leading to neurocognitive impairments, including memory deficits, anxiety, and depression. The metabolic determinants of these neurocognitive impairments remain unidentified. Here, we used a novel proprietary high-fat diet, in which glucose intolerance precedes weight gain, to decipher the metabolic determinants of neurocognitive affects. We show that this model exhibits anxiety-like behaviors, without eliciting depression nor recognition memory deficits. Long-term feeding leads to weight gain, brain glucose hypometabolism and impaired recognition memory alongside the early onset anxiety-like behavior. Using an established genetic model of T2D (db/db) and of diet-induced obesity we show that additional insulin resistance and obesity are associated with depressive-like behaviors and recognition memory deficits. Our findings indicate that glucose intolerance alone can elicit anxiety-like behaviors. Through this study we also provide a novel nutritional model to characterize the discrete effects of glucose intolerance on cognition, behavior, and the physiology of metabolic disease.\nNatural disaster alters the adaptive benefits of sociality\nAuthors: Testard, C.; Shergold, C.; Acevedo-Ithier, A.; Hart, J.; Negron-Del Valle, J.; Philips, D.; Watowich, M.; Sanguinetti-Scheck, J.

How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems. One-Sentence SummaryTestard et al. show that natural disasters alter the adaptive benefits of sociality triggering persistent behavioral changes in animals.\nSocial complexity affects cognitive abilities but not brain structure in a Poecilid fish\nAuthors: Triki, Z.; Zhou, T.; Argyriou, E.; Sousa de Novais, E.; Servant, O.; Kolm, N.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.20.554009\nComplex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated Machiavellian strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.\n(De)composing sociality: disentangling individual-specific from dyad-specific propensities to interact\nAuthors: Neumann, C.; Fischer, J.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.549768\nO_LIIn socially living animals, relationships between group members are typically highly differentiated. Some dyads maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak ties. There is growing evidence that the number and strength of social bonds are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals are driven by two different processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of the individuals involved and their dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to inter-act specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness. C_LIO_LIWe present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We provide the R package bamoso, which builds on Stan code to implement models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes. C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the application and some of the critical advantages of our proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level sociality and individual-level outcomes in a unified model. C_LIO_LIOur model will help to understand how and why individuals interact with each other and will help address questions about the relationship between variation in sociality and other features of interest, both within and across species.

S.; Jackson, M.; Zamansky, A.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.552730\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe emerging field of canine cognitive neuroscience uses neuroimaging tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cognitive processes of dogs to neural substrates in their brain. Within the past decade, the non-invasive use of EEG has provided real-time, accessible, and portable neuroimaging insight into canine cognitive processes. To promote systematization and create an overview of framings, methods and findings for future work, we provide a systematic review of non-invasive canine EEG studies (N=22), dissecting their study makeup, technical setup, and analysis frameworks and highlighting emerging trends. We further propose new directions of development, such as the standardization of data structures and integrating predictive modeling with descriptive statistical approaches. Our review ends by underscoring the advances and advantages of EEG-based canine cognitive neuroscience and the potential for accessible canine neuroimaging to inform both fundamental sciences as well as practical applications for cognitive neuroscience, working dogs, and human-canine interactions.\nImpact of Yaq-001, a non-absorbable, engineered carbon bead of controlled porosity in rodent models of cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure\nAuthors: Liu, J.; Macnaughtan, J.; Jin, Y.; Clasen, F.; Habtesion, A.; Phillips, A.; De Chiara, F.; Ingavle, G.; Cordero-Sanchez, P.; Soeda, J.; Oben, J.

Current strategies to target bacterial translocation are limited to antibiotics with risk of resistance. This study aims to explore therapeutic potential of a non-absorbable, engineered carbon bead, Yaq-001 in cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) models. DesignThe performance of Yaq-001 was evaluated in in vitro studies. Two-rodent models of cirrhosis (4-week, bile duct ligation (BDL): Sham (n=36); Sham-Yaq-001 (n=30); BDL (n=37); BDL-Yaq-001 (n=44)) and ACLF (BDL-LPS: Sham-LPS (n=9); Sham-LPS-Yaq-001 (n=10); BDL-LPS (n=16); BDL-LPS-Yaq-001(n=12)). The treated-groups received Yaq-001 for 2-weeks. Samples were collected for assessment of organ and immune function, transcriptomics, microbiome composition and metabolomics. ResultsIn vitro, Yaq-001 exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics for endotoxin and bile acids without exerting an antibiotic effect. In vivo, Yaq-001 produced significant improvement in ALT, ammonia, liver cell death, portal pressure, markers of systemic inflammation and renal function in BDL animals. Yaq-001-treated ACLF animals had significantly better survival, ALT, portal pressure, brain water and creatinine. Ex-vivo LPS-induced reactive oxygen species production in portal venous monocytes and Kupffer cell populations was diminished with Yaq-001 treatment. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated a significant modulation of inflammation, cell death and senescence pathways in the liver, kidneys, brain and colon of Yaq-001-treated BDL rats. Yaq-001 impacted positively on the microbiome composition with significant modulation of Family Porphyromonadaceae and Genus Barnesiella. Urinary 1HNMR analysis suggested a shift in metabolomic signature in Yaq-001-treated BDL rats. ConclusionsThis study provides strong pre-clinical rationale for developing Yaq-001 for treatment of patients with cirrhosis. Significance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSCurrent strategies to target bacterial translocation in cirrhosis are limited to antibiotics with risk of resistance. Yaq-001 is an insoluble, non-absorbable, non-antibiotic, engineered carbon bead of tailored porosities, which works as an adsorbent in the gut and is completely excreted after oral administration. What this study adds?O_LIYaq-001 rapidly adsorbs endotoxin, ammonia and bile acids without influencing bacterial growth kinetics in vitro. C_LIO_LIYaq-001 reduces mortality of ACLF animals and impacts positively on markers of gut permeability, liver injury, portal pressure, brain and kidneys in rodent models of cirrhosis and ACLF. C_LIO_LIYaq-001 administration was associated with positive impact on the composition of the gut microbiota, reduction in severity of endotoxemia and ammonia, which significantly reduced the severity of inflammation, cell death, signaling pathways and LPS sensitivity. C_LI How this study might affect research, practice or policy?The data provide the pre-clinical rationale to proceed to clinical trials in patients with cirrhosis aiming to prevent the occurrence of complications.\nFawn bedsite selection by a large ungulate living in a peri-urban area\nAuthors: Conteddu, K.; Wilson, K.; Amin, B.; Chari, S.; Haigh, A.; Griffin, L.

F.; Ciuti, S.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.552922\nHuman populations continue to grow at an unprecedented rate, along with the associated anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, exploring wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and informing wildlife management decisions. Here, we explored how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns responded to human and dog presence during the birthing period in the largest walled urban park in Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) space use, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least [~]200m. Bedsites were also unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Additionally, fallow deer mothers were found to select for dense understory vegetation for bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal their offspring. Our results provide detailed insights into how female fallow deer adapt their spatial and habitat selection for bedsites during the fawning season in response to human activities, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites in order to alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.\nCrowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling reveal parrot tool use is not rare\nAuthors: Bastos, A. P.; Claessens, S.; Nelson, X. J.; Welch, D.; Atkinson, Q. D.; Taylor, A. H.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553302\nStudying the prevalence of putatively rare behaviours, such as tool use, is challenging because absence of evidence can arise either from a species inability to produce the behaviour or from insufficient research effort. Here, we tackle this challenge by combining crowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling to approximate actual rates of a rarely observed behaviour based on limited data, targeting tool use in parrots. Crowdsourcing on a social media platform revealed novel instances of tool use in 17 parrot species, more than doubling the confirmed number of tool-using parrot species from 11 (3%) to 28 (7%). Phylogenetic modelling ranked additional species that are most likely to be unobserved tool users, suggesting that between 11% and 17% of extant parrot species may be tool users. These discoveries have implications for inferences about the evolutionary drivers and origins of tool use in parrots, revealing associations with relative brain size and feeding generalism and indicating several genera where tool use was likely an ancestral trait. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that current sampling effort captures the full distribution of putatively rare animal behaviours. Combining our sampling and analysis methods offers a fruitful approach for investigating the distribution, drivers, and origins of other rare behaviours.

        <p class="abstract">Play-like behaviour (PLB) is pervasive across the animal kingdom, especially in vertebrate species. Invertebrate PLB has been sparsely addressed and those studies have been restricted to social or object interaction. Here, we examined individual PLB in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster by providing voluntary access to a spinning platform - a carousel. We demonstrate that the flies idiosyncratic carousel interactions qualify as play-like behaviour: while some flies show spontaneous avoidance, others exhibit active stimulus seeking, engaging in repeated, prolonged visits. We propose that this self-exposure to external forces achieves intentional exafferent stimulation, which provides an efficient way to improve self-perception via internal model training and can shape multisensory integration.

One-Sentence SummaryVinegar flies seek self-stimulation on a carousel.

        <p class="abstract">For nonhuman primates living in anthropogenic areas, predation by larger predators is relatively rare. However, smaller predators such as free-ranging as well as domesticated dogs can shape the socioecology of urban nonhuman primates, directly by attacking and predating upon them, or indirectly by modifying their activity patterns. Here, we describe 3 (2 potentially lethal) cases of dog attacks on adult rhesus macaques inhabiting an anthropogenic landscape in Northern India, and the circumstances surrounding these incidents. We discuss the importance of considering the presence of dogs while studying nonhuman primate populations across the anthropogenic gradient and its implications for understanding how human presence can directly and indirectly affect predator-prey relationship in these areas, as well as its potential role in modifying group social dynamics as well as in transmission of zoonotic agents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its comorbidities are a major public health concern. In addition to peripheral tissues, T2D also impacts the central nervous system leading to neurocognitive impairments, including memory deficits, anxiety, and depression. The metabolic determinants of these neurocognitive impairments remain unidentified. Here, we used a novel proprietary high-fat diet, in which glucose intolerance precedes weight gain, to decipher the metabolic determinants of neurocognitive affects. We show that this model exhibits anxiety-like behaviors, without eliciting depression nor recognition memory deficits. Long-term feeding leads to weight gain, brain glucose hypometabolism and impaired recognition memory alongside the early onset anxiety-like behavior. Using an established genetic model of T2D (db/db) and of diet-induced obesity we show that additional insulin resistance and obesity are associated with depressive-like behaviors and recognition memory deficits. Our findings indicate that glucose intolerance alone can elicit anxiety-like behaviors. Through this study we also provide a novel nutritional model to characterize the discrete effects of glucose intolerance on cognition, behavior, and the physiology of metabolic disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Global warming intensifies weather-related disasters that radically alter ecosystems. How animals respond to these abrupt and lasting ecological changes remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged an unprecedented study of rhesus macaques from 5 years before to 5 years after a category 4 hurricane, which destroyed 63% of the islands vegetation and exacerbated monkeys exposure to intense heat. In response, macaques dramatically and persistently increased tolerance for other monkeys. Social tolerance predicted individual survival after the hurricane-but not before it-by facilitating access to now scarce shade critical for lowering body temperature. We demonstrate that an extreme climatic event altered the adaptive benefits of sociality and triggered substantial and persistent changes in social structure of group-living animals-with consequences for the resilience of populations living in degraded ecosystems.

        <p class="abstract">Complex cognitive performance is suggested to be the out-turn of complex social life, allowing individuals to achieve higher fitness through sophisticated Machiavellian strategies. Although there is ample support for this concept, especially when comparing species, most of the evidence is correlative. Here we provide an experimental investigation of how group size and composition may affect brain and cognitive development in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). For six months, we reared sexually mature female guppies in one of three different social treatments: (i) three female guppies; (ii) three female guppies mixed with three female splash tetras (Copella arnoldi), a species that co-occurs with the guppy in the wild; and (iii) six female guppies. We then tested the guppies performance in inhibitory control, associative learning and reversal learning tasks to evaluate their self-control, operant conditioning and cognitive flexibility capabilities. Afterwards, we estimated their brain size and the size of major brain regions using X-ray imaging technology. We found that individuals in larger groups of six individuals, in both same and mixed species treatments, outperformed individuals from the smaller groups of three guppies in reversal learning, with no apparent differences in the inhibitory control and associative learning tasks. This is rare evidence of how living in larger social groups improves cognitive flexibility, supporting that social pressures play an important role in shaping individual cognitive development. Interestingly, social manipulation had no apparent effect on brain morphology, but relatively larger telencephalons were associated with better individual performance in reversal learning. This suggests alternative mechanisms beyond brain region size enabled greater cognitive flexibility in individuals from larger groups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIIn socially living animals, relationships between group members are typically highly differentiated. Some dyads maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak ties. There is growing evidence that the number and strength of social bonds are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals are driven by two different processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of the individuals involved and their dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to inter-act specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness.
C_LIO_LIWe present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We provide the R package bamoso, which builds on Stan code to implement models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the application and some of the critical advantages of our proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level sociality and individual-level outcomes in a unified model.
C_LIO_LIOur model will help to understand how and why individuals interact with each other and will help address questions about the relationship between variation in sociality and other features of interest, both within and across species.

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe emerging field of canine cognitive neuroscience uses neuroimaging tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cognitive processes of dogs to neural substrates in their brain. Within the past decade, the non-invasive use of EEG has provided real-time, accessible, and portable neuroimaging insight into canine cognitive processes. To promote systematization and create an overview of framings, methods and findings for future work, we provide a systematic review of non-invasive canine EEG studies (N=22), dissecting their study makeup, technical setup, and analysis frameworks and highlighting emerging trends. We further propose new directions of development, such as the standardization of data structures and integrating predictive modeling with descriptive statistical approaches. Our review ends by underscoring the advances and advantages of EEG-based canine cognitive neuroscience and the potential for accessible canine neuroimaging to inform both fundamental sciences as well as practical applications for cognitive neuroscience, working dogs, and human-canine interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTranslocation of gut bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is associated with complications of cirrhosis. Current strategies to target bacterial translocation are limited to antibiotics with risk of resistance. This study aims to explore therapeutic potential of a non-absorbable, engineered carbon bead, Yaq-001 in cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) models.

DesignThe performance of Yaq-001 was evaluated in in vitro studies. Two-rodent models of cirrhosis (4-week, bile duct ligation (BDL): Sham (n=36); Sham-Yaq-001 (n=30); BDL (n=37); BDL-Yaq-001 (n=44)) and ACLF (BDL-LPS: Sham-LPS (n=9); Sham-LPS-Yaq-001 (n=10); BDL-LPS (n=16); BDL-LPS-Yaq-001(n=12)). The treated-groups received Yaq-001 for 2-weeks. Samples were collected for assessment of organ and immune function, transcriptomics, microbiome composition and metabolomics.

ResultsIn vitro, Yaq-001 exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics for endotoxin and bile acids without exerting an antibiotic effect. In vivo, Yaq-001 produced significant improvement in ALT, ammonia, liver cell death, portal pressure, markers of systemic inflammation and renal function in BDL animals. Yaq-001-treated ACLF animals had significantly better survival, ALT, portal pressure, brain water and creatinine. Ex-vivo LPS-induced reactive oxygen species production in portal venous monocytes and Kupffer cell populations was diminished with Yaq-001 treatment. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated a significant modulation of inflammation, cell death and senescence pathways in the liver, kidneys, brain and colon of Yaq-001-treated BDL rats. Yaq-001 impacted positively on the microbiome composition with significant modulation of Family Porphyromonadaceae and Genus Barnesiella. Urinary 1HNMR analysis suggested a shift in metabolomic signature in Yaq-001-treated BDL rats.

ConclusionsThis study provides strong pre-clinical rationale for developing Yaq-001 for treatment of patients with cirrhosis.

Significance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSCurrent strategies to target bacterial translocation in cirrhosis are limited to antibiotics with risk of resistance. Yaq-001 is an insoluble, non-absorbable, non-antibiotic, engineered carbon bead of tailored porosities, which works as an adsorbent in the gut and is completely excreted after oral administration.

What this study adds?O_LIYaq-001 rapidly adsorbs endotoxin, ammonia and bile acids without influencing bacterial growth kinetics in vitro.
C_LIO_LIYaq-001 reduces mortality of ACLF animals and impacts positively on markers of gut permeability, liver injury, portal pressure, brain and kidneys in rodent models of cirrhosis and ACLF.
C_LIO_LIYaq-001 administration was associated with positive impact on the composition of the gut microbiota, reduction in severity of endotoxemia and ammonia, which significantly reduced the severity of inflammation, cell death, signaling pathways and LPS sensitivity.
C_LI

How this study might affect research, practice or policy?The data provide the pre-clinical rationale to proceed to clinical trials in patients with cirrhosis aiming to prevent the occurrence of complications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human populations continue to grow at an unprecedented rate, along with the associated anthropogenic footprint on wildlife habitats. As a result, human-wildlife conflict in expanding peri-urban and urban areas is of increasing concern. Empirical data from wildlife research carried out within human dominated landscapes are key to understanding the effects of human pressures on wildlife ecology and behaviour, exploring wildlife behavioural flexibility (or phenotypic plasticity), and informing wildlife management decisions. Here, we explored how female fallow deer (Dama dama) and their fawns responded to human and dog presence during the birthing period in the largest walled urban park in Europe, which receives 10 million visitors along with their dogs every year. We collected data on 481 bedsites utilised by 285 neonate fawns across three consecutive fawning seasons, gathered fine-scale data on humans (and dogs) space use, and built Resource Selection Functions at multiple spatial scales. We found that, when choosing bedsites to give birth and leave fawns unattended, fallow deer mothers significantly avoided hotspots of park visitors on foot (and their dogs) along the hiking trail network, maintaining a distance of at least [~]200m. Bedsites were also unlikely to be in close proximity, within 50 meters, of paved roads used by vehicle traffic. Additionally, fallow deer mothers were found to select for dense understory vegetation for bedsites, providing low visibility to conceal their offspring. Our results provide detailed insights into how female fallow deer adapt their spatial and habitat selection for bedsites during the fawning season in response to human activities, and provide clear indications to wildlife managers to preserve traditional fawning sites in order to alleviate human-wildlife conflict during a critical period of the deer annual biological cycle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studying the prevalence of putatively rare behaviours, such as tool use, is challenging because absence of evidence can arise either from a species inability to produce the behaviour or from insufficient research effort. Here, we tackle this challenge by combining crowdsourcing and phylogenetic modelling to approximate actual rates of a rarely observed behaviour based on limited data, targeting tool use in parrots. Crowdsourcing on a social media platform revealed novel instances of tool use in 17 parrot species, more than doubling the confirmed number of tool-using parrot species from 11 (3%) to 28 (7%). Phylogenetic modelling ranked additional species that are most likely to be unobserved tool users, suggesting that between 11% and 17% of extant parrot species may be tool users. These discoveries have implications for inferences about the evolutionary drivers and origins of tool use in parrots, revealing associations with relative brain size and feeding generalism and indicating several genera where tool use was likely an ancestral trait. Overall, our findings challenge the assumption that current sampling effort captures the full distribution of putatively rare animal behaviours. Combining our sampling and analysis methods offers a fruitful approach for investigating the distribution, drivers, and origins of other rare behaviours.
