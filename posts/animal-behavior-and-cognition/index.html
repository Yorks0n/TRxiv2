A.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573797\nAssociative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.\nChanges in enclosure use and basking behaviour associated with pair housing in Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko)\nAuthors: Szabo, B.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574605\nDue to often insufficient information reptiles suffer welfare issues and increased mortality in captivity. In particular, the impact of the social environment remains poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting its importance for welfare in a wide range social animals. The current study investigated how pair housing changes enclosure use, basking and hiding behaviour in tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). While the captive conditions and husbandry procedures employed in this study align with existing literature recommendations, they have not been previously evaluated for their suitability for this particular species. The results show that, when socially deprived, lizards were more likely to move and hide before feeding. Furthermore, males were more likely to be found at the front than females during pair housing but not during single housing. Finally, contrary to single housing, enclosure temperature had no effect on the probability to move and hide behind a shelter during pair housing. Consistently, however, lizards were more likely to bask after feeding across housing conditions and females were more likely to bask before their first clutch. Together, pair housing decreases movement and hiding in relation to human presence (feeding) which might indicate that pair housing improves tokay gecko welfare and suggest that the presence of a conspecific should be considered to improve welfare policies in social reptiles. This study serves as a baseline for future research into how enclosure furnishings, husbandry techniques, and enrichment practices impact the welfare of tokay geckos which will be crucial for refining our understanding of and improving on the welfare of reptiles in captivity.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nInvariant crossmodal equivalence between objects in rhesus monkeys\nAuthors: Cabrera-Ruiz, E.; Alva, M.; Mata, M.; Trevino, M.; Vergara, J.; Figueroa, T.; Perez-Orive, J.; Lemus, L.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574397\nAfter hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.\nAnts hold a grudge: Associative learning of non-nestmate cues improves enemy recognition\nAuthors: Bey, M.; Endermann, R.; Raudies, C.; Steinle, J.; Nehring, V.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572127\nRecognition protects biological systems of all scales, from cells to societies. Social insects recognize their nestmates by colony-specific chemical labels, which individuals store as \"templates\" in their memories. The distributed model of nestmate recognition predicts that individual experiences cause variation between the recognition templates that different individuals store in their memory. Here, we show for the first time that ants associatively learn recognition labels of both friends and enemies during brief encounters. Because different individuals will accumulate different experiences throughout their lives, their later decisions on whether to accept or reject other individuals will also vary. Individual associative learning can thus explain many phenomena from nasty neighbour effects to age polyethism. To avoid chaos caused by inconsistent decisions across individuals, decisions are made in a distributed manner at the colony level. Group-level decision can thus be much more accurate than any individual decision alone.\nReinforcement Expectation in the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera): Downshifts in Reinforcement Show Conditioned Inhibition\nAuthors: Mahoney, S.; Hosler, J.; Smith, B. H. H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574098\nWhen animals learn the association of a Conditioned Stimulus with an Unconditioned Stimulus, later presentation of the CS invokes a representation of the US. When the expected US fails to occur, theoretical accounts predict that conditioned inhibition can accrue to any other stimuli that are associated with this change in the US. Empirical work with mammals has confirmed the existence of conditioned inhibition. But the way it is manifested, the conditions that produce it, and determining whether it is the opposite of excitatory conditioning, are important considerations. Invertebrates can make valuable contributions to this literature because of the well-established conditioning protocols and access to the central nervous system for studying neural underpinnings of behavior. Nevertheless, conditioned inhibition has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in invertebrates. Here we evaluate the role of the unconditioned stimulus (US) in producing conditioned inhibition by using Proboscis Extension Response conditioning of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Specifically, using variations of a feature-negative experimental design, we employ downshifts in US intensity relative to US intensity used during initial excitatory conditioning, to show that an odorant in an odor-odor mixture can become a conditioned inhibitor. We argue that alternative interpretations to conditioned inhibition are unlikely. However, we show variation across individuals in how strongly they show Conditioned Inhibition, with some individuals possibly revealing a different means of learning about changes in reinforcement. We discuss how more work can reveal more details of conditioned inhibition, how it can be extended to investigate how it is encoded in the CNS, and how the work can generalize to other insect models. On particular, work like this will be important as more is revealed of the complexity of the insect brain from connectome projects.\nBehavioural Investigations of Psilocybin in Animals 1962-2021: A Scoping Review\nAuthors: Shore, R. J.; Dobson, K.; Thomson, N.; Barnim, N.; Bergman, H.; Rideout, K.; Mckeown, S.; Olmstead, M.; Goldie, C.; Dumont, E.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.574146\nBackground and AimsPsilocybin is a psychedelic drug that may hold promise for a wide range of human health conditions, yet the identification of therapeutic processes and mechanisms of action remains exploratory. We conducted a scoping review on pre-clinical behavioural investigations of psilocybin in non-human animals to help determine the behavioural effects of psilocybin in non-human animals, to identify studies completed, behavioural tests employed, and what dosing modalities had been studied. MethodsA librarian-conducted literature search was performed using predefined key terms and search criteria and additional searching was conducted by reviewers, using electronic databases, grey literature sources, and reference lists of relevant articles or reviews. The final search updated occurred in October, 2021. Studies were reviewed, screened and selected against an a priori protocol using Covidence software by multiple reviewers with results plotted across the Research Domains Criteria construct. ResultsFrom 4124 records identified by database searching, 260 publications were subjected to full-text review with 77 studies included in this scoping review, published between 1962-2021. The preponderance of studies (n=64) investigated behavioural outcomes in rodents. Only 43 studies (55.8%) reported on housing conditions, and seventeen studies (22.1%) failed to report sample size. All studies reported behavioural outcomes following drug administration, with fifty-one studies (66.2%) using psilocybin, thirty studies (42.9%) psilocin, four studies (5.2%) administering whole mushroom extracts (WME), and a further eight studies investigating both psilocybin and psilocin and one study reporting the effects of both psilocin and WME. One hundred and thirty distinct behavioural investigations using fifty different behavioral paradigms were identified. Few adverse events were reported, and even exceedingly high doses were apparently well tolerated. ConclusionWith seventy-seven publications spanning close to sixty years, there is huge variation in study design and quality. Overall psilocybin presents a unique and strong safety profile with no evidence of biological toxicity, is characterized by unique time and dose-dependent effects, and its pattern of drug action is significantly context and training-sensitive. Data suggest putative effects of psilocybin include acute arousal, dose-dependent sedation, reductions in fear conditioning at low doses, reduced aggression, improved valence, acute disruption of working memory, the rescuing of deficits from chronic stress, and improved learning when combined with repeated environmental exposure after resolution of drug effect.\nDeepRod: A human-in-the-loop system for automatic rodent behavior analysis\nAuthors: Loy, A.; Garafolj, M.; Schauerte, H.; Behnke, H.; Charnier, C.; Schwarz, P.; Rast, G.; Wollmann, T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.572506\nWe present a human-in-the-loop system for efficient rodent behavior analysis in drug development. Addressing the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual behavior categorization, this UX-optimized platform integrates AI for complex behavior prediction and active learning to identify rare events. The proposed solution leverages a cloud-native data processing pipeline, AI-based novelty behavior recognition and multi-class classification, demonstrating significant improvements in behavior labeling and discovery.\nSEX-SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF EARLY LIFE SLEEP DISRUPTION: ETHANOL SEEKING, SOCIAL INTERACTION, AND ANXIETY ARE DIFFERENTIALLY ALTERED IN ADOLESCENT PRAIRIE VOLES\nAuthors: Ginder, D. E.; Tinsley, C. E.; Kaiser, M. E.; Lim, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574112\nEarly life sleep is important for neuronal development and maturation. Using the highly social prairie vole rodent model, we have previously reported that early-life sleep disruption (ELSD) during the pre-weaning period postnatal day (P)14 to 21 results in adult interference with social bonding and increases ethanol consumption following a stressor. Furthermore, we have reported increased parvalbumin expression and reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission in cortical regions in adult prairie voles that experienced this paradigm. To understand the impact of ELSD on the lifespan, examination of an earlier time in life is necessary. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the behavioral outcomes of ELSD on adolescent prairie voles. Here we hypothesized that anxiety and reward related behaviors, as measured by light/dark box, 2-bottle choice and social interactions, would be negatively impacted by ELSD in adolescent male and female prairie voles. Male ELSD voles were no different from control voles in measures of anxiety and ethanol preference or consumption, but affiliative social interactions were significantly reduced. ELSD differentially impacted female prairie voles, with increased anxiety-like behavior and reductions in ethanol consumption compared to Controls, but no impact on ethanol preference or social interactions. Together, these results suggest both male and female prairie voles experience differential changes to reward seeking behaviors, but only female prairie voles showed increases in anxiety-like behavior. These results further suggest that early-life sleep is critically important for neurotypical behaviors in adolescence, a time where reward-seeking and risky behaviors are adaptive for learning and promoting survival.\nMedial prefrontal cortex suppresses reward-seeking behavior with risk of positive punishment by reducing sensitivity to reward\nAuthors: Nishio, M.; Kondo, M.; Eriko, Y.; Matsuzaki, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-03 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.573768\nReward-seeking behavior is frequently associated with risk of punishment. There are two types of punishment: positive, resulting in an unpleasant outcome, and negative, resulting in omission of a reinforcing outcome. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important in avoiding punishment, whether it is important for avoiding both positive and negative punishment and how it contributes to such avoidance are not clear. In this study, we trained male mice to perform decision-making tasks under the risks of positive (air-puff stimulus) and negative (reward omission) punishment. We found that pharmacological inactivation of mPFC enhanced the reward-seeking choice under the risk of positive, but not negative, punishment. In reinforcement learning models, this behavioral change was well-explained by hypersensitivity to the reward, rather than a decrease in the strength of aversion to punishment. Our results suggest that mPFC suppresses reward-seeking behavior by reducing sensitivity to reward under the risk of positive punishment.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Associative learning can drive many different types of behaviors, including food consumption. Previous studies have shown that cues paired with food delivery while mice are hungry will lead increased consumption in the presence of those cues at later times. We previously showed that overconsumption can be driven in male mice by contextual cues, using chow pellets. Here we extended our findings by examining other parameters that may influence the outcome of context-conditioned overconsumption training. We found that the task worked equally well in males and females, and that palatable substances such as high-fat diet and Ensure chocolate milkshake supported learning and induced overconsumption. Surprisingly, mice did not overconsume when sucrose was used as the reinforcer during training, suggesting that nutritional content is a critical factor. Interestingly, we also observed that diet-induced obese mice did not learn the task. Overall, we find that context-conditioned overconsumption can be studied in lean males and female mice, and with multiple reinforcer types.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Due to often insufficient information reptiles suffer welfare issues and increased mortality in captivity. In particular, the impact of the social environment remains poorly understood, despite evidence suggesting its importance for welfare in a wide range social animals. The current study investigated how pair housing changes enclosure use, basking and hiding behaviour in tokay geckos (Gekko gecko). While the captive conditions and husbandry procedures employed in this study align with existing literature recommendations, they have not been previously evaluated for their suitability for this particular species. The results show that, when socially deprived, lizards were more likely to move and hide before feeding. Furthermore, males were more likely to be found at the front than females during pair housing but not during single housing. Finally, contrary to single housing, enclosure temperature had no effect on the probability to move and hide behind a shelter during pair housing. Consistently, however, lizards were more likely to bask after feeding across housing conditions and females were more likely to bask before their first clutch. Together, pair housing decreases movement and hiding in relation to human presence (feeding) which might indicate that pair housing improves tokay gecko welfare and suggest that the presence of a conspecific should be considered to improve welfare policies in social reptiles. This study serves as a baseline for future research into how enclosure furnishings, husbandry techniques, and enrichment practices impact the welfare of tokay geckos which will be crucial for refining our understanding of and improving on the welfare of reptiles in captivity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">After hearing the words Little Red Riding Hood, most humans instantly visualize a girl wearing a red hood in the woods. However, whether nonhuman primates also evoke such visual imagery from sounds remains an open question. We sought to explore this from direct behavioral measurements from two rhesus macaques trained in a delayed crossmodal equivalence task. In each trial, they listened to a sound, such as a monkey vocalization or a word, and three seconds later, selected a visual equivalent out of a pool of 2 to 4 pictures appearing on a touchscreen. We propose two potential mechanisms for the brain to solve this task: acoustic memory or visual imagery. In the first, sounds representations should remain in working memory to discriminate later against the pictures on the screen. In the second, listening to sounds could evoke visual representations of pictures that appear on the touchscreen afterward. After analyzing the monkeys choice accuracies and reaction times in the task, we deduce that they experience visual imagery when listening to sounds. Therefore, the ability of rhesus monkeys to perceive crossmodal equivalences between learned categories poses rhesus monkeys as an ideal model organism for studying high-order cognitive processes like semantics and conceptual thinking at the single-neuron level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recognition protects biological systems of all scales, from cells to societies. Social insects recognize their nestmates by colony-specific chemical labels, which individuals store as &#34;templates&#34; in their memories. The distributed model of nestmate recognition predicts that individual experiences cause variation between the recognition templates that different individuals store in their memory. Here, we show for the first time that ants associatively learn recognition labels of both friends and enemies during brief encounters. Because different individuals will accumulate different experiences throughout their lives, their later decisions on whether to accept or reject other individuals will also vary. Individual associative learning can thus explain many phenomena from nasty neighbour effects to age polyethism. To avoid chaos caused by inconsistent decisions across individuals, decisions are made in a distributed manner at the colony level. Group-level decision can thus be much more accurate than any individual decision alone.</p>

        <p class="abstract">When animals learn the association of a Conditioned Stimulus with an Unconditioned Stimulus, later presentation of the CS invokes a representation of the US. When the expected US fails to occur, theoretical accounts predict that conditioned inhibition can accrue to any other stimuli that are associated with this change in the US. Empirical work with mammals has confirmed the existence of conditioned inhibition. But the way it is manifested, the conditions that produce it, and determining whether it is the opposite of excitatory conditioning, are important considerations. Invertebrates can make valuable contributions to this literature because of the well-established conditioning protocols and access to the central nervous system for studying neural underpinnings of behavior. Nevertheless, conditioned inhibition has yet to be conclusively demonstrated in invertebrates. Here we evaluate the role of the unconditioned stimulus (US) in producing conditioned inhibition by using Proboscis Extension Response conditioning of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). Specifically, using variations of a  feature-negative experimental design, we employ downshifts in US intensity relative to US intensity used during initial excitatory conditioning, to show that an odorant in an odor-odor mixture can become a conditioned inhibitor. We argue that alternative interpretations to conditioned inhibition are unlikely. However, we show variation across individuals in how strongly they show Conditioned Inhibition, with some individuals possibly revealing a different means of learning about changes in reinforcement. We discuss how more work can reveal more details of conditioned inhibition, how it can be extended to investigate how it is encoded in the CNS, and how the work can generalize to other insect models. On particular, work like this will be important as more is revealed of the complexity of the insect brain from connectome projects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and AimsPsilocybin is a psychedelic drug that may hold promise for a wide range of human health conditions, yet the identification of therapeutic processes and mechanisms of action remains exploratory. We conducted a scoping review on pre-clinical behavioural investigations of psilocybin in non-human animals to help determine the behavioural effects of psilocybin in non-human animals, to identify studies completed, behavioural tests employed, and what dosing modalities had been studied.

MethodsA librarian-conducted literature search was performed using predefined key terms and search criteria and additional searching was conducted by reviewers, using electronic databases, grey literature sources, and reference lists of relevant articles or reviews. The final search updated occurred in October, 2021. Studies were reviewed, screened and selected against an a priori protocol using Covidence software by multiple reviewers with results plotted across the Research Domains Criteria construct.

ResultsFrom 4124 records identified by database searching, 260 publications were subjected to full-text review with 77 studies included in this scoping review, published between 1962-2021. The preponderance of studies (n=64) investigated behavioural outcomes in rodents. Only 43 studies (55.8%) reported on housing conditions, and seventeen studies (22.1%) failed to report sample size. All studies reported behavioural outcomes following drug administration, with fifty-one studies (66.2%) using psilocybin, thirty studies (42.9%) psilocin, four studies (5.2%) administering whole mushroom extracts (WME), and a further eight studies investigating both psilocybin and psilocin and one study reporting the effects of both psilocin and WME. One hundred and thirty distinct behavioural investigations using fifty different behavioral paradigms were identified. Few adverse events were reported, and even exceedingly high doses were apparently well tolerated.

ConclusionWith seventy-seven publications spanning close to sixty years, there is huge variation in study design and quality. Overall psilocybin presents a unique and strong safety profile with no evidence of biological toxicity, is characterized by unique time and dose-dependent effects, and its pattern of drug action is significantly context and training-sensitive. Data suggest putative effects of psilocybin include acute arousal, dose-dependent sedation, reductions in fear conditioning at low doses, reduced aggression, improved valence, acute disruption of working memory, the rescuing of deficits from chronic stress, and improved learning when combined with repeated environmental exposure after resolution of drug effect.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early life sleep is important for neuronal development and maturation. Using the highly social prairie vole rodent model, we have previously reported that early-life sleep disruption (ELSD) during the pre-weaning period postnatal day (P)14 to 21 results in adult interference with social bonding and increases ethanol consumption following a stressor. Furthermore, we have reported increased parvalbumin expression and reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission in cortical regions in adult prairie voles that experienced this paradigm. To understand the impact of ELSD on the lifespan, examination of an earlier time in life is necessary. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the behavioral outcomes of ELSD on adolescent prairie voles. Here we hypothesized that anxiety and reward related behaviors, as measured by light/dark box, 2-bottle choice and social interactions, would be negatively impacted by ELSD in adolescent male and female prairie voles. Male ELSD voles were no different from control voles in measures of anxiety and ethanol preference or consumption, but affiliative social interactions were significantly reduced. ELSD differentially impacted female prairie voles, with increased anxiety-like behavior and reductions in ethanol consumption compared to Controls, but no impact on ethanol preference or social interactions. Together, these results suggest both male and female prairie voles experience differential changes to reward seeking behaviors, but only female prairie voles showed increases in anxiety-like behavior. These results further suggest that early-life sleep is critically important for neurotypical behaviors in adolescence, a time where reward-seeking and risky behaviors are adaptive for learning and promoting survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reward-seeking behavior is frequently associated with risk of punishment. There are two types of punishment: positive, resulting in an unpleasant outcome, and negative, resulting in omission of a reinforcing outcome. Although the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important in avoiding punishment, whether it is important for avoiding both positive and negative punishment and how it contributes to such avoidance are not clear. In this study, we trained male mice to perform decision-making tasks under the risks of positive (air-puff stimulus) and negative (reward omission) punishment. We found that pharmacological inactivation of mPFC enhanced the reward-seeking choice under the risk of positive, but not negative, punishment. In reinforcement learning models, this behavioral change was well-explained by hypersensitivity to the reward, rather than a decrease in the strength of aversion to punishment. Our results suggest that mPFC suppresses reward-seeking behavior by reducing sensitivity to reward under the risk of positive punishment.</p>
