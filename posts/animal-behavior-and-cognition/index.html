Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.\nAggression: A gut reaction? The effects of gut microbiome on aggression\nAuthors: Uzan-Yulzari, A.; Turjeman, S.; Getselter, D.; Rautava, S.; Isolauri, E.; Khatib, S.; Elliott, E.; Koren, O.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564110\nRecent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science. One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.\nA state with increased arousal threshold in Araneus diadematus (Araneidae) measured in the wild: new evidence for sleep in spiders\nAuthors: Rössler, D. C.; Herberstein, M. E.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.19.563109\nSleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.\nFemale cichlids attack and avoid-but will still mate with-androgen receptor mutant males that lack male-typical body coloration\nAuthors: Howard, M.; Ramsaroop, M.; Hoadley, A.; Jackson, L.; Lopez, M.; Saenz, L.; Alward, B. A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565323\nA key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b+ cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b+ cells to coordinate behavioral output.\nKnowledge by omission: the significance of omissions in the 5-choice serial reaction time task\nAuthors: Vouillac, C.; Durand, A.; Ahmed, S. H.; Guillem, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565747\nThe 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.\nAging in zebrafish is associated with reduced locomotor activity and strain-dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety.\nAuthors: Hudock, J.; Kenney, J. W.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.565457\nAging is associated with a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes in many species. Like humans, zebrafish exhibit gradual senescence, and thus may be a useful model organism for identifying evolutionarily conserved mechanisms related to aging. Here, we compared behavior in the novel tank test of young (6-month-old) and middle aged (12-month-old) zebrafish from two strains (TL and TU) and both sexes. We find that this modest age difference results in a reduction in locomotor activity and strain dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety. Older TL fish have an elevation in bottom dwelling whereas older TU fish have a decrease in thigmotaxis. We found no consistent effects of age on either short-term (within session) or long-term (1 day later) habituation to the novel tank. Our findings support the use of zebrafish for the study of how age affects locomotion and how genetics interacts with age to alter the regulation of emotional behaviors in response to novelty.\nTowards Choice Engineering\nAuthors: Dan, O.; Plonsky, O.; Loewenstein, Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.04.565653\nEffectively shaping human and animal behavior has been of great practical and theoretical importance for millennia. Here we ask whether quantitative models of choice can be used to achieve this goal more effectively than qualitative psychological principles. We term this approach, which is motivated by the effectiveness of engineering in the natural sciences, choice engineering. To address this question, we launched an academic competition, in which the academic participants were instructed to use either quantitative models or qualitative principles to design reward schedules that maximally bias choice in a repeated, two-alternative task. We found that a choice engineering approach was the most successful method for shaping behavior in our task. This is a proof of concept that quantitative models are ripe to be used in order to engineer behavior. Finally, we show that choice engineering can be effectively used to compare models in the cognitive sciences, thus providing an alternative to the standard statistical methods of model comparison that are based on likelihood or explained variance.\nThe Effects of Flow Speeds on Smooth Pursuit Tracking and Active Sensing Movements of Weakly Electric Fish\nAuthors: AYDIN, E. Y.; Unlutabak, B.; Uyanik, I.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565374\nWeakly electric fish employ refuge-tracking behavior to survive, seeking and utilizing hiding places to shield themselves from predators and unfavorable environmental conditions. This adaptive mechanism enables them to minimize the risk of predation, maintain optimal electrocommunication, and adapt to changing surroundings. While studies have explored smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements of these fish in stationary environments, limited emphasis has been given to how varying flow speeds in their natural habitats may impact these behaviors. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of different flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements in weakly electric fish. Active sensing provides sensory data and multisensory integration processes and combines this data to create a holistic perception of the environment. The synergy between these processes is fundamental for enhancing an organisms sensory capabilities and enabling it to adapt and interact effectively with its surroundings. For this study, a specialized experimental setup was designed and built to facilitate refuge-tracking behavior under controlled flow conditions. The experiments involved Apteronotus albifrons fish exposed to visual and complex electrosensory stimuli, which consisted of a sum of sine signals. Data was recorded for different sensory conditions, including variations in flow speeds, illumination levels, and refuge structures. The analysis revealed that increased flow speeds correlated with reduced tracking gain and phase lag in the fish. Additionally, it was observed that active sensing movements were more pronounced in dark conditions. These findings highlight the significant impact of flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements and emphasize the importance of studying these behaviors within the context of water flow. Understanding the biological motivations underlying these effects is vital for their potential application in engineering fields.\nPredator Odor Stressor, 2,3,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT): Assessment of stress reactive behaviors during an animal model of traumatic stress in rats\nAuthors: Ornelas, L. C.; Besheer, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566080\nAnimal models utilizing predator odor stress are important in understanding implications for post-traumatic stress disorder. 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) has been used to measure stress reactive behaviors during TMT exposure, indicative of stress coping behaviors. In addition, long-term consequences of stress including contextual-induced stress memory, anxiety-like and hyperarousal behaviors, and subsequent increases in alcohol self-administration can also be examined after TMT exposure. In this article, we describe the TMT exposure protocol used in our lab and how we measure different stress-reactive behaviors that rats engage in during the TMT exposure. Rats are placed in Plexiglas chambers that contains white bedding on the bottom of the chamber and a metal basket in the top right corner that contains a filter paper on which 10 microliters of TMT is pipetted onto. During the 10 min exposure, rats can move around the chamber freely. Exposures are recorded by a video camera for later analysis. During TMT exposure, rats engage in a variety of stress-reactive behaviors, including digging and immobility behavior. These are two distinctly different types of stress-induced behavioral coping strategies to measure individual differences in stress responsivity. To examine individual differences, we group rats into TMT-subgroups based on time spent engaging in digging or immobility behavior. We calculate a digging/immobility ratio score in which we divide the total time spent digging by the total time spent immobile. A cut-off strategy is used such that rats with a criterion ratio score below 1.0 are classified as TMT-1 (i.e., low digging/high immobility; greater passive coping) and rats with a ratio score above 1.0 are classified as TMT-2 (i.e., high digging/low immobility; greater active coping). In the present paper, we provide a detailed description of the TMT exposure protocol and step-by-step process in evaluation of stress-reactive behaviors.\nForaging task specialization in honey bees (Apis mellifera): the contribution of floral rewards on the learning performance of pollen and nectar foragers\nAuthors: Moreno, E.; Arenas, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565788\nSocial insects live in communities where cooperative actions heavily rely on the individual cognitive abilities of their members. In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the specialization in nectar or pollen collection is associated with variations in gustatory sensitivity, affecting both associative and non-associative learning. Gustatory sensitivity fluctuates as a function of changes in motivation for the specific floral resource throughout the foraging cycle, yet differences in learning abilities between nectar and pollen foragers at the onset of recollection remains unexplored. Here, we examined nectar and pollen foragers captured upon arrival at food sources. We subjected them to an olfactory PER conditioning using a 10% sucrose solution paired (S10%+P) or unpaired (S10%) with pollen as a co-reinforcement. For non-associative learning, we habituated foragers with a 10% sucrose solution paired (S10%+P) or unpaired (S10%) with pollen, followed by dishabituation tests with either S50% or S10%+P. Our results indicate that pollen foragers show lower performance than nectar foragers when conditioned with S10%. Interestingly, performance improves to levels similar to those of nectar foragers when pollen is included as rewarding stimulus (S10%+P). In non-associative learning, pollen foragers tested with S10%+P displayed a lower degree of habituation than nectar foragers and a higher degree of dishabituation when pollen was used as the dishabituating stimulus (S10%+P). Altogether, our results support the idea that pollen and nectar honey bee foragers differ in their perception of rewards, leading to inter-individual differences in learning that contribute to foraging specialization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Being photosynthetic sessile organisms, plants established heliotropism to track the suns position across the sky and allow their vegetative parts to orient accordingly. Here, we report plant-like heliotropic movement in a photosymbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Like plants, photosynthesis represents a key energy source in endosymbiotic cnidarians bearing microalgae. We observed that A. viridis in their natural habitats under sunlight displayed heliotropism or solar tracking by pointing their tentacles towards the sun while remaining sessile, facing east at dawn and west at dusk as they track the suns relative position through the day, a phenomenon previously only observed in plants. Solar tracking movements in A. viridis are driven by a light wavelength that prompts photosynthesis in their endosymbionts. The heliotropic response was absent in both bleached (aposymbiotic) A. viridis and in symbiotic A. viridis with chemically inhibited photosynthesis. We revealed a direct correlation between heliotropism and endosymbiont oxygen production in A. viridis. Our findings suggest that photosymbiotic A. viridis has likely evolved plant-like heliotropism as an effective way to modulate exposure to solar irradiation for photosynthesis. The study exemplifies how photosynthetic organisms such as plants and photosymbiotic sea anemones, display similar behaviour in response to similar environmental pressures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent research has unveiled conflicting evidence regarding the link between aggression and the gut microbiome. In our investigation, we meticulously examined the behavioral patterns of four groups of mice - wild-type, germ-free (GF), mice treated with antibiotics, and recolonized GF mice - to gain mechanistic insights into the impact of the gut microbiome on aggression. We discovered a significant correlation between diminished microbiome and increased aggression. Importantly, this behavioral shift could be restored when a WT microbiota was reinstated. Microbiota manipulation also significantly altered brain function, particularly in aggression-associated genes, and urine metabolite profiles. Notably, our study extends beyond the murine model, shedding light on clinical implications of early-life antibiotic exposure. We found that fecal microbiome transplants from 1mo old infants prescribed antibiotics during their first days of life led to a marked increase in aggression in recipient mice. This research demonstrates that the microbiota modulates aggression and underscores its importance in the realm of behavioral science.

One-Sentence SummaryThe antibiotic-altered gut microbiome is implicated in increased aggression. It also leads to altered brain function, particularly in genes linked to aggression, and urine metabolite profiles showing a multi-system response to microbiota disruption.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sleep is a seemingly universal behavior across the animal kingdom, yet for the majority of species, experimental evidence thereof is still lacking. The recent report of REM sleep-like behavior in a jumping spider has highlighted the potential of spiders as a non-model organism to study invertebrate sleep. While behavioral evidence of potential sleep-states in spiders is strong, a crucial piece of evidence is so far lacking: a shift in arousability during sleep compared to awake states. Targeting a spider exquisitely suited for conducting experiments in the wild, we collected arousal threshold data for the diurnal orb-web spider Araneus diadematus. Our field experiments revealed significant differences in response latency between day- and night-times. Using a sound stimulus of 400 Hz with increasing amplitude that robustly triggers an anti-predatory response (raising of front legs), we tested both immobile and active spiders during the day and during the night. We found that spiders had a significantly longer response latency to the stimulus during nighttime immobility compared to immobile spiders during the day. There was no difference in the response latency between active spiders at night and active spiders during the day. Overall, our data demonstrate a shift in arousability during periods of night-time immobility in support of sleep in A. diadematus. Additionally, however, we found eight spiders that did not respond to the stimulus within the set time limit, most of which we encountered during daytime immobility hinting at additional sleep behavior during the day and a potential bimodal sleep pattern. Our study, along with recent work on jumping spider sleep-like behavior showcases the suitability of spiders for sleep research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in animal behavior is disentangling the social stimuli that drive conspecific behaviors. For behaviors like birdsong, insights can be made through the experimental isolation of relevant cues that affect behavior. However, for some species like teleost fish, putative sexual signaling cues are inextricably linked to others, making it difficult to parse the precise roles distinct signals play in driving conspecific behaviors. In the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, males are dominant or subordinate, wherein bright coloration and territorial and courtship behavior inextricably correlate positively with rank. Here, we leveraged androgen receptor (AR) mutant male A. burtoni that lack dominance-typical coloration but not behavior to isolate the role of male coloration in driving female mating behaviors in this species. We found in independent behavioral assays that females behave aggressively towards AR mutant but not WT males but still mated with both types of males. Females showed enhanced activation of esr2b&#43; cells in the hypothalamus when housed with either mutant or WT males and this activation scaled with spawning activities. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between male coloration and female mating behaviors in A. burtoni, suggesting independent sensory mechanisms converge on hypothalamic esr2b&#43; cells to coordinate behavioral output.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is commonly used to assess attention in rodents. Manipulation of this task by decreasing the light stimulus duration is often used to probe attentional capacity and causes a decrease in accuracy and an increase in omissions. However, although a decrease in response accuracy is commonly interpreted as a decrease in attention, it is more difficult to interpret an increase in omissions in terms of attentional performance. Here we present a series of experiments in rats that seeks to investigate the origins of these key behavioral measures of attention in the 5-CSRTT. After an initial training in the 5-CSRTT, rats were tested in a variable stimulus duration procedure to increase task difficulty and probe visual attentional capacity under several specific controlled conditions. We found that response accuracy reflects visuospatial sustained attentional processing, as commonly interpreted, while response omission reflects rats ignorance about the stimulus location, presumably due to failure to pay attention to the curved wall during its presentation. Moreover, when rats lack of relevant information, they choose not to respond instead of responding randomly. Overall, our results indicate that response accuracy and response omission thus correspond to two distinct attentional states.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging is associated with a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes in many species. Like humans, zebrafish exhibit gradual senescence, and thus may be a useful model organism for identifying evolutionarily conserved mechanisms related to aging. Here, we compared behavior in the novel tank test of young (6-month-old) and middle aged (12-month-old) zebrafish from two strains (TL and TU) and both sexes. We find that this modest age difference results in a reduction in locomotor activity and strain dependent changes in predator avoidance behaviors related to anxiety. Older TL fish have an elevation in bottom dwelling whereas older TU fish have a decrease in thigmotaxis. We found no consistent effects of age on either short-term (within session) or long-term (1 day later) habituation to the novel tank. Our findings support the use of zebrafish for the study of how age affects locomotion and how genetics interacts with age to alter the regulation of emotional behaviors in response to novelty.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Effectively shaping human and animal behavior has been of great practical and theoretical importance for millennia. Here we ask whether quantitative models of choice can be used to achieve this goal more effectively than qualitative psychological principles. We term this approach, which is motivated by the effectiveness of engineering in the natural sciences,  choice engineering. To address this question, we launched an academic competition, in which the academic participants were instructed to use either quantitative models or qualitative principles to design reward schedules that maximally bias choice in a repeated, two-alternative task. We found that a choice engineering approach was the most successful method for shaping behavior in our task. This is a proof of concept that quantitative models are ripe to be used in order to engineer behavior. Finally, we show that choice engineering can be effectively used to compare models in the cognitive sciences, thus providing an alternative to the standard statistical methods of model comparison that are based on likelihood or explained variance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Weakly electric fish employ refuge-tracking behavior to survive, seeking and utilizing hiding places to shield themselves from predators and unfavorable environmental conditions. This adaptive mechanism enables them to minimize the risk of predation, maintain optimal electrocommunication, and adapt to changing surroundings. While studies have explored smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements of these fish in stationary environments, limited emphasis has been given to how varying flow speeds in their natural habitats may impact these behaviors. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of different flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements in weakly electric fish. Active sensing provides sensory data and multisensory integration processes and combines this data to create a holistic perception of the environment. The synergy between these processes is fundamental for enhancing an organisms sensory capabilities and enabling it to adapt and interact effectively with its surroundings. For this study, a specialized experimental setup was designed and built to facilitate refuge-tracking behavior under controlled flow conditions. The experiments involved Apteronotus albifrons fish exposed to visual and complex electrosensory stimuli, which consisted of a sum of sine signals. Data was recorded for different sensory conditions, including variations in flow speeds, illumination levels, and refuge structures. The analysis revealed that increased flow speeds correlated with reduced tracking gain and phase lag in the fish. Additionally, it was observed that active sensing movements were more pronounced in dark conditions. These findings highlight the significant impact of flow speeds on smooth pursuit tracking and active sensing movements and emphasize the importance of studying these behaviors within the context of water flow. Understanding the biological motivations underlying these effects is vital for their potential application in engineering fields.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal models utilizing predator odor stress are important in understanding implications for post-traumatic stress disorder. 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) has been used to measure stress reactive behaviors during TMT exposure, indicative of stress coping behaviors. In addition, long-term consequences of stress including contextual-induced stress memory, anxiety-like and hyperarousal behaviors, and subsequent increases in alcohol self-administration can also be examined after TMT exposure. In this article, we describe the TMT exposure protocol used in our lab and how we measure different stress-reactive behaviors that rats engage in during the TMT exposure. Rats are placed in Plexiglas chambers that contains white bedding on the bottom of the chamber and a metal basket in the top right corner that contains a filter paper on which 10 microliters of TMT is pipetted onto. During the 10 min exposure, rats can move around the chamber freely. Exposures are recorded by a video camera for later analysis. During TMT exposure, rats engage in a variety of stress-reactive behaviors, including digging and immobility behavior. These are two distinctly different types of stress-induced behavioral coping strategies to measure individual differences in stress responsivity. To examine individual differences, we group rats into TMT-subgroups based on time spent engaging in digging or immobility behavior. We calculate a digging/immobility ratio score in which we divide the total time spent digging by the total time spent immobile. A cut-off strategy is used such that rats with a criterion ratio score below 1.0 are classified as TMT-1 (i.e., low digging/high immobility; greater passive coping) and rats with a ratio score above 1.0 are classified as TMT-2 (i.e., high digging/low immobility; greater active coping). In the present paper, we provide a detailed description of the TMT exposure protocol and step-by-step process in evaluation of stress-reactive behaviors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social insects live in communities where cooperative actions heavily rely on the individual cognitive abilities of their members. In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), the specialization in nectar or pollen collection is associated with variations in gustatory sensitivity, affecting both associative and non-associative learning. Gustatory sensitivity fluctuates as a function of changes in motivation for the specific floral resource throughout the foraging cycle, yet differences in learning abilities between nectar and pollen foragers at the onset of recollection remains unexplored. Here, we examined nectar and pollen foragers captured upon arrival at food sources. We subjected them to an olfactory PER conditioning using a 10% sucrose solution paired (S10%&#43;P) or unpaired (S10%) with pollen as a co-reinforcement. For non-associative learning, we habituated foragers with a 10% sucrose solution paired (S10%&#43;P) or unpaired (S10%) with pollen, followed by dishabituation tests with either S50% or S10%&#43;P. Our results indicate that pollen foragers show lower performance than nectar foragers when conditioned with S10%. Interestingly, performance improves to levels similar to those of nectar foragers when pollen is included as rewarding stimulus (S10%&#43;P). In non-associative learning, pollen foragers tested with S10%&#43;P displayed a lower degree of habituation than nectar foragers and a higher degree of dishabituation when pollen was used as the dishabituating stimulus (S10%&#43;P). Altogether, our results support the idea that pollen and nectar honey bee foragers differ in their perception of rewards, leading to inter-individual differences in learning that contribute to foraging specialization.</p>
