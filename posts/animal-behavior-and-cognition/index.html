Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.\nA densely sampled and richly annotated acoustic dataset from a wild bird population\nAuthors: Merino Recalde, N.; Estandia, A.; Pichot, L.; Vansse, A.; Cole, E. F.; Sheldon, B. C.\nScore: 51.5, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547484\nWe present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.\nEnhanced long-term memory and increased mushroom body plasticity in Heliconius butterflies\nAuthors: Young, F. J.; Alcalde, A.; Melo-Florez, L.; Couto, A.; Foley, J.; Monllor, M.; McMillan, W. O.; Montgomery, S. H.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548546\nAs highly labile structures on both individual and evolutionary time scales, the mushroom bodies, a key site of learning and memory in insects, are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of cognitive variation. We explored the behavioural consequences of mushroom body expansion in Heliconius butterflies, which possess greatly expanded mushroom bodies relative to their closest outgroups. We conducted long-term visual memory assays across three Heliconius and three other Heliconiini species using trained food-colour associations. We confirm robust differences between clades, with Heliconius exhibiting greater fidelity to the trained colour after 8 days without reinforcement compared to other Heliconiini, with further evidence of stable preferences at 13 days. We extended this analysis to consider the plastic response of the mushroom body calyces over this time period, measuring the volume of the mushroom body calyx, and the number of neurons and synapses it contains. We find substantial post-eclosion expansion and synaptic pruning in calyx of Heliconius erato, but not in Dryas iulia. In Heliconius erato, visual associative learning experience specifically is associated with a greater retention of calyceal synapses. At an individual level, fidelity to the trained colour in Heliconius erato was also positively correlated with synapse number. These results point to an enhanced visual long-term memory across Heliconius, facilitated not only by phylogenetic expansion of the mushroom body, but also changes in its developmental response to learning experience. The co-evolution of mushroom body expansion, plasticity and specific behaviours provides an important case study in the evolution of cognition.\nContributions of associative and non-associative learning to the dynamics of defensive ethograms\nAuthors: Le, Q.-S. E.; Hereford, D.; Borkar, C. D.; Aldaco, Z.; Klar, J.; Resendez, A.; Fadok, J. P.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-07-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547975\nDefensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses are currently unclear given the reductionist behavior elicited by most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. To investigate defensive ethograms more thoroughly, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6J mice to a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm that pairs footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared the paired SCS-footshock group with control groups that either received randomly presented SCS and footshock presentations (unpaired) or received only footshocks during conditioning (shock-only). After conditioning, only the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive flight responses comprised of jumping and darting behavior during the WN period. The unpaired group expressed no cue-induced freezing and significantly less freezing overall. Furthermore, the unpaired group reduced freezing but rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, only the paired group decreased tone-induced freezing. During WN, the paired group rapidly transitioned from escape jumping to freezing and darting. Comparatively, the unpaired and shock-only groups displayed stress-induced tail rattling to SCS, eschewing freezing and jumping. These findings demonstrate that while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, associative pairings are required for robust cue-induced freezing and flight expression.\nEndocannabinoid system modulation alters fine motor behavior in mice: insights from 3D motion capture\nAuthors: Ignatowska-Jankowska, B. M.; Gurkan Ozer, A.; Kuck, A.; Niphakis, M. J.; Ogasawara, D.; Cravatt, B. F.; Uusisaari, M. Y.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546437\nThe neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.\nDissociable encoding of motivated behavior by parallel thalamo-striatal projections\nAuthors: Beas, S.; Khan, I.; Gao, C.; MacDonnolad, E.; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, S.; Penzo, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548113\nThe successful pursuit of goals requires the coordinated execution and termination of actions that lead to positive outcomes. This process is thought to rely on motivational states that are guided by internal drivers, such as hunger or fear. However, the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions are not fully understood. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a midline thalamic nucleus that shapes motivated behaviors via its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (1-9) and monitors internal state via interoceptive inputs from the hypothalamus and brainstem (10-14). Recent studies have revealed two major PVT neuronal subpopulations, Type1PVT and Type2PVT, which differ in genetic identity, functionality, and anatomical connectivity to other brain regions, including the NAc (15-17). In this study, we used fiber photometry to investigate the in vivo dynamics of these two distinct PVT neuronal types in mice performing a reward foraging task. We discovered that Type1PVT and Type2PVT neurons encode the execution and termination of goal-oriented actions, respectively. Furthermore, unlike Type2PVT cells, activity in the Type1PVT neuronal population mirrored motivation parameters such as vigor and satiety. Interestingly, these features were largely preserved when activity in PVT projections to the NAc was selectively assessed. Collectively, our results highlight the existence of two parallel thalamo-striatal projections that participate in the dynamic regulation of goal pursuits and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions.\nSpontaneous helping in pigs is mediated by helper's social attention and distress signals of individuals in need\nAuthors: Moscovice, L. R.; Eggert, A.; Manteuffel, C.; Rault, J.-L.\nScore: 90.9, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.17.533160\nHelping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.\nLasting dynamic effects of the psychedelic 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (+/-)-DOI) on cognitive flexibility\nAuthors: Sabanovic, M.; Lazari, A.; Blanco-Pozo, M.; Lerch, J. P.; Walton, M. E.; Bannerman, D. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547771\nPsychedelic drugs can aid fast and lasting remission from various neuropsychiatric disorders, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Preclinical studies suggest serotonergic psychedelics enhance neuronal plasticity, but whether neuroplastic changes can also be seen at cognitive and behavioural levels is unexplored. Here we show that a single dose of the psychedelic 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (({+/-})-DOI) affects structural brain plasticity and cognitive flexibility in young adult mice beyond the acute drug experience. Using ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, we show increased volumes of several sensory and association areas one day after systemic administration of 2mgkg-1 ({+/-})-DOI. We then demonstrate lasting effects of ({+/-})-DOI on cognitive flexibility in a two-step probabilistic reversal learning task where 2mgkg-1 ({+/-})-DOI improved the rate of adaptation to a novel reversal in task structure occurring one-week post-treatment. Strikingly, ({+/-})-DOI-treated mice started learning from reward omissions, a unique strategy not typically seen in mice in this task, suggesting heightened sensitivity to previously overlooked cues. Crucially, further experiments revealed that ({+/-})-DOIs effects on cognitive flexibility were contingent on the timing between drug treatment and the novel reversal, as well as on the nature of the intervening experience. ({+/-})-DOIs facilitation of both cognitive adaptation and novel thinking strategies may contribute to the clinical benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, particularly in cases of perseverative behaviours and a resistance to change seen in depression, anxiety, or addiction. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial role of time-dependent neuroplasticity and the influence of experiential factors in shaping the therapeutic potential of psychedelic interventions for impaired cognitive flexibility.\nLeadership and information transfer in groups escaping a (simulated) threat in the wild\nAuthors: Rathore, A.; Vadavalli, B. D.; Jadhav, V.; Isvaran, K.; Guttal, V.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547602\nCollective motion in many species is believed to be driven by predation, which is considered a crucial evolutionary force. However, there are limited studies on how information about predators spreads through a group, particularly in natural settings. Here, using high-resolution drone-based recordings, we analyze the collective escape dynamics of a group living species - blackbuck (Antilope cervicara), an Indian antelope - under the conditions of a simulated threat in their natural grassland habitat. Our analysis reveals that, in response to the simulated threat, group cohesion first increases, followed by a simultaneous increase in median speed and polarization. We also observe the emergence of a temporary leader-follower relationship during the collective escape. Interestingly, we found that the distance of individuals from the \"predator\" affected only their response time, not their influence on the group movement. The individuals furthest from the threat were the least likely to initiate movement and were uncoordinated with the groups speed. Additionally, we discovered that the most influential individuals during the collective escape were the least likely to occupy front positions during group movement. Instead, our results indicate that individuals at the rear \"push\" individuals at the front during collective escape events. This contrasts with the typical notion of individuals at the front determining group movement and those at the back trying to catch up.\nEfficient numerosity estimation under limited time\nAuthors: Heng, J. A.; Woodford, M.; Polania, R.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547493\nThe ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. Despite its importance, the rapid representation and estimation of numerosity is surprisingly imprecise and biased. However, a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.\n",

Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We present a high-resolution, densely-sampled dataset of wild bird songs collected over multiple years from a single population of Great Tits (Parus major) in the UK. The dataset includes over 1,100,000 individual acoustic units from 109,963 richly annotated songs, sung by more than 400 individual birds, and provides unprecedented detail on the vocal behaviour of wild birds. Here, we describe the data collection and processing procedures and provide a summary of the data. We also discuss potential research questions that can be addressed using this dataset, including behavioural repeatability and stability, links between vocal performance and reproductive success, the timing of song production, syntactic organisation of song production, and song learning in the wild. We have made the dataset and associated software tools publicly available with the aim that other researchers can benefit from this resource and use it to further our understanding of bird vocal behaviour in the wild.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As highly labile structures on both individual and evolutionary time scales, the mushroom bodies, a key site of learning and memory in insects, are an excellent model for investigating the evolution of cognitive variation. We explored the behavioural consequences of mushroom body expansion in Heliconius butterflies, which possess greatly expanded mushroom bodies relative to their closest outgroups. We conducted long-term visual memory assays across three Heliconius and three other Heliconiini species using trained food-colour associations. We confirm robust differences between clades, with Heliconius exhibiting greater fidelity to the trained colour after 8 days without reinforcement compared to other Heliconiini, with further evidence of stable preferences at 13 days. We extended this analysis to consider the plastic response of the mushroom body calyces over this time period, measuring the volume of the mushroom body calyx, and the number of neurons and synapses it contains. We find substantial post-eclosion expansion and synaptic pruning in calyx of Heliconius erato, but not in Dryas iulia. In Heliconius erato, visual associative learning experience specifically is associated with a greater retention of calyceal synapses. At an individual level, fidelity to the trained colour in Heliconius erato was also positively correlated with synapse number. These results point to an enhanced visual long-term memory across Heliconius, facilitated not only by phylogenetic expansion of the mushroom body, but also changes in its developmental response to learning experience. The co-evolution of mushroom body expansion, plasticity and specific behaviours provides an important case study in the evolution of cognition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses are currently unclear given the reductionist behavior elicited by most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. To investigate defensive ethograms more thoroughly, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6J mice to a Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm that pairs footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared the paired SCS-footshock group with control groups that either received randomly presented SCS and footshock presentations (unpaired) or received only footshocks during conditioning (shock-only). After conditioning, only the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive flight responses comprised of jumping and darting behavior during the WN period. The unpaired group expressed no cue-induced freezing and significantly less freezing overall. Furthermore, the unpaired group reduced freezing but rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, only the paired group decreased tone-induced freezing. During WN, the paired group rapidly transitioned from escape jumping to freezing and darting. Comparatively, the unpaired and shock-only groups displayed stress-induced tail rattling to SCS, eschewing freezing and jumping. These findings demonstrate that while non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, associative pairings are required for robust cue-induced freezing and flight expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The successful pursuit of goals requires the coordinated execution and termination of actions that lead to positive outcomes. This process is thought to rely on motivational states that are guided by internal drivers, such as hunger or fear. However, the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions are not fully understood. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is a midline thalamic nucleus that shapes motivated behaviors via its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (1-9) and monitors internal state via interoceptive inputs from the hypothalamus and brainstem (10-14). Recent studies have revealed two major PVT neuronal subpopulations, Type1PVT and Type2PVT, which differ in genetic identity, functionality, and anatomical connectivity to other brain regions, including the NAc (15-17). In this study, we used fiber photometry to investigate the in vivo dynamics of these two distinct PVT neuronal types in mice performing a reward foraging task. We discovered that Type1PVT and Type2PVT neurons encode the execution and termination of goal-oriented actions, respectively. Furthermore, unlike Type2PVT cells, activity in the Type1PVT neuronal population mirrored motivation parameters such as vigor and satiety. Interestingly, these features were largely preserved when activity in PVT projections to the NAc was selectively assessed. Collectively, our results highlight the existence of two parallel thalamo-striatal projections that participate in the dynamic regulation of goal pursuits and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the brain tracks motivational states to shape instrumental actions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Helping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a five-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 minutes (median latency = 2.2 minutes). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the test compartment were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Psychedelic drugs can aid fast and lasting remission from various neuropsychiatric disorders, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Preclinical studies suggest serotonergic psychedelics enhance neuronal plasticity, but whether neuroplastic changes can also be seen at cognitive and behavioural levels is unexplored. Here we show that a single dose of the psychedelic 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (({&#43;/-})-DOI) affects structural brain plasticity and cognitive flexibility in young adult mice beyond the acute drug experience. Using ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging, we show increased volumes of several sensory and association areas one day after systemic administration of 2mgkg-1 ({&#43;/-})-DOI. We then demonstrate lasting effects of ({&#43;/-})-DOI on cognitive flexibility in a two-step probabilistic reversal learning task where 2mgkg-1 ({&#43;/-})-DOI improved the rate of adaptation to a novel reversal in task structure occurring one-week post-treatment. Strikingly, ({&#43;/-})-DOI-treated mice started learning from reward omissions, a unique strategy not typically seen in mice in this task, suggesting heightened sensitivity to previously overlooked cues. Crucially, further experiments revealed that ({&#43;/-})-DOIs effects on cognitive flexibility were contingent on the timing between drug treatment and the novel reversal, as well as on the nature of the intervening experience. ({&#43;/-})-DOIs facilitation of both cognitive adaptation and novel thinking strategies may contribute to the clinical benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, particularly in cases of perseverative behaviours and a resistance to change seen in depression, anxiety, or addiction. Furthermore, our findings highlight the crucial role of time-dependent neuroplasticity and the influence of experiential factors in shaping the therapeutic potential of psychedelic interventions for impaired cognitive flexibility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Collective motion in many species is believed to be driven by predation, which is considered a crucial evolutionary force. However, there are limited studies on how information about predators spreads through a group, particularly in natural settings. Here, using high-resolution drone-based recordings, we analyze the collective escape dynamics of a group living species - blackbuck (Antilope cervicara), an Indian antelope - under the conditions of a simulated threat in their natural grassland habitat. Our analysis reveals that, in response to the simulated threat, group cohesion first increases, followed by a simultaneous increase in median speed and polarization. We also observe the emergence of a temporary leader-follower relationship during the collective escape. Interestingly, we found that the distance of individuals from the &#34;predator&#34; affected only their response time, not their influence on the group movement. The individuals furthest from the threat were the least likely to initiate movement and were uncoordinated with the groups speed. Additionally, we discovered that the most influential individuals during the collective escape were the least likely to occupy front positions during group movement. Instead, our results indicate that individuals at the rear &#34;push&#34; individuals at the front during collective escape events. This contrasts with the typical notion of individuals at the front determining group movement and those at the back trying to catch up.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. Despite its importance, the rapid representation and estimation of numerosity is surprisingly imprecise and biased. However, a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory estimations, logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.</p>
