In treatment, avoidance behaviors are typically discouraged because they are assumed to maintain anxiety. Yet, it is not clear that engaging in avoidance is always detrimental. In this study, we used a platform-mediated avoidance task to investigate the influence of avoidance history on extinction learning in male rats. Our results show that having the opportunity to avoid during fear acquisition training has no marked effect on the extinction of auditory cued fear in a platform-mediated avoidance procedure that constitutes a realistic approach/avoidance conflict in male rats, regardless of whether avoidance was possible during extinction or not. This suggests that imposing a realistic cost on avoidance behavior prevents the adverse effects that avoidance has been claimed to have on extinction, but even then, avoidance does not appear to have clear positive effects on extinction learning nor on retention either\nFlexibility of tandem leaders resolves traffic jams during colony relocation in an ant\nAuthors: Pathak, M. K.; Annagiri, S.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557616\nAnts, renowned for their intricate social behaviors, exhibit remarkable collective movement patterns that enable them to forage and tunnel efficiently. Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.\nBreeding alters females' social positions by changing dominance dynamics\nAuthors: Dehnen, T.; Nyaguthii, B.; Cherono, W.; Boogert, N. J.; Farine, D. R.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.558583\nAgonistic and affiliative interactions with group members dictate individuals' access to resources, and investment in competing for resources is often traded off with other needs. For example, reproductive investment can reduce body condition and, thereby, an individual's ability to win future agonistic interactions. However, group members may also alter their behaviour towards reproductive individuals, such as becoming more or less aggressive. Here, we investigated the social consequences of reproduction in female vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, a plural breeder in which females disperse and are subordinate to males. We found opposing patterns for breeders' within- and between-sex dominance interactions from before to after breeding. Specifically, while breeding females became far less likely to win dominance interactions with non-breeding females after breeding than before breeding, they received considerably fewer male aggressions than non-breeding females after breeding. Using agent-based models, we then show that hierarchies inferred using the Percolation and Conductance method are robust to such variation in interaction rates, while other common methods may be prone to systematically overestimating or underestimating particular individuals' hierarchy positions. Our study highlights reproduction as a driver of dominance dynamics, and illustrates how the study of dominance may benefit from considering variation in interaction rates.\nValidation of a Radio frequency identification system for tracking location of laying hens in a quasi-commercial aviary system\nAuthors: Gebhardt-Henrich, S. G.; Kashev, A.; Petelle, M. B.; Toscano, M. J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-09-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.16.528820\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCage-free housing is increasingly chosen in Europe, North America, and Australia as an animal-welfare friendly farm system for laying hens. However, hens are kept in large numbers in those systems which makes checking for health and welfare difficult and individuals cannot be identified. Tracking systems like radio frequency identification allow researchers to monitor these individuals almost continuously. Individual tracking data has revealed substantial individual variation in movement patterns, however, in recent studies, only a subset of animals per flock was tracked. We applied an RFID tracking system to monitor all 1125 laying hens of a flock, which were divided into 5 pens of 225 birds each in a barn with an aviary system. In each pen, 26 antennas were placed on the edges of three tiers and in the litter. For validation purposes, 3 hens in 2 connected pens were fitted with colored backpacks. They were recorded on video and their location throughout the pen was taken from the video and compared with registrations from the RFID system. For 93% of compared transitions, the RFID data matched the observational data regarding the tier or litter whereas the value fell to 39% for specific antennae. When the antennae on the litter were excluded for the validation, the match on tier-level was at least 98% but on antenna-level it remained lower than 50%. The sensitivity of the detection of tiers/litter but not antennae differed among the three hens. We conclude that the RFID tracking system was suitable for studying the movement pattern of individual hens among tiers in an aviary system in a reliable way but tracking birds on the litter needs to be improved.\nEye-specific detection and a multi-eye integration model of biological motion perception\nAuthors: De Agro, M.; Rössler, D. C.; Shamble, P. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559175\nThe term biological motion refers to the peculiar kinematics of living organisms. Their interconnected joints move at a fixed distance from each other, a pattern that is common among all locomotive, rigid animals. Across the animal kingdom, many species have developed specialized circuitry to visually recognize biologically moving stimuli and discriminate them from other patterns. Recently, this skill has also been observed in the distributed visual system of jumping spiders. These eight-eyed animals use three of their eye pairs to perceive motion. Then, the gaze of the remaining pair is shifted towards the detected object for further inspection. When presented with a biologically moving stimulus and a random one, jumping spiders turn to face the latter, demonstrating discrimination. In the current paper, we systematically tested the ability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from random displays using every single eye-pair, by blocking the others with paint. The animals were able to discriminate the stimuli only when the anterior-lateral eyes were unblocked, performing at chance level with the other pairs. Crucially, the spiders preferred the biological stimulus, not the random one. To explain this preference reversal we hypothesized a model, describing how the anterior-lateral eyes' specialization in detecting biological motion feeds into a multi-eye integration system, generating more complex behavior from the combination of the simple, single-eye responses. We propose that this in-built modularity may be a solution to the limited resources of these invertebrates' brains, constituting a novel approach to visual processing.\nDynamic vocal learning in adult marmoset monkeys\nAuthors: Phaniraj, N.; Wierucka, K.; Burkart, J. M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559020\nWhile vocal learning is vital to language acquisition in children, adults continue to adjust their speech while adapting to different social environments in the form of social vocal accommodation (SVA). Even though adult and infant vocal learning seemingly differ in their properties, whether the mechanisms underlying them differ remains unknown. The complex structure of language creates a challenge in quantifying vocal changes during SVA. Consequently, animals with simpler vocal communication systems are powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying SVA. Here, we tracked acoustic changes in the vocalizations of adult common marmoset pairs, a highly vocal primate species known to show SVA, for up to 85 days after pairing with a new partner. We identified four properties of SVA in marmosets: (1) bidirectional learning, (2) exponential decrease in vocal distance with time, (3) sensitivity to initial vocal distance, and (4) dyadic acoustic feature synchrony. We developed a mathematical model that shows all four properties. The model suggests that marmosets continuously update the memory of their partners' vocalizations and modify their own vocalizations to match them, a dynamic form of vocal learning. The model provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying SVA in adult animals and how they might differ from infant vocal learning.\nThe Egg-Counter: A novel microfluidic platform for characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying\nAuthors: Banse, S. A.; Jarrett, C. M.; Robinson, K. J.; Blue, B. W.; Shaw, E. L.; Phillips, P. C.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555781\nReproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Ants, renowned for their intricate social behaviors, exhibit remarkable collective movement patterns that enable them to forage and tunnel efficiently. Despite significant research into their navigation skills and traffic avoidance mechanisms mostly in the context of central-place foraging, the dynamics of bi-directional movement during colony relocation remains an underexplored domain. This study delves into the behavior of Diacamma indicum, an ant species, that recruits by tandem running during the relocation of their nest. Our findings reveal that constricted pathway linking the old and new nests lead to frequent interruptions and traffic jams, and this significantly extended transportation durations when compared to control. Through analysis of 56 traffic jam instances, we unveil the adaptability of tandem leaders. Their decisions on recruiting followers midway and adjusting heading directions amalgamates into emergent mass orientation towards the new nest acting as critical factors in untangling the traffic jam. This study not only illuminates the intricacies of collective ant movement during nest relocation but also unveils insights into the mechanisms that underscore their exceptional traffic jam mitigation abilities. By addressing this uncharted aspect of ant behavior, we contribute to a broader comprehension of the remarkable strategies these superorganisms employ to navigate complex environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Agonistic and affiliative interactions with group members dictate individuals&#39; access to resources, and investment in competing for resources is often traded off with other needs. For example, reproductive investment can reduce body condition and, thereby, an individual&#39;s ability to win future agonistic interactions. However, group members may also alter their behaviour towards reproductive individuals, such as becoming more or less aggressive. Here, we investigated the social consequences of reproduction in female vulturine guineafowl Acryllium vulturinum, a plural breeder in which females disperse and are subordinate to males. We found opposing patterns for breeders&#39; within- and between-sex dominance interactions from before to after breeding. Specifically, while breeding females became far less likely to win dominance interactions with non-breeding females after breeding than before breeding, they received considerably fewer male aggressions than non-breeding females after breeding. Using agent-based models, we then show that hierarchies inferred using the Percolation and Conductance method are robust to such variation in interaction rates, while other common methods may be prone to systematically overestimating or underestimating particular individuals&#39; hierarchy positions. Our study highlights reproduction as a driver of dominance dynamics, and illustrates how the study of dominance may benefit from considering variation in interaction rates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCage-free housing is increasingly chosen in Europe, North America, and Australia as an animal-welfare friendly farm system for laying hens. However, hens are kept in large numbers in those systems which makes checking for health and welfare difficult and individuals cannot be identified. Tracking systems like radio frequency identification allow researchers to monitor these individuals almost continuously. Individual tracking data has revealed substantial individual variation in movement patterns, however, in recent studies, only a subset of animals per flock was tracked. We applied an RFID tracking system to monitor all 1125 laying hens of a flock, which were divided into 5 pens of 225 birds each in a barn with an aviary system. In each pen, 26 antennas were placed on the edges of three tiers and in the litter. For validation purposes, 3 hens in 2 connected pens were fitted with colored backpacks. They were recorded on video and their location throughout the pen was taken from the video and compared with registrations from the RFID system. For 93% of compared transitions, the RFID data matched the observational data regarding the tier or litter whereas the value fell to 39% for specific antennae. When the antennae on the litter were excluded for the validation, the match on tier-level was at least 98% but on antenna-level it remained lower than 50%. The sensitivity of the detection of tiers/litter but not antennae differed among the three hens. We conclude that the RFID tracking system was suitable for studying the movement pattern of individual hens among tiers in an aviary system in a reliable way but tracking birds on the litter needs to be improved.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The term biological motion refers to the peculiar kinematics of living organisms. Their interconnected joints move at a fixed distance from each other, a pattern that is common among all locomotive, rigid animals. Across the animal kingdom, many species have developed specialized circuitry to visually recognize biologically moving stimuli and discriminate them from other patterns. Recently, this skill has also been observed in the distributed visual system of jumping spiders. These eight-eyed animals use three of their eye pairs to perceive motion. Then, the gaze of the remaining pair is shifted towards the detected object for further inspection. When presented with a biologically moving stimulus and a random one, jumping spiders turn to face the latter, demonstrating discrimination. In the current paper, we systematically tested the ability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from random displays using every single eye-pair, by blocking the others with paint. The animals were able to discriminate the stimuli only when the anterior-lateral eyes were unblocked, performing at chance level with the other pairs. Crucially, the spiders preferred the biological stimulus, not the random one. To explain this preference reversal we hypothesized a model, describing how the anterior-lateral eyes&#39; specialization in detecting biological motion feeds into a multi-eye integration system, generating more complex behavior from the combination of the simple, single-eye responses. We propose that this in-built modularity may be a solution to the limited resources of these invertebrates&#39; brains, constituting a novel approach to visual processing.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While vocal learning is vital to language acquisition in children, adults continue to adjust their speech while adapting to different social environments in the form of social vocal accommodation (SVA). Even though adult and infant vocal learning seemingly differ in their properties, whether the mechanisms underlying them differ remains unknown. The complex structure of language creates a challenge in quantifying vocal changes during SVA. Consequently, animals with simpler vocal communication systems are powerful tools for understanding the mechanisms underlying SVA. Here, we tracked acoustic changes in the vocalizations of adult common marmoset pairs, a highly vocal primate species known to show SVA, for up to 85 days after pairing with a new partner. We identified four properties of SVA in marmosets: (1) bidirectional learning, (2) exponential decrease in vocal distance with time, (3) sensitivity to initial vocal distance, and (4) dyadic acoustic feature synchrony. We developed a mathematical model that shows all four properties. The model suggests that marmosets continuously update the memory of their partners&#39; vocalizations and modify their own vocalizations to match them, a dynamic form of vocal learning. The model provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying SVA in adult animals and how they might differ from infant vocal learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Reproduction is a fundamental process that shapes the demography of every living organism yet is often difficult to assess with high precision in animals that produce large numbers of offspring. Here, we present a novel microfluidic research platform for studying Caenorhabditis elegans egg-laying. The platform provides higher throughput than traditional solid-media assays while providing a very high degree of temporal resolution. Additionally, the environmental control enabled by microfluidic animal husbandry allows for experimental perturbations difficult to achieve with solid-media assays. We demonstrate the platforms utility by characterizing C. elegans egg-laying behavior at two commonly used temperatures, 15 and 20{degrees}C. As expected, we observed a delayed onset of egg-laying at 15{degrees}C degrees, consistent with published temperature effects on development rate. Additionally, as seen in solid media studies, egg laying output was higher under the canonical 20{degrees}C conditions. While we validated the Egg-Counter with a study of temperature effects in wild-type animals, the platform is highly adaptable to any nematode egg-laying research where throughput or environmental control needs to be maximized without sacrificing temporal resolution.</p>
