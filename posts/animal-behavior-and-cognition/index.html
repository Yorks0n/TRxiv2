While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes. C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime). C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available. C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators. C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

A.; Cecchetti, G.; Ericson, P.; Cano, E.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.22.546175\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear. In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages. Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.\nBehavioral and Neural Resilience to Isolation in a Eusocial Insect\nAuthors: Goolsby, B. C.; Smith, E. J.; Muratore, I. B.; Coto, Z. N.; Muscedere, M. L.; Traniello, J. F. A.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.546928\nSocial experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.\nEndocannabinoid system modulation alters fine motor behavior in mice: insights from 3D motion capture\nAuthors: Ignatowska-Jankowska, B. M.; Gurkan Ozer, A.; Kuck, A.; Niphakis, M. J.; Ogasawara, D.; Cravatt, B. F.; Uusisaari, M. Y.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546437\nThe neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.\nIntent matters: how flow \u0026 forms of information impact collective navigation\nAuthors: Hodgson, T. M.; Johnston, S. T.; Ottobre, M.; Painter, K. J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.545920\nThe phenomenon of collective navigation has received considerable interest in recent years. A common line of thinking, backed by theoretical studies, is that collective navigation can improve navigation efficiency through the many-wrongs principle, whereby individual error is reduced by comparing the headings of neighbours. When navigation takes place in a flowing environment, each individuals trajectory is influenced by drift. Accordingly a potential discrepancy emerges between an individuals intended heading and its actual heading. In this study we develop a theoretical model to explore whether collective navigation benefits are altered according to the form of heading information transmitted between neighbours. Navigation based on each individuals intended heading is found to confer robust advantages across a wide spectrum of flows, via both a marked improvement in migration times and a capacity for a group to overcome flows unnavigable by solitary individuals. Navigation based on individuals actual headings is far less effective, only offering an improvement under highly favourable currents. For many currents, sharing actual heading information leads to journey times that exceed those of individual navigators, negating the suggested benefits proposed by the many-wrongs principle.\nStochastic characterization of navigation strategies in an automated variant of the Barnes maze\nAuthors: Lee, J.-Y.; Jung, D.; Royer, S.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.14.536859\nAnimals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate from a random start vestibule to a goal vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences; and revealed a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.\nMethylphenidate alleviates attentional and sensorimotor dysfunction induced by developmental manganese exposure: Assessment of catecholaminergic receptor involvement\nAuthors: Beaudin, S.; Howard, S. L.; Santiago, N.; Strupp, B. J.; Smith, D. R.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546786\nBACKGROUND: Environmental manganese (Mn) exposure is associated with impair-ments in attention and psychomotor function as well as impulsivity/hyperactivity in children and adolescents. We have shown previously that developmental Mn exposure can cause these same areas of dysfunction in a rat model. Although treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) is well documented to lessen impairments in attention, im-pulse control, and sensorimotor function in children, it is unknown whether this treat-ment is effective in improving these areas of dysfunction induced by developmental Mn exposure. OBJECTIVES: Determine if oral MPH therapy ameliorates the lasting attention and sensorimotor impairments caused by developmental Mn exposure and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity and MPH effectiveness, if observed. Rats were given 50 mg Mn/kg/d orally over PND 1 - 21 and assessed as adults in a series of attention, impulse control and sensorimotor tasks during chronic oral MPH treatment (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/d), followed by continued behavioral testing in the presence of selective catecholaminergic receptor antagonists (SCH 23390, raclopride, and BRL 44408 s.c.) and MPH treatment, using a quasi-Latin-Square design. RESULTS: Developmental Mn exposure caused persistent attention and sensorimotor impairments in adult rats. MPH therapy at 0.5 mg/kg/d completely ameliorated the Mn-induced attentional dysfunction; notably this benefit was not seen following acute ad-ministration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., \u003e8 days) treatment. The Mn-induced sensorimotor dysfunction was also ameliorated by MPH treatment but only at the 3 mg/kg/d MPH dose. Furthermore, selectively antagonizing D1, D2, or 2A recep-tors had no effect on the Mn-induced attentional deficits, or MPH efficacy to ameliorate those deficits. However, antagonism of D2R attenuated the sensorimotor deficits pro-duced by Mn, whereas the efficacy of MPH to ameliorate those sensorimotor deficits was diminished by D1R antagonism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that MPH treatment is effective in treat-ing the lasting attention and sensorimotor deficits caused by developmental Mn expo-sure, and they clarify the mechanisms underlying developmental Mn neurotoxicity and MPH efficacy. Given that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings may have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly.\nVisual-spatial dynamics drive adaptive social learning in immersive environments\nAuthors: Wu, C. M.; Deffner, D.; Kahl, B.; Meder, B.; Ho, M. H.; Kurvers, R. H.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546887\nHumans are uniquely capable social learners. Our capacity to learn from others across short and long timescales is a driving force behind the success of our species. Yet there are seemingly maladaptive patterns of human social learning, characterized by both overreliance and underreliance on social information. Recent advances in animal research have incorporated rich visual and spatial dynamics to study social learning in ecological contexts, showing how simple mechanisms can give rise to intelligent group dynamics. However, similar techniques have yet to be translated into human research, which additionally requires integrating the sophistication of human individual and social learning mechanisms. Thus, it is still largely unknown how humans dynamically adapt social learning strategies to different environments and how group dynamics emerge under realistic conditions. Here, we use a collective foraging experiment in an immersive Minecraft environment to provide unique insights into how visual-spatial interactions give rise to adaptive, specialized, and selective social learning. Our analyses show how groups adapt to the demands of the environment through specialization rather than homogeneity and through the adaptive deployment of selective imitation rather than indiscriminate copying. We test these mechanisms using computational modeling, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that dynamically influence social decision-making in ecological contexts. Specialization of learning strategies and selective attention thus offer insights into the adaptive foundations of human social learning.\nThanks to repetition, dustbathing detection can be automated combining accelerometry and wavelet analysis\nAuthors: Fonseca, R. G.; Flesia, A. G.; Spanevello, F.; de la Fuente, M. V.; Bosch, M. C.; Marin, R. H.; Barberis, L.; Kembro, J. M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.546399\nDustbathing is performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes. It consists of a well-defined orderly sequence of movements. Repetitive changes in body position during dustbathing can be automatically detected through data processing of body mounted accelerometer recordings, specifically the complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform. The approach was tested in 13 adult male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) fitted with a backpack containing a triaxial accelerometer and video-recorded during at least 6h. Rhythmicity (period 25-60s) in the y-axis acceleration vector is reflected as large power values, and is associated almost exclusively to dustbathing events. Thus, by implementing a threshold value we detected events automatically with an accuracy of 80% (range 66-100%). We show potential uses for characterizing temporal dynamics (e.g. daily rhythms) of dustbathing and for the assessment of intra- and inter-individual variability over long-term studies, even within large complex environments (e.g. natural environments or breeding facilities). Summary statementWe propose a method for automatically detecting dustbathing (i.e a behavior performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes) from triaxial accerometer recoding using a wavelet technique.\n",

        <p class="abstract">O_LIHow animals use the diel period (24-hour light-dark cycle) is of fundamental importance to understand their niche. While ecological and evolutionary literature abound with discussion of diel phenotypes (e.g., diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular, cathemeral), they lack clear and explicit quantitative definitions. As such, inference can be confounded when evaluating hypotheses of animal diel niche switching or plasticity across studies because researchers may be operating under different definitions of diel phenotypes.
C_LIO_LIWe propose quantitative definitions of diel phenotypes using four alternative hypotheses sets (Maximizing, Traditional, General, and Selection) aimed at achieving different objectives. Each hypothesis set is composed of mutually exclusive hypotheses defined based on the activity probabilities in the three fundamental periods of light availability (twilight, daytime, and nighttime).
C_LIO_LIWe develop a Bayesian modeling framework that compares diel phenotype hypotheses using Bayes factors and estimates model parameters using a multinomial model with linear inequality constraints. Model comparison, parameter estimation, and visualizing results can be done in the Diel.Niche R package. A simplified R Shiny web application is also available.
C_LIO_LIWe provide extensive simulation results to guide researchers on the power to discriminate among hypotheses for a range of sample sizes (10 to 1280). We also work through several examples of using data to make inferences on diel activity, and include online vignettes on how to use the Diel.Niche package. We demonstrate how our modeling framework complements analyses that are commonly used to investigate diel activity, such as circular kernel density estimators.
C_LIO_LIOur aim is to encourage standardization of the language of diel activity and bridge conceptual frameworks and hypotheses in diel research with data and models. Lastly, we hope more research focuses on the ecological and conservation importance of understanding how animals use diel time.

        <p class="abstract">The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a marked increase in the use of music listening for self-regulation1. During these challenging times, listeners reported they used music  to keep them company2; indicating that they may have turned to music for social solace3. However, whether this is simply a figure of speech or an empirically observable effect on social thought was previously unclear.

In three experiments, six hundred participants were presented with silence or task-irrelevant music in Italian, Spanish, or Swedish while performing a directed mental-imagery task in which they imagined a journey towards a topographical landmark4. To control for a possible effect of vocals on imagined content, the music was presented with or without vocals to the participants, of which half were native speakers and the other half non-speakers of the respective languages.

Music, compared to silence, led to more vivid imagination and changes in imagined content. Specifically, social interaction emerged as a clear thematic cluster in participants descriptions of their imagined content through Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Moreover, Bayesian Mixed effects models revealed that music significantly increased imagined social content compared to silence conditions. This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension. Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants imagined content. In a fourth experiment, a new group of participants was able to use these visualisations to differentiate between content imagined during music listening and that of the silence condition, but only when listening to the associated music. Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Social experience early in life appears to be necessary for the development of species-typical behavior in animals ranging from insects to primates. Isolation during critical periods of maturation has been shown to impact behavior, gene expression, and brain development in vertebrate and invertebrate clades, yet remarkable resilience to social deprivation, senescence, and loss of sensory input have been demonstrated in some ant species. We reared workers of Camponotus floridanus under conditions of social isolation for increasing time periods up to 45 days and evaluated their behavioral performance, quantified brain development and biogenic amine levels, and compared results of isolated workers with control workers that had natural social contact during development. We found that brood care and foraging performance by isolated workers were unaffected by a lack of social contact. Antennal lobe volume loss occurred in ants experiencing longer isolation periods, while the size of the mushroom bodies, which function in higher-order sensory processing, increased over time after eclosion and were not different from mature controls. Titers of the neuromodulators serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine remained stable in isolated workers. Our results indicate that workers of C. floridanus are largely robust to the deprivation of social contact early in life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neuromodulatory endocannabinoid system is a promising target for therapeutic interventions. One of well-known behavioral effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor activation with exogenous ligands such as THC is inhibition of locomotor activity. However, behavioral effects of the endogenous cannabinoids have not been extensively studied. Despite broad medicinal and recreational use of cannabinoids, little is known about their effects on fine movements, critical for therapeutic applications. Such fine motor function is only resolvable with the precision of marker-based motion capture, which so far has not been available in freely moving mice. Therefore, we have adapted a high-speed, high-resolution marker-based 3D motion capture system to track movement (3D trajectories and speed of markers) during voluntary locomotor tasks in mice. Here we show that enhancing endocannabinoid signaling produces bidirectional effects on locomotor behavior that differ from those caused by exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonist, in unrestricted mice. Given our expectation of subtle rather than dramatic changes with the low and potentially therapeutic doses, we employed a sensitive and accurate marker-based 3D motion capture system to resolve the finest differences in full-body kinematic signatures of mice exploring horizontal and vertical environments. We found that selective upregulation of either of the two main endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or anandamide (AEA) with selective inhibitors of their degradation (MJN110 and PF3845, respectively), produced opposite effects: PF3845 suppressed locomotor activity whereas MJN110 enhanced it. Furthermore, while low doses of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 decreased locomotion in a an open field exploration task as expected, it surprisingly did not affect performance in a vertical climbing task. The results show that the effects of cannabinoid signaling on behavior are not predominantly inhibitory as commonly assumed. Furthermore, we found that the invariant microstructure of locomotory behavior remains unchanged under all treatments, pointing towards motivational rather than motor-related mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The phenomenon of collective navigation has received considerable interest in recent years. A common line of thinking, backed by theoretical studies, is that collective navigation can improve navigation efficiency through the  many-wrongs principle, whereby individual error is reduced by comparing the headings of neighbours. When navigation takes place in a flowing environment, each individuals trajectory is influenced by drift. Accordingly a potential discrepancy emerges between an individuals intended heading and its actual heading. In this study we develop a theoretical model to explore whether collective navigation benefits are altered according to the form of heading information transmitted between neighbours. Navigation based on each individuals intended heading is found to confer robust advantages across a wide spectrum of flows, via both a marked improvement in migration times and a capacity for a group to overcome flows unnavigable by solitary individuals. Navigation based on individuals actual headings is far less effective, only offering an improvement under highly favourable currents. For many currents, sharing actual heading information leads to journey times that exceed those of individual navigators, negating the suggested benefits proposed by the  many-wrongs principle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals can use a repertoire of strategies to navigate in an environment, and it remains an intriguing question how these strategies are selected based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate from a random start vestibule to a goal vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences; and revealed a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUND: Environmental manganese (Mn) exposure is associated with impair-ments in attention and psychomotor function as well as impulsivity/hyperactivity in children and adolescents. We have shown previously that developmental Mn exposure can cause these same areas of dysfunction in a rat model. Although treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) is well documented to lessen impairments in attention, im-pulse control, and sensorimotor function in children, it is unknown whether this treat-ment is effective in improving these areas of dysfunction induced by developmental Mn exposure. OBJECTIVES: Determine if oral MPH therapy ameliorates the lasting attention and sensorimotor impairments caused by developmental Mn exposure and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity and MPH effectiveness, if observed. Rats were given 50 mg Mn/kg/d orally over PND 1 - 21 and assessed as adults in a series of attention, impulse control and sensorimotor tasks during chronic oral MPH treatment (0, 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg/d), followed by continued behavioral testing in the presence of selective catecholaminergic receptor antagonists (SCH 23390, raclopride, and BRL 44408 s.c.) and MPH treatment, using a quasi-Latin-Square design. RESULTS: Developmental Mn exposure caused persistent attention and sensorimotor impairments in adult rats. MPH therapy at 0.5 mg/kg/d completely ameliorated the Mn-induced attentional dysfunction; notably this benefit was not seen following acute ad-ministration, but was apparent after prolonged (i.e., &gt;8 days) treatment. The Mn-induced sensorimotor dysfunction was also ameliorated by MPH treatment but only at the 3 mg/kg/d MPH dose. Furthermore, selectively antagonizing D1, D2, or 2A recep-tors had no effect on the Mn-induced attentional deficits, or MPH efficacy to ameliorate those deficits. However, antagonism of D2R attenuated the sensorimotor deficits pro-duced by Mn, whereas the efficacy of MPH to ameliorate those sensorimotor deficits was diminished by D1R antagonism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that MPH treatment is effective in treat-ing the lasting attention and sensorimotor deficits caused by developmental Mn expo-sure, and they clarify the mechanisms underlying developmental Mn neurotoxicity and MPH efficacy. Given that the cause of attention and co-morbid psychomotor deficits in children is often unknown, these findings may have implications for the treatment of environmentally-induced attentional and psychomotor dysfunction in children more broadly.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Humans are uniquely capable social learners. Our capacity to learn from others across short and long timescales is a driving force behind the success of our species. Yet there are seemingly maladaptive patterns of human social learning, characterized by both overreliance and underreliance on social information. Recent advances in animal research have incorporated rich visual and spatial dynamics to study social learning in ecological contexts, showing how simple mechanisms can give rise to intelligent group dynamics. However, similar techniques have yet to be translated into human research, which additionally requires integrating the sophistication of human individual and social learning mechanisms. Thus, it is still largely unknown how humans dynamically adapt social learning strategies to different environments and how group dynamics emerge under realistic conditions. Here, we use a collective foraging experiment in an immersive Minecraft environment to provide unique insights into how visual-spatial interactions give rise to adaptive, specialized, and selective social learning. Our analyses show how groups adapt to the demands of the environment through specialization rather than homogeneity and through the adaptive deployment of selective imitation rather than indiscriminate copying. We test these mechanisms using computational modeling, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that dynamically influence social decision-making in ecological contexts. Specialization of learning strategies and selective attention thus offer insights into the adaptive foundations of human social learning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dustbathing is performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes. It consists of a well-defined orderly sequence of movements. Repetitive changes in body position during dustbathing can be automatically detected through data processing of body mounted accelerometer recordings, specifically the complex Morlet continuous wavelet transform. The approach was tested in 13 adult male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) fitted with a backpack containing a triaxial accelerometer and video-recorded during at least 6h. Rhythmicity (period 25-60s) in the y-axis acceleration vector is reflected as large power values, and is associated almost exclusively to dustbathing events. Thus, by implementing a threshold value we detected events automatically with an accuracy of 80% (range 66-100%). We show potential uses for characterizing temporal dynamics (e.g. daily rhythms) of dustbathing and for the assessment of intra- and inter-individual variability over long-term studies, even within large complex environments (e.g. natural environments or breeding facilities).

Summary statementWe propose a method for automatically detecting dustbathing (i.e a behavior performed by many groups of birds, including Galliformes) from triaxial accerometer recoding using a wavelet technique.</p>
