In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.\nVocalization Patterns in Laying Hens - An Analysis of Stress-Induced Audio Responses\nAuthors: Neethirajan, S.\nScore: 53.9, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.573338\nThis study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.\nSociality shapes the life histories of animals along the fast-slow continuum, but does not affect their senescence\nAuthors: Salguero-Gomez, R.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.575897\nThe role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.\nPregnancy affects flight behavior in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus)\nAuthors: Calistri-Yeh, A.; Young, V. K. H.; Klingerman, M.; Kloepper, L. N.\nScore: 13.9, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574405\nPregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.\nWITHDRAWN: Behavioral sequences across multiple animal species in the wild share common structural features\nAuthors: Minasandra, P.; Grout, E.

G. W.; Lee, J. C.; Killcross, S.; Westbrook, R. F.; Holmes, N. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575867\nHow is new information organized in memory? According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: small prediction error = updating of existing memory, large prediction error = encoding of new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses; and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.\nA neural correlate of learning fails to predict foraging efficiency in Bombus terrestris.\nAuthors: Pasquier, G.; Pull, C. D.; Ott, S. R.; Leadbeater, E.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576659\nThe mushroom bodies (MB) are integrative structures in the insect brain that, in social bees, contribute to both visual and olfactory learning. Changes in the density of presynaptic boutons (or microglomeruli) within the calyx region of the MB have been repeatedly linked to various aspects of foraging, including forms of learning that are thought to be key to support foraging efficiency. Here we set out to directly test the relationship between foraging efficiency and microglomerulus density in a bumblebee model, Bombus terrestris. We found no evidence that microglomerulus density predicted real-world foraging performance, nor any relationship with foraging experience. Instead, our data suggest a potential non-linear relationship between individual age, independent of foraging experience, and microglomerulus density in the lip region of the calyx, which is associated with olfactory processing. Our findings suggest that in real-world scenarios there is no simple direct relationship between microglomerular density, learning ability and foraging efficiency in bumblebees, highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the relationships between learning abilities, neuroanatomy and foraging efficiency.\nBeyond a unitary construct: Dissecting stopping behaviour in two bird species\nAuthors: Troisi, C. A.; Vernouillet, A.; Allaert, R.; Knoch, S.; Martel, A.; Lens, L.; Verbruggen, F.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575695\nThe ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in going and stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.\nDAMM for the detection and tracking of multiple animals within complex social and environmental settings\nAuthors: Kaul, G.; McDevitt, J.; Johnson, J.; Eban-Rothschild, A.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576153\nAccurate detection and tracking of animals across diverse environments are crucial for behavioral studies in various disciplines, including neuroscience. Recently, machine learning and computer vision techniques have become integral to the neuroscientists toolkit, enabling high-throughput behavioral studies. Despite advancements in localizing individual animals in simple environments, the task remains challenging in complex conditions due to intra-class visual variability and environmental diversity. These limitations hinder studies in ethologically- relevant conditions, such as when animals are concealed within nests or in obscured environments. Moreover, current tools are laborious and time-consuming to employ, requiring extensive, setup-specific annotation and model training/validation procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce the Detect Any Mouse Model (DAMM), a pretrained object detector for localizing mice in complex environments, capable of robust performance with zero to minimal additional training on new experimental setups. Our approach involves collecting and annotating a diverse dataset that encompasses single and multi-housed mice in various lighting conditions, experimental setups, and occlusion levels. We utilize the Mask R-CNN architecture for instance segmentation and validate DAMMs performance with no additional training data (zero-shot inference) and with few examples for fine-tuning (few-shot inference). DAMM excels in zero- shot inference, detecting mice, and even rats, in entirely unseen scenarios and further improves with minimal additional training. By integrating DAMM with the SORT algorithm, we demonstrate robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based methods. Finally, to advance and simplify behavioral studies, we made DAMM accessible to the scientific community with a user-friendly Python API, shared model weights, and a Google Colab implementation. SignificancePresent deep learning tools for animal localization require extensive laborious annotation and time-consuming training for the creation of setup-specific models, slowing scientific progress. Additionally, the effectiveness of these tools in naturalistic settings is impeded by visual variability of objects and environmental diversity, hindering animal detection in complex environments. Our study presents the Detect Any Mouse Model (DAMM), a robustly validated object detector designed for localizing mice in complex environments. DAMM excels in generalization, robustly performing with zero to minimal additional training on previously unseen setups and multi-animal scenarios. Its integration with the SORT algorithm permits robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based tools. These developments, along with our dissemination of DAMM, mark a significant step forward in streamlining ethologically-relevant animal behavioral studies.\nThe transgenerational consequences of paternal social isolation and predation exposure in threespined sticklebacks\nAuthors: Hellmann, J.; Rogers, M.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575739\nO_LIAlthough parents routinely encounter stress in the ecological environment that can affect offspring development (transgenerational plasticity: TGP), nearly all organisms interact with conspecifics that can either independently induce parental stress or can alter how parents respond to ecological stressors. C_LIO_LIDuring social buffering, the presence of conspecifics can reduce the response to or increase the speed of recovery from a stressor. This may have cascading effects on offspring if the presence of conspecifics can mitigate parental responses to ecological stress in ways that blunt transmission of stress-induced transgenerational effects. C_LIO_LIHere, we simultaneously manipulated both paternal social isolation and experience with predation risk prior to fertilization in threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). If social buffering mitigates TGP induced by paternal exposure to predation risk, then we expected fewer phenotypic effects in offspring when fathers are exposed to predation risk with a conspecific with present compared to fathers exposed to predation risk while isolated. C_LIO_LIOffspring of predator-exposed fathers showed reduced anxiety-like behavior. Fathers who were socially isolated had offspring that were captured faster by a live predator, suggesting that social isolation may be a stressor that has maladaptive consequences for offspring. Further, we also found evidence that the presence of a conspecific buffered fathers against the effects of predation risk: offspring of predator-exposed fathers tended to be captured faster by the predator, especially when fathers were isolated compared to when they had neighbors. C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that socially-induced stress is an important, yet underappreciated, mediator of TGP and can elicit transgenerational effects even in species that do not form permanent social groups. Future studies should therefore consider the broader social environment when predicting both within and trans-generational responses to ecological change. C_LI\n",

        <p class="abstract">Self-grooming directed towards a noxiously-stimulated body part is one indicator that an animal may feel pain. In insects, the lack of evidence for such behaviour has been widely argued to reflect the absence of pain experiences. Here, we tested whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) selectively groom one of their antennae that was touched with a noxiously-heated (65 {square}C) probe. In the first two minutes after being touched with the noxiously-heated probe, bees groomed their touched antenna a) more than their untouched antenna, b) more than bees that were touched on the antenna with an unheated probe, and c) more than control (untouched) bees groomed either of their antennae. Our results clearly show that bumblebees can direct grooming towards a site of noxious stimulation. Our findings thus refute arguments that claim that insects do not feel pain because of their lack of displaying this behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">This study presents a novel approach to understanding chicken vocalizations using advanced machine learning techniques. Employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the research aimed to classify and analyze the vocalization patterns of laying hens under various conditions. The dataset comprised vocal recordings from chickens exposed to two distinct stressors - umbrella and dog barking - as well as control groups, across different age stages. The primary objective was to assess how external stressors, age, and the timing of stressor application influence the vocal behavior of chickens. The classification results from the CNN model revealed distinct vocal patterns between control and treated groups, indicating that different types of stressors elicit unique vocal responses in chickens. Notably, the model was successful in distinguishing between pre-stress and post-stress vocalizations, suggesting a significant impact of stressor application on chicken vocal behavior. Additionally, the study found that the age of the chickens played a crucial role in their vocal response to stressors. Younger chickens exhibited different vocalization patterns compared to older ones, with these variations becoming more pronounced over time. The analysis utilized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as the feature set, which effectively captured the spectral characteristics of the bird songs, providing a robust basis for classification. The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of chicken behavior, particularly in relation to environmental stressors and developmental changes. This knowledge holds significant potential for enhancing welfare monitoring practices in poultry farming, offering a non-invasive and technologically advanced method to assess the well-being of chickens in various rearing conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of sociality on the demography of animal species has become an intense focus of research in recent decades. However, efforts to understand the sociality-demography nexus have focused on single species or isolated taxonomic groups. Consequently, we lack generality regarding how sociality shapes demographic traits along the Animal Kingdom. Here, I propose a continuum of sociality, from solitary to tightly social, and test whether it predicts key demographic properties of 152 species, from jellyfish to humans. After correction for body mass and phylogenetic relationships, I show that the sociality continuum predicts key life history traits: more social species live longer, postpone maturity, have greater generation time, and greater probability of achieving reproduction than solitary, gregarious, communal, or colonial species. The sociality continuum is positively correlated with the fast-slow continuum. However, contrary to predictions, sociality does not result in more buffered populations: more social species have a lower ability to benefit from disturbances, although display greater resistance than more solitary species. Finally, I also show that sociality does not shape reproductive or actuarial senescence rates. This cross-taxonomic examination of sociality across the demography of 13 taxonomic classes highlights keyways in which individual interactions shape most aspects of animal demography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pregnancy involves increased body mass and decreased locomotor performance in many species and can be especially impactful on volant animals. To test the hypothesis that bats modify flight behavior to adjust for pregnancy-related increases in mass, we recorded thermal video from a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as they emerged from a roost, during periods associated with pregnancy and post-pregnancy. From video tracking, we calculated the vertical drop distance before upward motion (UM), time from emergence until UM, average speeds before and after UM, and average wingbeat rate per second (WBR). Bats recorded during the pregnancy period had a significantly larger drop distance, longer time until UM, faster flight speed before UM, and higher WBR compared to bats recorded during the non-pregnancy period. Our results suggest that pregnancy has a significant effect on flight in female bats, with a particularly strong impact on achieving UM after emergence. However, the higher WBR recorded from bats flying during the pregnancy period implies that bats acclimate to such changes in body mass by altering their flight behaviors to sustain UM while pregnant.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How is new information organized in memory? According to latent state theories, this is determined by the level of surprise, or prediction error, generated by the new information: small prediction error = updating of existing memory, large prediction error = encoding of new memory. We tested this idea using a protocol in which rats were first conditioned to fear a stimulus paired with shock. The stimulus was then gradually extinguished by progressively reducing the shock intensity until the stimulus was presented alone. Consistent with latent state theories, this gradual extinction protocol (small prediction errors) was better than standard extinction (large prediction errors) in producing long-term suppression of fear responses; and the benefit of gradual extinction was due to updating of the conditioning memory with information about extinction. Thus, prediction error determines how new information is organized in memory, and latent state theories adequately describe the ways in which this occurs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mushroom bodies (MB) are integrative structures in the insect brain that, in social bees, contribute to both visual and olfactory learning. Changes in the density of presynaptic boutons (or microglomeruli) within the calyx region of the MB have been repeatedly linked to various aspects of foraging, including forms of learning that are thought to be key to support foraging efficiency. Here we set out to directly test the relationship between foraging efficiency and microglomerulus density in a bumblebee model, Bombus terrestris. We found no evidence that microglomerulus density predicted real-world foraging performance, nor any relationship with foraging experience. Instead, our data suggest a potential non-linear relationship between individual age, independent of foraging experience, and microglomerulus density in the lip region of the calyx, which is associated with olfactory processing. Our findings suggest that in real-world scenarios there is no simple direct relationship between microglomerular density, learning ability and foraging efficiency in bumblebees, highlighting the gap in knowledge regarding the relationships between learning abilities, neuroanatomy and foraging efficiency.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to stop behaviour is essential for adapting to changes in the environment, a principle that holds true across various species. While traditionally considered a unitary psychological construct, recent studies indicate that this ability is multifaceted. Our research evaluates this multifaceted nature using three tasks that measure stopping in different contexts in two related gull species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and lesser black-backed gulls (L. fuscus). These species were selected for their distinct migration and foraging strategies, offering a unique lens through which to examine behavioural adaptations. Across tasks and species, we conceptualised stopping as a race between a go and a stop runner, and predicted correlations based on the type of stop stimulus, the relative timing of the go and the stop stimuli, and the type of action that needed to be stopped. We found correlations between measures of  going across tasks, but there was less consistency in measures of  stopping. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in  going and  stopping behaviours that were specific to each species, which may be linked to their migration and foraging strategies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted nature of stopping in evolutionary and behavioural studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Accurate detection and tracking of animals across diverse environments are crucial for behavioral studies in various disciplines, including neuroscience. Recently, machine learning and computer vision techniques have become integral to the neuroscientists toolkit, enabling high-throughput behavioral studies. Despite advancements in localizing individual animals in simple environments, the task remains challenging in complex conditions due to intra-class visual variability and environmental diversity. These limitations hinder studies in ethologically- relevant conditions, such as when animals are concealed within nests or in obscured environments. Moreover, current tools are laborious and time-consuming to employ, requiring extensive, setup-specific annotation and model training/validation procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce the Detect Any Mouse Model (DAMM), a pretrained object detector for localizing mice in complex environments, capable of robust performance with zero to minimal additional training on new experimental setups. Our approach involves collecting and annotating a diverse dataset that encompasses single and multi-housed mice in various lighting conditions, experimental setups, and occlusion levels. We utilize the Mask R-CNN architecture for instance segmentation and validate DAMMs performance with no additional training data (zero-shot inference) and with few examples for fine-tuning (few-shot inference). DAMM excels in zero- shot inference, detecting mice, and even rats, in entirely unseen scenarios and further improves with minimal additional training. By integrating DAMM with the SORT algorithm, we demonstrate robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based methods. Finally, to advance and simplify behavioral studies, we made DAMM accessible to the scientific community with a user-friendly Python API, shared model weights, and a Google Colab implementation.

SignificancePresent deep learning tools for animal localization require extensive laborious annotation and time-consuming training for the creation of setup-specific models, slowing scientific progress. Additionally, the effectiveness of these tools in naturalistic settings is impeded by visual variability of objects and environmental diversity, hindering animal detection in complex environments. Our study presents the Detect Any Mouse Model (DAMM), a robustly validated object detector designed for localizing mice in complex environments. DAMM excels in generalization, robustly performing with zero to minimal additional training on previously unseen setups and multi-animal scenarios. Its integration with the SORT algorithm permits robust tracking, competitively performing with keypoint-estimation-based tools. These developments, along with our dissemination of DAMM, mark a significant step forward in streamlining ethologically-relevant animal behavioral studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">O_LIAlthough parents routinely encounter stress in the ecological environment that can affect offspring development (transgenerational plasticity: TGP), nearly all organisms interact with conspecifics that can either independently induce parental stress or can alter how parents respond to ecological stressors.
C_LIO_LIDuring social buffering, the presence of conspecifics can reduce the response to or increase the speed of recovery from a stressor. This may have cascading effects on offspring if the presence of conspecifics can mitigate parental responses to ecological stress in ways that blunt transmission of stress-induced transgenerational effects.
C_LIO_LIHere, we simultaneously manipulated both paternal social isolation and experience with predation risk prior to fertilization in threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). If social buffering mitigates TGP induced by paternal exposure to predation risk, then we expected fewer phenotypic effects in offspring when fathers are exposed to predation risk with a conspecific with present compared to fathers exposed to predation risk while isolated.
C_LIO_LIOffspring of predator-exposed fathers showed reduced anxiety-like behavior. Fathers who were socially isolated had offspring that were captured faster by a live predator, suggesting that social isolation may be a stressor that has maladaptive consequences for offspring. Further, we also found evidence that the presence of a conspecific buffered fathers against the effects of predation risk: offspring of predator-exposed fathers tended to be captured faster by the predator, especially when fathers were isolated compared to when they had neighbors.
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest that socially-induced stress is an important, yet underappreciated, mediator of TGP and can elicit transgenerational effects even in species that do not form permanent social groups. Future studies should therefore consider the broader social environment when predicting both within and trans-generational responses to ecological change.
