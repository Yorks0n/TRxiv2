A.; Copping, J.; Harryman, L.; Cochrane, S.; Horwood, J.\nScore: 29.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.23296672\nIntroductionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective medication to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. PrEP is available free of charge in the United Kingdom from sexual health clinics. Expanding PrEP delivery to community pharmacies holds promise and aligns with UK government goals to eliminate new cases of HIV by 2030. The aim of this scoping review was to describe the existing evidence about the barriers to and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and pharmacy clients, as aligned with the Capacity Opportunity, Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) Model. MethodsFive bibliographic and five review databases were searched from inception to August 2023. Literature of any study design was included if it discussed barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery. Trial registrations, protocols and news articles were excluded. ResultsA total of 649 records were identified, 73 full texts were reviewed, and 56 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included literature was original research (55%), from the United States of America (77%) conducted during or after the year 2020 (63%). Barriers to PrEP delivery for pharmacists included lack of knowledge, training and skills (capability), not having the necessary facilities (opportunity), concern about the costs of PrEP and believing that PrEP use could lead to risk behaviours and STIs (motivation). Facilitators included staff training (capability), time, the right facilities (opportunity), believing PrEP could be a source of profit and could reduce new HIV infections (motivation). For clients, barriers included lack of PrEP awareness (capability), pharmacy facilities (opportunity) and not considering pharmacists as healthcare providers (motivation). Facilitators included awareness of PrEP and pharmacists training to deliver it (capability), the accessibility of pharmacies (opportunity) and having an interest in PrEP (motivation). ConclusionTo effectively enhance PrEP delivery in UK community pharmacies, the identified barriers and facilitators should be explored for relevance in the UK and subsequently addressed and leveraged at the pharmacy team, client and care pathway level. By comprehensively considering all aspects of the COM-B framework, community pharmacies could become crucial providers in expanding PrEP accessibility, contributing significantly to HIV prevention efforts.\nEffects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination on HIV viremia and reservoir size\nAuthors: Duncan, M. C.; Omondi, F. H.; Kinloch, N. N.; Lapointe, H. R.; Speckmaier, S.; Moran Garcia, N.; Lawson, T.; DeMarco, M. L.; Simons, J.; Holmes, D. T.; Lowe, C. F.; Bacani, N.; Sereda, P.; Barrios, R.; Harris, M.; Romney, M. G.; Montaner, J. S. G.; Brumme, C. J.; Brockman, M. A.; Brumme, Z. L.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296718\nObjectiveThe immunogenic nature of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines led to some initial concern that these could stimulate the HIV reservoir. We analyzed changes in plasma HIV loads (pVL) and reservoir size following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 62 people with HIV (PWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and analyzed province-wide trends in pVL before and after the mass vaccination campaign. DesignLongitudinal observational cohort and province-wide analysis. Methods62 participants were sampled pre-vaccination, and one month after their first and second COVID-19 immunizations. Vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies in serum were measured using the Roche Elecsys Anti-S assay. HIV reservoirs were quantified using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay; pVL were measured using the cobas 6800 (LLOQ:20 copies/mL). The province-wide analysis included all 290,401 pVL performed in British Columbia, Canada between 2012-2022. ResultsPre-vaccination, the median intact reservoir size was 77 (IQR:20-204) HIV copies/million CD4+ T-cells, compared to 74 (IQR:27-212) and 65 (IQR:22-174) post-first and -second dose, respectively (all comparisons p\u003e0.07). Pre-vaccination, 82% of participants had pVL\u003c20 copies/mL (max:110 copies/mL), compared to 79% post-first dose (max:183 copies/mL) and 85% post-second dose (max:79 copies/mL) (p\u003e0.4). The magnitude of the vaccine-elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibody response did not correlate with changes in reservoir size nor detectable pVL frequency (p\u003e0.6). We found no evidence linking the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign to population-level increases in detectable pVL frequency among all PWH in the province, nor among those who maintained pVL suppression on ART. ConclusionWe found no evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines induced changes in HIV reservoir size nor plasma viremia.\nPopulation dynamics of HIV drug resistance among pre-treatment and treatment-experienced persons with HIV during treatment scale-up in Uganda: a population-based longitudinal study\nAuthors: Martin, M. A.; Reynolds, S. J.; Ssuuna, C.; Foley, B. T.; Nalugoda, F.; Quinn, T.; Kemp, S. A.; Nakalanzi, M.; Kankaka, E. N.; Kigozi, G.; Ssekubugu, R.; Gupta, R. K.; Abeler-Dorner, L.; Kagaayi, J.; Ratmann, O.; Fraser, C.; Galiwango, R. M.; Bonsall, D.; Grabowski, M. K.; PANGEA-HIV Consortium, ; Rakai Health Sciences Program, Score: 6.0, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.14.23297021\nBackground: Longitudinal data on the population prevalence of HIV drug resistance during scale-up of HIV treatment in Africa are extremely limited. We estimated trends in HIV drug resistance prevalence during ART program expansion from a population-based surveillance cohort in southern Uganda. Methods: We analyzed data from Rakai Community Cohort Study participants aged 15-49 during four survey rounds conducted between 2012 (round 15) and 2019 (round 19). Consenting participants were tested for HIV and completed questionnaires. Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) provided samples for viral load quantification and virus deep-sequencing. Sequence data were used to predict resistance profiles. The prevalence of class-specific resistance and resistance-conferring substitutions were estimated using robust log-Poisson regression. Findings: 93,659 participant visits were contributed between 2012 and 2019, including 17,471 (18.65%) from PLHIV. Using deep-sequencing data from 3,713 pre-treatment participant-visits we estimated that the population prevalence of viremic NNRTI, NRTI, and PI resistance decreased significantly between 2012 and 2017 (PR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 - 0.57; 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.45; 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.39, respectively) with increasing viral suppression. Among viremic pre- treatment PLHIV, the prevalence of NNRTI resistance increased two-fold (PR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.31-2.95) to 9.77% (7.35% - 12.97%) over the same time period. We did not observe an increase in NRTI or PI resistance in this population. The 2017 prevalence of NNRTI and NRTI resistance among viremic treatment-experienced PLHIV was 47.67% (95% CI 40.94% - 55.50%) and 36.55% (95% CI 30.14% - 44.31%), respectively. Single-class resistance predominated among resistant pre-treatment PLHIV (83.05%) whereas most treatment-experienced resistance was multi-class (76.65%). In 2017, 10.13% (95% CI 7.83%-13.63%) and 9.98% (95% CI 6.43%- 15.51%) of viremic pre-treatment and treatment-experienced PLHIV harbored the inT97A mutation. Interpretation: Prevalence of HIV drug resistance among viremic PLHIV significantly increased with scale-up of ART programs. The prevalence of inT97A is potentially concerning considering the recent roll-out of dolutegravir-based regimens. Funding: National Institutes of Health, the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. President's Emergence Plan for AIDS Relief through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nVirologic outcomes on dolutegravir-, atazanavir-, or efavirenz-based ART in urban Zimbabwe: A longitudinal study\nAuthors: Shamu, T.; Egger, M.; Mudzviti, T.; Chimbetete, C.; Manasa, J.; Anderegg, N.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296721\nThere are few data from sub-Saharan Africa on the virologic outcomes associated with second-line ART based on protease inhibitors or dolutegravir (DTG). We compared viral load (VL) suppression among people living with HIV (PLWH) on atazanavir (ATV/r)- or dolutegravir (DTG)-based second-line ART with PLWH on efavirenz (EFV)-based first-line ART. We analyzed data from the electronic medical records system of Newlands Clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. We included patients aged \u003e=12 years when commencing first-line EFV-based ART or switching to second-line DTG- or ATV/r-based ART with \u003e=24 weeks follow-up after start or switch. We computed suppression rates (HIV VL \u003c50 copies/mL) at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 and estimated the probability of VL suppression by treatment regimen, time since start/switch of ART, sex, age, and CD4 cell count (at start/switch) using logistic regression in a Bayesian framework. We included 7013 VL measurements of 1049 PLWH (61% female) initiating first-line ART and 1114 patients (58% female) switching to second-line ART. Among those switching, 872 (78.3%) were switched to ATV/r and 242 (21.7%) to DTG. VL suppression was lower in second-line ART patients than first-line ART patients, except at week 12, when those on DTG showed higher suppression than those on EFV (aOR 2.10, 95%-credible interval [CrI] 1.48-3.00) and ATV/r-based regimens (aOR 1.87, 95%-CrI 1.32-2.71). In weeks \u003e=48, first-line patients had around 3 times the odds of VL suppression compared to second-line patients. There was no evidence of a difference between DTG and ATV/r for follow-up times \u003e24 weeks in PLWH on second-line. Second-line ART patients had lower VL suppression rates than those receiving first-line ART, and there was no difference in suppression between DTG- and ATV/r-based second-line ART \u003e6 months after switching. Virologic monitoring and adherence support remain essential to prevent second-line treatment failure in settings with limited treatment options.\nPharmacogenetics of efavirenz exposure in cervicovaginal fluid during pregnancy and postpartum\nAuthors: Eniayewu, O.; Azuka, U.; Ogah, J.; Adejuyigbe, E.; Bolaji, O.; Olagunju, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.23297046\nObjectives Adequate antiretroviral drug distribution into the female genital tract (FGT) could play an important role in reducing the risk of heterosexual and mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In this study, we investigated the combined influence of pregnancy and genetic polymorphisms on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) of women receiving antiretroviral therapy. Methods A total of 159 women (147 pregnant and 12 postpartum) living with HIV and receiving efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy were recruited across two sites in Nigeria (Federal Medical Centre, and Bishop Murray Medical Centre, Makurdi) between 2017-2020. In stage 1, sparse CVF and dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from each participant during pregnancy to assess possible association between drug concentration and CYP2B6 polymorphisms (516G\u003eT and 983 T\u003eC). In the second stage, participants were stratified into three genotype groups (extensive, intermediate and low metabolisers) and re-enrolled for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. Results In stage 1 (88 CVF, 81 plasma and 73 paired samples), CYP2B6 516G\u003eT was independently associated with both CVF ({beta} = 997 ng/mL (90% CI: 598, 1357), p = 5.7 x 10-5) and plasma ({beta} = 1400 ng/mL (90% CI: 1051, 1748), p = 5.7 x 10-9) efavirenz concentration during pregnancy. In the second stage (12 pregnant, 12 postpartum), median (IQR) efavirenz Cmin in CVF during pregnancy versus postpartum was 243 ng/ml (168-402) vs 447 ng/ml (159-974), Cmax was 1031 ng/ml (595-1771) vs 1618 ng/ml (675-2695), and AUC0-24 was 16465 ng.h/ml (9356-30417) vs 30715 ng.h/ml (10980-43714). Overall, median CVF-to-plasma AUC ratio was 0.34 during pregnancy and 0.46 postpartum. When patients were stratified using CYP2B6 516G\u003eT, efavirenz median clearance increased by 57.9% during pregnancy compared with postpartum control (p = 0.232) in patients with the CYP2B6 516GT genotype. The AUC0-24h , Cmax and Cmin reduced by 33.8% ((p=0.182) , 8.6% (0.175) and 59.5% (0.171) during pregnancy, with values of 20671 ng.h/ml (15993-28712), 1550 ng/ml (1090-2090) and 330 ng/ml (250-440), respectively, compared with 31229 ng.h/ml (27660-41873), 1695 ng/ml (1540-3003) and 814 ng/ml (486-981) during postpartum in this genotype. Median efavirenz Cmin in CVF was 1.93 and 3.55 times higher than the PBIC90 of 126 ng/ml in the pregnant and postpartum cohorts, respectively. Conclusions Efavirenz is well distributed into the CVF, and both pregnancy and polymorphisms in its disposition genes affect CVF exposure.\n",

        <p class="abstract">IntroductionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective medication to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. PrEP is available free of charge in the United Kingdom from sexual health clinics. Expanding PrEP delivery to community pharmacies holds promise and aligns with UK government goals to eliminate new cases of HIV by 2030. The aim of this scoping review was to describe the existing evidence about the barriers to and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and pharmacy clients, as aligned with the Capacity Opportunity, Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) Model.

MethodsFive bibliographic and five review databases were searched from inception to August 2023. Literature of any study design was included if it discussed barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery. Trial registrations, protocols and news articles were excluded.

ResultsA total of 649 records were identified, 73 full texts were reviewed, and 56 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included literature was original research (55%), from the United States of America (77%) conducted during or after the year 2020 (63%). Barriers to PrEP delivery for pharmacists included lack of knowledge, training and skills (capability), not having the necessary facilities (opportunity), concern about the costs of PrEP and believing that PrEP use could lead to risk behaviours and STIs (motivation). Facilitators included staff training (capability), time, the right facilities (opportunity), believing PrEP could be a source of profit and could reduce new HIV infections (motivation). For clients, barriers included lack of PrEP awareness (capability), pharmacy facilities (opportunity) and not considering pharmacists as healthcare providers (motivation). Facilitators included awareness of PrEP and pharmacists training to deliver it (capability), the accessibility of pharmacies (opportunity) and having an interest in PrEP (motivation).

ConclusionTo effectively enhance PrEP delivery in UK community pharmacies, the identified barriers and facilitators should be explored for relevance in the UK and subsequently addressed and leveraged at the pharmacy team, client and care pathway level. By comprehensively considering all aspects of the COM-B framework, community pharmacies could become crucial providers in expanding PrEP accessibility, contributing significantly to HIV prevention efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveThe immunogenic nature of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines led to some initial concern that these could stimulate the HIV reservoir. We analyzed changes in plasma HIV loads (pVL) and reservoir size following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 62 people with HIV (PWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and analyzed province-wide trends in pVL before and after the mass vaccination campaign.

DesignLongitudinal observational cohort and province-wide analysis.

Methods62 participants were sampled pre-vaccination, and one month after their first and second COVID-19 immunizations. Vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies in serum were measured using the Roche Elecsys Anti-S assay. HIV reservoirs were quantified using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay; pVL were measured using the cobas 6800 (LLOQ:20 copies/mL). The province-wide analysis included all 290,401 pVL performed in British Columbia, Canada between 2012-2022.

ResultsPre-vaccination, the median intact reservoir size was 77 (IQR:20-204) HIV copies/million CD4&#43; T-cells, compared to 74 (IQR:27-212) and 65 (IQR:22-174) post-first and -second dose, respectively (all comparisons p&gt;0.07). Pre-vaccination, 82% of participants had pVL&lt;20 copies/mL (max:110 copies/mL), compared to 79% post-first dose (max:183 copies/mL) and 85% post-second dose (max:79 copies/mL) (p&gt;0.4). The magnitude of the vaccine-elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibody response did not correlate with changes in reservoir size nor detectable pVL frequency (p&gt;0.6). We found no evidence linking the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign to population-level increases in detectable pVL frequency among all PWH in the province, nor among those who maintained pVL suppression on ART.

ConclusionWe found no evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines induced changes in HIV reservoir size nor plasma viremia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Longitudinal data on the population prevalence of HIV drug resistance during scale-up of HIV treatment in Africa are extremely limited. We estimated trends in HIV drug resistance prevalence during ART program expansion from a population-based surveillance cohort in southern Uganda. Methods: We analyzed data from Rakai Community Cohort Study participants aged 15-49 during four survey rounds conducted between 2012 (round 15) and 2019 (round 19). Consenting participants were tested for HIV and completed questionnaires. Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) provided samples for viral load quantification and virus deep-sequencing. Sequence data were used to predict resistance profiles. The prevalence of class-specific resistance and resistance-conferring substitutions were estimated using robust log-Poisson regression. Findings: 93,659 participant visits were contributed between 2012 and 2019, including 17,471 (18.65%) from PLHIV. Using deep-sequencing data from 3,713 pre-treatment participant-visits we estimated that the population prevalence of viremic NNRTI, NRTI, and PI resistance decreased significantly between 2012 and 2017 (PR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 - 0.57; 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.45; 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.39, respectively) with increasing viral suppression. Among viremic pre- treatment PLHIV, the prevalence of NNRTI resistance increased two-fold (PR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.31-2.95) to 9.77% (7.35% - 12.97%) over the same time period. We did not observe an increase in NRTI or PI resistance in this population. The 2017 prevalence of NNRTI and NRTI resistance among viremic treatment-experienced PLHIV was 47.67% (95% CI 40.94% - 55.50%) and 36.55% (95% CI 30.14% - 44.31%), respectively. Single-class resistance predominated among resistant pre-treatment PLHIV (83.05%) whereas most treatment-experienced resistance was multi-class (76.65%). In 2017, 10.13% (95% CI 7.83%-13.63%) and 9.98% (95% CI 6.43%- 15.51%) of viremic pre-treatment and treatment-experienced PLHIV harbored the inT97A mutation. Interpretation: Prevalence of HIV drug resistance among viremic PLHIV significantly increased with scale-up of ART programs. The prevalence of inT97A is potentially concerning considering the recent roll-out of dolutegravir-based regimens.

        <p class="abstract">There are few data from sub-Saharan Africa on the virologic outcomes associated with second-line ART based on protease inhibitors or dolutegravir (DTG). We compared viral load (VL) suppression among people living with HIV (PLWH) on atazanavir (ATV/r)- or dolutegravir (DTG)-based second-line ART with PLWH on efavirenz (EFV)-based first-line ART. We analyzed data from the electronic medical records system of Newlands Clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. We included patients aged &gt;=12 years when commencing first-line EFV-based ART or switching to second-line DTG- or ATV/r-based ART with &gt;=24 weeks follow-up after start or switch. We computed suppression rates (HIV VL &lt;50 copies/mL) at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 and estimated the probability of VL suppression by treatment regimen, time since start/switch of ART, sex, age, and CD4 cell count (at start/switch) using logistic regression in a Bayesian framework. We included 7013 VL measurements of 1049 PLWH (61% female) initiating first-line ART and 1114 patients (58% female) switching to second-line ART. Among those switching, 872 (78.3%) were switched to ATV/r and 242 (21.7%) to DTG. VL suppression was lower in second-line ART patients than first-line ART patients, except at week 12, when those on DTG showed higher suppression than those on EFV (aOR 2.10, 95%-credible interval [CrI] 1.48-3.00) and ATV/r-based regimens (aOR 1.87, 95%-CrI 1.32-2.71). In weeks &gt;=48, first-line patients had around 3 times the odds of VL suppression compared to second-line patients. There was no evidence of a difference between DTG and ATV/r for follow-up times &gt;24 weeks in PLWH on second-line. Second-line ART patients had lower VL suppression rates than those receiving first-line ART, and there was no difference in suppression between DTG- and ATV/r-based second-line ART &gt;6 months after switching. Virologic monitoring and adherence support remain essential to prevent second-line treatment failure in settings with limited treatment options.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objectives Adequate antiretroviral drug distribution into the female genital tract (FGT) could play an important role in reducing the risk of heterosexual and mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In this study, we investigated the combined influence of pregnancy and genetic polymorphisms on efavirenz pharmacokinetics in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) of women receiving antiretroviral therapy. Methods A total of 159 women (147 pregnant and 12 postpartum) living with HIV and receiving efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy were recruited across two sites in Nigeria (Federal Medical Centre, and Bishop Murray Medical Centre, Makurdi) between 2017-2020. In stage 1, sparse CVF and dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from each participant during pregnancy to assess possible association between drug concentration and CYP2B6 polymorphisms (516G&gt;T and 983 T&gt;C). In the second stage, participants were stratified into three genotype groups (extensive, intermediate and low metabolisers) and re-enrolled for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. Results In stage 1 (88 CVF, 81 plasma and 73 paired samples), CYP2B6 516G&gt;T was independently associated with both CVF ({beta} = 997 ng/mL (90% CI: 598, 1357), p = 5.7 x 10-5) and plasma ({beta} = 1400 ng/mL (90% CI: 1051, 1748), p = 5.7 x 10-9) efavirenz concentration during pregnancy. In the second stage (12 pregnant, 12 postpartum), median (IQR) efavirenz Cmin in CVF during pregnancy versus postpartum was 243 ng/ml (168-402) vs 447 ng/ml (159-974), Cmax was 1031 ng/ml (595-1771) vs 1618 ng/ml (675-2695), and AUC0-24 was 16465 ng.h/ml (9356-30417) vs 30715 ng.h/ml (10980-43714). Overall, median CVF-to-plasma AUC ratio was 0.34 during pregnancy and 0.46 postpartum. When patients were stratified using CYP2B6 516G&gt;T, efavirenz median clearance increased by 57.9% during pregnancy compared with postpartum control (p = 0.232) in patients with the CYP2B6 516GT genotype. The AUC0-24h , Cmax and Cmin reduced by 33.8% ((p=0.182) , 8.6% (0.175) and 59.5% (0.171) during pregnancy, with values of 20671 ng.h/ml (15993-28712), 1550 ng/ml (1090-2090) and 330 ng/ml (250-440), respectively, compared with 31229 ng.h/ml (27660-41873), 1695 ng/ml (1540-3003) and 814 ng/ml (486-981) during postpartum in this genotype. Median efavirenz Cmin in CVF was 1.93 and 3.55 times higher than the PBIC90 of 126 ng/ml in the pregnant and postpartum cohorts, respectively. Conclusions Efavirenz is well distributed into the CVF, and both pregnancy and polymorphisms in its disposition genes affect CVF exposure.</p>
