V.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.23294716\nAimTo study features of social status, clinical pattern and diagnosis in cases of comorbidity of respiratory tuberculosis and viral pneumonia caused by Herpesvirus Simplex of type 1, Human Cytomegalovirus and SARS-CoV-2 in patients with late-stage HIV infection with immunodeficiency. Materials and methodsThe prospective study included 25 patients with comorbid condition of respiratory tuberculosis with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in excreta, herpesvirus and coronavirus pneumonia, and 21 patients with respiratory tuberculosis as well as cytomegalovirus and coronavirus pneumonia (1a and 2a main groups) and, respectively, 25 and 21 similar patients, but without coronavirus pneumonia (1b and 2b comparison group) in the late stages of HIV infection with immunodeficiency. For the etiological diagnosis of herpesvirus- and cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the PCR test was used for recognition of DNA of Herpesvirus Simplex of type 1 and Human Cytomegalovirus in the diagnostic material of respiratory tract and for the etiological diagnosis of coronavirus pneumonia, the PCR for recognition of RNA was used to reveal SARS-CoV-2. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by the use of the Microsoft Office Excel 2019 software for calculation of group mean, standard error of mean and confidence interval. ResultsThe comorbidity of respiratory tuberculosis, herpes-, cytomegalo- and coronavirus pneumonia in patients with late-stage HIV infection in the phase of progression and in the absence of ART was characterized by severe immunodeficiency and generalization of tuberculosis with multiple extrapulmonary lesions. The results displayed similarity of clinical manifestations and visualization of changes in CT-picture in cases of comorbidity the diseases which hampers their recognition due to simultaneous combination of several pathologies with similar clinical manifestations that requires a complex etiological diagnosis of the specific diseases to prescribe a timely comprehensive treatment and reduce lethality in this severe contingent of patients. ConclusionPatients with respiratory tuberculosis and HIV infection registered in the office of tuberculosis care for HIV-infected individuals in the antituberculosis dispensary represent a group of high risk from COVID-19 infection and CVP disease, and, in cases of combination with severe immunodeficiency, HVP and CMVP, the patients should be regularly subjected to preventive studies for timely detection of COVID-19 for the purpose of their emergency isolation and treatment.\nPlasmatic HIV-1 soluble gp120 is associated with immune dysfunction and inflammation in ART-treated individuals with undetectable viremia\nAuthors: Benlarbi, M.; Richard, J.; Bourassa, C.; Tolbert, W.

The gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein can shed from viral and cellular membranes and can be detected in plasma and tissues, showing immunomodulatory properties even in the absence of detectable viremia. We evaluated whether plasmatic soluble gp120 (sgp120) and a family of gp120-specific anti-cluster A antibodies, which were previously linked to CD4 depletion in vitro, could contribute to chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and sub-clinical cardiovascular disease in participants of the Canadian HIV and Aging cohort (CHACS) with undetectable viremia. MethodsCross-sectional assessment of plasmatic sgp120 and anti-cluster A antibodies was performed in 386 individuals from CHACS. Their association with pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as subclinical coronary artery disease measured by computed tomography coronary angiography was assessed using linear regression models. ResultsIn individuals with high levels of sgp120, anti-cluster A antibodies inversely correlated with CD4 count (p=0.042) and CD4:CD8 ratio (p=0.004). The presence of sgp120 was associated with increased plasma levels of IL-6. In participants with detectable atherosclerotic plaque and detectable sgp120, sgp120 levels, anti-cluster A antibodies and their combination correlated positively with the total volume of atherosclerotic plaques (p=0.01, 0.018 and 0.006, respectively). ConclusionSoluble gp120 may act as a pan toxin causing immune dysfunction and sustained inflammation in a subset of PLWH, contributing to the development of premature comorbidities. Whether drugs targeting sgp120 could mitigate HIV-associated comorbidities in PLWH with suppressed viremia warrants further studies. Key pointsSoluble gp120 is detected in the plasma of people living with HIV-1 with undetectable viremia. The presence of soluble gp120 and anti-cluster A antibodies is associated with immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and sub-clinical cardiovascular disease.\n",
