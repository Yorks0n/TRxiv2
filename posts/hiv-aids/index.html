PrEP is available free of charge in the United Kingdom from sexual health clinics. Expanding PrEP delivery to community pharmacies holds promise and aligns with UK government goals to eliminate new cases of HIV by 2030. The aim of this scoping review was to describe the existing evidence about the barriers to and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and pharmacy clients, as aligned with the Capacity Opportunity, Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) Model. Methods : Five bibliographic and five review databases were searched from inception to August 2023. Literature of any study design was included if it discussed barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery. Trial registrations, protocols and news articles were excluded. Results: A total of 649 records were identified, 73 full texts were reviewed, and 56 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included literature was original research (55%), from the United States of America (77%) conducted during or after the year 2020 (63%). Barriers to PrEP delivery for pharmacists included lack of knowledge, training and skills (capability), not having the necessary facilities (opportunity), concern about the costs of PrEP and believing that PrEP use could lead to risk behaviour's and STIs (motivation). Facilitators included staff training (capability), time, the right facilities (opportunity), believing PrEP could be a source of profit and could reduce new HIV infections (motivation). For clients, barriers included lack of PrEP awareness (capability), pharmacy facilities (opportunity) and not considering pharmacists as healthcare providers (motivation). Facilitators included awareness of PrEP and pharmacist's training to deliver it (capability), the accessibility of pharmacies (opportunity) and having an interest in PrEP (motivation). Conclusion: To effectively enhance PrEP delivery in UK community pharmacies, the identified barriers and facilitators should be explored for relevance in the UK and subsequently addressed and leveraged at the pharmacy team, client and care pathway level. By comprehensively considering all aspects of the COM-B framework, community pharmacies could become crucial providers in expanding PrEP accessibility, contributing significantly to HIV prevention efforts.\nHIV-HBV Co-infections in Central India: Prevalence, Clearance Rates, and Long-term Outcomes from a Decade of Experience at a Tertiary Care Center.\nAuthors: Kunkal, U. R.; Mishra, N.; Tiwari, J.; Saad, T.; Vyas, A. K.; Rai, A.; Rawat, S. K.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296399\nTwo of the most infamous viruses, the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have similar transmission routes. Consequently, some individuals might get co-infected with both viruses resulting in increased deaths and prolonged disease. Even among healthy (Non-immunocompromised) persons, chances of getting persistent HBV infection are 5-10%, however among persons harboring HIV, HBV the persistence rates might escalate up to 15 %. Such increased suffering might occur despite the longevity provided by starting highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which is the current standard treatment. Our pioneering study, in our region aims to assess the prevalence of HIV-HBV co-infection, clearance rates of HBV, demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and long-term outcomes. By shedding light on these aspects, we hope to gain valuable insights into the impact of such co-infections and pave the way for better management and care of individuals facing this dual challenge. We studied 1808 persons enrolled for HIV treatment from amongst 170,019 persons screened. Higher co-infection of HIV-HBV was observed in males as compared to females, with the age group of 31-40 years being most affected. The most common route of infection, was heterosexual contact accounting for 86% of cases, accounting for majority co-infections. Over the years, we noticed a decline in the number of HIV-HBV co-infected cases, with the nadir occurring in 2015. Seroprevalence of co-infections was 2.37%, but despite this observed low sero-prevalence HBV clearance was relatively poor among the co-infected, as only 4 (9.3%) able to clear the infection after initiation of HAART. Our study highlights that chances of HBV clearance among the co-infected are worse than that observed among otherwise heathy populations thus also highlighting the urgent need for universal HBV vaccination in all HIV-affected persons, underscoring the importance of providing special attention to them.\nEffects of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination on HIV viremia and reservoir size\nAuthors: Duncan, M. C.; Omondi, F. H.; Kinloch, N. N.; Lapointe, H. R.; Speckmaier, S.; Moran Garcia, N.; Lawson, T.; DeMarco, M. L.; Simons, J.; Holmes, D. T.; Lowe, C. F.; Bacani, N.; Sereda, P.; Barrios, R.; Harris, M.; Romney, M. G.; Montaner, J. S. G.; Brumme, C. J.; Brockman, M. A.; Brumme, Z. L.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296718\nObjective: The immunogenic nature of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines led to some initial concern that these could stimulate the HIV reservoir. We analyzed changes in plasma HIV loads (pVL) and reservoir size following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 62 people with HIV (PWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and analyzed province-wide trends in pVL before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Design: Longitudinal observational cohort and province-wide analysis. Methods: 62 participants were sampled pre-vaccination, and one month after their first and second COVID-19 immunizations. Vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies in serum were measured using the Roche Elecsys Anti-S assay. HIV reservoirs were quantified using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay; pVL were measured using the cobas 6800 (LLOQ:20 copies/mL). The province-wide analysis included all 290,401 pVL performed in British Columbia, Canada between 2012-2022. Results: Pre-vaccination, the median intact reservoir size was 77 (IQR:20-204) HIV copies/million CD4+ T-cells, compared to 74 (IQR:27-212) and 65 (IQR:22-174) post-first and -second dose, respectively (all comparisons p\u003e0.07). Pre-vaccination, 82% of participants had pVL\u003c20 copies/mL (max:110 copies/mL), compared to 79% post-first dose (max:183 copies/mL) and 85% post-second dose (max:79 copies/mL) (p\u003e0.4). The magnitude of the vaccine-elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibody response did not correlate with changes in reservoir size nor detectable pVL frequency (p\u003e0.6). We found no evidence linking the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign to population-level increases in detectable pVL frequency among all PWH in the province, nor among those who maintained pVL suppression on ART. Conclusion: We found no evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines induced changes in HIV reservoir size nor plasma viremia.\nStudy protocol for a multi-centre stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial to explore the usability and outcomes among young people living with HIV in Kiambu and Kirinyaga counties of Kenya, using an online health portal\nAuthors: Nturibi, E.; Mecha, J.; Kubo, E.; Orwa, A.; Kaara, F.; Musau, F.; Wamuyu, C.; Kilonzi, J.; Gill, R.; Roels, S.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296464\nIntroduction: While HIV incidence declines in most age groups globally, it continues to rise among adolescents and young adults who also experience a higher rate of HIV-related deaths. These tech-savvy individuals might benefit from an online patient portal aimed at increasing awareness, building skills, and promoting patient activation, defined as the willingness and capacity to independently manage their health. However, the impact of such portals on young HIV patients in Kenya remains uncertain. Methods and analysis: HIV patients aged 15-24 with smartphone access will participate in a 12-month stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The main focus will be the portal's effect on patient activation, with secondary outcomes being self-reported adherence, viral suppression, and social involvement. The study also aims to understand the portal's development, implementation, functionality, usability, and cost. From 47 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites with electronic medical recording systems, 16 clusters of 30 participants each will be formed. These clusters, over 12 months, will be randomized into 3 intervention sequences every 3 months. Baseline measurements, covering patient activation, adherence, viral load, and social engagement, will be recorded over two weeks, with subsequent checks at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol has received approval from the AMREF Health Africa Ethics \u0026 Scientific Review Committee (ESRC) and local governments. It is registered under the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as: PACTR202303729957231. Findings will be shared through stakeholder forums, conferences, publications, and media.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Two of the most infamous viruses, the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have similar transmission routes. Consequently, some individuals might get co-infected with both viruses resulting in increased deaths and prolonged disease. Even among healthy (Non-immunocompromised) persons, chances of getting persistent HBV infection are 5-10%, however among persons harboring HIV, HBV the persistence rates might escalate up to 15 %. Such increased suffering might occur despite the longevity provided by starting highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which is the current standard treatment.

Our pioneering study, in our region aims to assess the prevalence of HIV-HBV co-infection, clearance rates of HBV, demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and long-term outcomes. By shedding light on these aspects, we hope to gain valuable insights into the impact of such co-infections and pave the way for better management and care of individuals facing this dual challenge.

We studied 1808 persons enrolled for HIV treatment from amongst 170,019 persons screened. Higher co-infection of HIV-HBV was observed in males as compared to females, with the age group of 31-40 years being most affected. The most common route of infection, was heterosexual contact accounting for 86% of cases, accounting for majority co-infections. Over the years, we noticed a decline in the number of HIV-HBV co-infected cases, with the nadir occurring in 2015. Seroprevalence of co-infections was 2.37%, but despite this observed low sero-prevalence HBV clearance was relatively poor among the co-infected, as only 4 (9.3%) able to clear the infection after initiation of HAART. Our study highlights that chances of HBV clearance among the co-infected are worse than that observed among otherwise heathy populations thus also highlighting the urgent need for universal HBV vaccination in all HIV-affected persons, underscoring the importance of providing special attention to them.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Objective: The immunogenic nature of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines led to some initial concern that these could stimulate the HIV reservoir. We analyzed changes in plasma HIV loads (pVL) and reservoir size following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 62 people with HIV (PWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and analyzed province-wide trends in pVL before and after the mass vaccination campaign. Design: Longitudinal observational cohort and province-wide analysis. Methods: 62 participants were sampled pre-vaccination, and one month after their first and second COVID-19 immunizations. Vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies in serum were measured using the Roche Elecsys Anti-S assay. HIV reservoirs were quantified using the Intact Proviral DNA Assay; pVL were measured using the cobas 6800 (LLOQ:20 copies/mL). The province-wide analysis included all 290,401 pVL performed in British Columbia, Canada between 2012-2022. Results: Pre-vaccination, the median intact reservoir size was 77 (IQR:20-204) HIV copies/million CD4&#43; T-cells, compared to 74 (IQR:27-212) and 65 (IQR:22-174) post-first and -second dose, respectively (all comparisons p&gt;0.07). Pre-vaccination, 82% of participants had pVL&lt;20 copies/mL (max:110 copies/mL), compared to 79% post-first dose (max:183 copies/mL) and 85% post-second dose (max:79 copies/mL) (p&gt;0.4). The magnitude of the vaccine-elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibody response did not correlate with changes in reservoir size nor detectable pVL frequency (p&gt;0.6). We found no evidence linking the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign to population-level increases in detectable pVL frequency among all PWH in the province, nor among those who maintained pVL suppression on ART. Conclusion: We found no evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines induced changes in HIV reservoir size nor plasma viremia.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: While HIV incidence declines in most age groups globally, it continues to rise among adolescents and young adults who also experience a higher rate of HIV-related deaths. These tech-savvy individuals might benefit from an online patient portal aimed at increasing awareness, building skills, and promoting patient activation, defined as the willingness and capacity to independently manage their health. However, the impact of such portals on young HIV patients in Kenya remains uncertain. Methods and analysis: HIV patients aged 15-24 with smartphone access will participate in a 12-month stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The main focus will be the portal&#39;s effect on patient activation, with secondary outcomes being self-reported adherence, viral suppression, and social involvement. The study also aims to understand the portal&#39;s development, implementation, functionality, usability, and cost. From 47 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites with electronic medical recording systems, 16 clusters of 30 participants each will be formed. These clusters, over 12 months, will be randomized into 3 intervention sequences every 3 months. Baseline measurements, covering patient activation, adherence, viral load, and social engagement, will be recorded over two weeks, with subsequent checks at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol has received approval from the AMREF Health Africa Ethics &amp; Scientific Review Committee (ESRC) and local governments. It is registered under the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as: PACTR202303729957231. Findings will be shared through stakeholder forums, conferences, publications, and media.</p>
