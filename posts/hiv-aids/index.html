Innovative strategies to increase PrEP uptake are needed. This study examined the use of crowdsourcing to increase PrEP uptake by describing and analysing the experiences of Australia, the Philippines, and China. MethodsThree crowdsourcing open calls were conducted between 2021-2022 in Australia, the Philippines and China. Crowdsourcing has a group of individuals solve all or part of a problem, then share back solutions with the public. All open calls entailed: 1) problem identification; 2) committee formation with local groups; 3) community engagement for idea submission; 4) evaluation of submissions; 5) awarding incentives to finalists; and 6) solution dissemination via web and social media. We examined the number of total and high-quality submissions. We also identified themes across countries. ResultsThe Australia, Philippines, and China teams received 9, 22 and 19 eligible submissions, respectively. A total of three, 10, and eight submissions had a mean score of 6/10 or greater. Three common solutions emerged across all the finalist ideas: enhancing service delivery; optimizing promotional campaigns; person-centered promotional materials. The winning ideas from the Australian, Filipino and Chinese teams were an anonymous online PrEP service, a printed ready-to-wear garment to create awareness about PrEP, and a poster on PrEP effectiveness, respectively. ConclusionsCrowdsourcing can be a promising and versatile tool for developing PrEP strategies in Asia. Further evaluations via clinical trials can bridge the gap between idea generation and implementation, thus, creating the empirical evidence pivotal for the policy adoption of these innovations.\nActivated NK Cells with Pro-inflammatory Features are Associated with Atherogenesis in Perinatally HIV-Acquired Adolescents\nAuthors: Alles, M.; Gunasena, M.; Kettelhut, A.; Ailstock, K.; Musiime, V.; Kityo, C.; Richardson, B.; Mulhern, W.; Tamilselvan, B.; Rubsamen, M.; Kasturiratna, D.; Demberg, T.; Cameron, C. M.; Cameron, M.; Dirajlal-Fargo, S.; Funderburg, N. T.; Liyanage, N. P. M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23297580\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with persistent immune activation and dysfunction in people with HIV despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Modulation of the immune system may be driven by: low-level HIV replication, co-pathogens, gut dysbiosis /translocation, altered lipid profiles, and ART toxicities. In addition, perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) and lifelong ART may alter the development and function of the immune system. Our preliminary data and published literature suggest reprogramming innate immune cells may accelerate aging and increase the risk for future end-organ complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). The exact mechanisms, however, are currently unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells are a highly heterogeneous cell population with divergent functions. They play a critical role in HIV transmission and disease progression in adults. Recent studies suggest the important role of NK cells in CVDs; however, little is known about NK cells and their role in HIV-associated cardiovascular risk in PHIV adolescents. Here, we investigated NK cell subsets and their potential role in atherogenesis in PHIV adolescents compared to HIV-negative adolescents in Uganda. Our data suggest, for the first time, that activated NK subsets in PHIV adolescents may contribute to atherogenesis by promoting plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) uptake by vascular macrophages.\nEndogenous Retroelement Expression in the Gut Microenvironment of People Living with HIV-1\nAuthors: Dopkins, N.; Fei, T.; Michael, S.; Liotta, N.; Guo, K.; Mickens, K. L.; Barrett, B. S.; Bendall, M. L.; Dillon, S. M.; Wilson, C. C.; Santiago, M. L.; Nixon, D. F.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.23298166\nBackgroundEndogenous retroelements (EREs), including human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), comprise almost half of the human genome. HIV-1 infects a target cell already possessing ancient retroviral genetic material, and exogenous HIV-1 infection modulates the expression of cell associated EREs. Following initial HIV-1 infection, there is a rapid destruction of CD4+ cells in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our previous studies of the interferome in the gut suggest potential mechanisms regarding how IFNb may drive HIV-1 gut pathogenesis. As ERE activity is suggested to partake in type 1 immune responses and is incredibly sensitive to viral infections, we sought to elucidate underlying interactions between ERE expression and GALT dynamics in PLWH. MethodsERE expression profiles from bulk RNA sequencing of colon biopsies and PBMC were compared between a cohort of PLWH prior to or within 7 days of initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n=19) and uninfected controls (n=13). Individual EREs were then compared with the profiling of uninfected gut CD4+ T cells activated with type 1 interferons (IFN-Is) (n=3) to elucidate potential mechanisms for their induction in PLWH. Findings59 EREs were differentially expressed in the colon of PLWH when compared to uninfected controls (Walds Test with Benjamin-Hochberg correction: padj \u003c 0.05 and FC [\u0026le;] -1 or [\u0026ge;] 1). Of these 59, 12 EREs were downregulated in PLWH and 47 were upregulated. Colonic expression of the ERE loci LTR19_12p13.31 and L1FLnI_1q23.1s showed significant correlations with CD8+ T Cells and dendritic cell subset frequencies in the GI tract (Spearmans Correlation: p value \u003c 0.05). Furthermore L1FLnI_1q23.1s showed a significant upregulation in the blood of PLWH when compared to uninfected controls (T test: p \u003c0.05) suggesting a common mechanism of differential ERE expression in PBMC and GALT. InterpretationERE activity has been largely understudied in genomic characterizations of human pathologies. We show that the activity of certain EREs in the GI tract of PLWH is deregulated, supporting our hypotheses that their underlying activity could function as (bio)markers and potential mediators of pathogenesis in HIV-1 reservoirs.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundEndogenous retroelements (EREs), including human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), comprise almost half of the human genome. HIV-1 infects a target cell already possessing ancient retroviral genetic material, and exogenous HIV-1 infection modulates the expression of cell associated EREs. Following initial HIV-1 infection, there is a rapid destruction of CD4&#43; cells in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Our previous studies of the interferome in the gut suggest potential mechanisms regarding how IFNb may drive HIV-1 gut pathogenesis. As ERE activity is suggested to partake in type 1 immune responses and is incredibly sensitive to viral infections, we sought to elucidate underlying interactions between ERE expression and GALT dynamics in PLWH.

MethodsERE expression profiles from bulk RNA sequencing of colon biopsies and PBMC were compared between a cohort of PLWH prior to or within 7 days of initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n=19) and uninfected controls (n=13). Individual EREs were then compared with the profiling of uninfected gut CD4&#43; T cells activated with type 1 interferons (IFN-Is) (n=3) to elucidate potential mechanisms for their induction in PLWH.

Findings59 EREs were differentially expressed in the colon of PLWH when compared to uninfected controls (Walds Test with Benjamin-Hochberg correction: padj &lt; 0.05 and FC [&amp;le;] -1 or [&amp;ge;] 1). Of these 59, 12 EREs were downregulated in PLWH and 47 were upregulated. Colonic expression of the ERE loci LTR19_12p13.31 and L1FLnI_1q23.1s showed significant correlations with CD8&#43; T Cells and dendritic cell subset frequencies in the GI tract (Spearmans Correlation: p value &lt; 0.05). Furthermore L1FLnI_1q23.1s showed a significant upregulation in the blood of PLWH when compared to uninfected controls (T test: p &lt;0.05) suggesting a common mechanism of differential ERE expression in PBMC and GALT.

InterpretationERE activity has been largely understudied in genomic characterizations of human pathologies. We show that the activity of certain EREs in the GI tract of PLWH is deregulated, supporting our hypotheses that their underlying activity could function as (bio)markers and potential mediators of pathogenesis in HIV-1 reservoirs.
