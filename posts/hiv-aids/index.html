The identification of local immunological mechanisms involved in the development of anal dysplasia could aid treatment and diagnostics. We performed a study of 111 anal biopsies obtained from 101 MSM with HIV, who participated in an anal screening program. In a test prospective cohort (N=54), in addition to histological examination, we assessed multiple immune subsets by flow cytometry. Selected molecules were further evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a validation retrospective cohort (N=47). Pathological samples were characterized by the presence of Resident Memory T cells with low expression of CD103 and by changes in the Natural Killer cell subsets, affecting residency and activation. Furthermore, potentially immune suppressive subsets, including CD15+ CD16+ mature neutrophils, gradually increased as the anal lesion progressed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the association between the presence of CD15 in the epithelium and SIL diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 71% (AUC 0.762) for the correlation with high-grade SIL. A complex immunological environment with imbalanced proportions of resident effectors and immune suppressive subsets characterizes pathological samples. Neutrophil infiltration, determined by CD15 staining, may represent a valuable pathological marker associated with the grade of dysplasia.

The gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein can shed from viral and cellular membranes and can be detected in plasma and tissues, showing immunomodulatory properties even in the absence of detectable viremia. We evaluated whether plasmatic soluble gp120 (sgp120) and a family of gp120-specific anti-cluster A antibodies, which were previously linked to CD4 depletion in vitro, could contribute to chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and sub-clinical cardiovascular disease in participants of the Canadian HIV and Aging cohort (CHACS) with undetectable viremia. MethodsCross-sectional assessment of plasmatic sgp120 and anti-cluster A antibodies was performed in 386 individuals from CHACS. Their association with pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as subclinical coronary artery disease measured by computed tomography coronary angiography was assessed using linear regression models. ResultsIn individuals with high levels of sgp120, anti-cluster A antibodies inversely correlated with CD4 count (p=0.042) and CD4:CD8 ratio (p=0.004). The presence of sgp120 was associated with increased plasma levels of IL-6. In participants with detectable atherosclerotic plaque and detectable sgp120, sgp120 levels, anti-cluster A antibodies and their combination correlated positively with the total volume of atherosclerotic plaques (p=0.01, 0.018 and 0.006, respectively). ConclusionSoluble gp120 may act as a pan toxin causing immune dysfunction and sustained inflammation in a subset of PLWH, contributing to the development of premature comorbidities. Whether drugs targeting sgp120 could mitigate HIV-associated comorbidities in PLWH with suppressed viremia warrants further studies. Key pointsSoluble gp120 is detected in the plasma of people living with HIV-1 with undetectable viremia.
