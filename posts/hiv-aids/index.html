Abstract: Two of the most infamous viruses, the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have similar transmission routes. Consequently, some individuals might get co-infected with both viruses resulting in increased deaths and prolonged disease. Even among healthy (Non-immunocompromised) persons, chances of getting persistent HBV infection are 5-10%, however among persons harboring HIV, HBV the persistence rates might escalate up to 15 %. Such increased suffering might occur despite the longevity provided by starting highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which is the current standard treatment. Our pioneering study, conducted in central India, aims to assess the prevalence of HIV-HBV co-infection, clearance rates of HBV, demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and long-term outcomes. By shedding light on these aspects, we hope to gain valuable insights into the impact of such co-infections and pave the way for better management and care of individuals facing this dual challenge. We studied 1808 persons enrolled for HIV treatment from amongst 170,019 persons screened. Higher co-infection of HIV-HBV was observed in males as compared to females, with the age group of 31-40 years being most affected. The most common route of infection, was heterosexual contact accounting for 86% of cases, accounting for majority co-infections. Over the years, we noticed a decline in the number of HIV-HBV co-infected cases, with the nadir occurring in 2015. Seroprevalence of co-infections was 2.37%, but despite this observed low sero-prevalence HBV clearance was relatively poor among the co-infected, as only 4 (9.3%) able to clear the infection after initiation of HAART. Our study highlights that chances of HBV clearance among the co-infected are worse than that observed among otherwise heathy populations thus also highlighting the urgent need for universal HBV vaccination in all HIV-affected persons, underscoring the importance of providing special attention to them.\nStudy protocol for a multi-centre stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial to explore the usability and outcomes among young people living with HIV in Kiambu and Kirinyaga counties of Kenya, using an online health portal\nAuthors: Nturibi, E.; Mecha, J.; Kubo, E.; Orwa, A.; Kaara, F.; Musau, F.; Wamuyu, C.; Kilonzi, J.; Gill, R.; Roels, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296464\nIntroduction: While HIV incidence declines in most age groups globally, they rise among adolescents and young adults who also experience a higher rate of HIV-related deaths. These tech-savvy individuals might benefit from an online patient portal aimed at increasing awareness, building skills, and promoting patient activation - the willingness and capacity to independently manage their health. However, the impact of such portals on young HIV patients in Kenya remains uncertain. Methods and analysis: HIV patients aged 15-24 with smartphone access will participate in a 12-month stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The main focus will be the portal's effect on patient activation, with secondary outcomes being self-reported adherence, viral suppression, and social involvement. The study also aims to understand the portal's development, implementation, functionality, usability, and cost. From 47 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites with electronic medical recording systems, 16 clusters of 30 participants each will be formed. These clusters, over 12 months, will be randomized into 3 intervention sequences every 3 months. Baseline measurements, covering patient activation, adherence, viral load, and social engagement, will be recorded over two weeks, with subsequent checks at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data will be analyzed using generalised linear mixed models. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol has received approval from the AMREF Health Africa Ethics \u0026 Scientific Review Committee (ESRC) and local governments. It is registered under the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as: PACTR202303729957231. Findings will be shared through stakeholder forums, conferences, publications, and media.\nHIV-DRIVES: HIV Drug Resistance Identification, Variant Evaluation, \u0026 Surveillance Pipeline\nAuthors: Kanyerezi, S.; Sserwadda, I.; Ssemaganda, A.; Sseruyange, J.; Ayitewala, A.; Oundo, H.; Tenywa, W.; Kagurusi, B.; Tusabe, G.; Were, S.; Ssewanyana, I.; Nabadda, S.; Namaganda, M. M.; Mboowa, G.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.23296350\nThe global prevalence of resistance to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) emphasizes the need to continuous monitoring to better understand the dynamics of drug-resistant mutations to guide treatment optimization and patient management as well as check the spread of resistant viral strains. We have recently, integrated next-generation sequencing (NGS) into routine HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) monitoring, with key challenges in the bioinformatic analysis and interpretation of the complex data generated while ensuring data security and privacy of patient information. To address these challenges, here, we present HIV-DRIVES (HIV Drug Resistance Identification, Variant Evaluation, and Surveillance), an NGS-HIVDR bioinformatics pipeline that has been developed and validated using Illumina short-reads, FASTA, and sanger ab1.seq files.

A.; Berhe, F. T.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.23296311\nBackground- loss of follow-up is a significant public health concern globally. Retention in preventive care among at-risk key and priority population groups is critical for the successful prevention of HIV acquisition. Loss to follow-up of individuals has countless negative impacts on HIV prevention outcomes. There is, however, limited information about the incidence and predictors of loss to follow-up in the study area. Thus, this study aimed to determine the incidence rate and predictors of loss to follow-up among Prep users. Method- A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using 240 PrEP users between May 2020, and May 26, 2022, at Addis Ababa selected health centers. All eligible clients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in study. Results and discussionA total of 240 participants with a median age of 32.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 27.0 to 40.0) had a median time since initiation of PrEP 21.2 months (IQR: 6.5 to 22.1). Almost half 122 (50.8%) were married, single 58 (24.2%), divorced 10 (4.2%), and widowed 50 (20.8%). One third were female sex workers (33.3%), and the rest (66.7%) were sero-discordant couples. Most of the users were from ART clinics (60.8%) and (39.2%) were from PMTCT clinics Being male is associated with 1.77 times in risk of getting lost than female (ARR=1.77, 95% CI =1.12-2.79). those who had no adherence counseling was associated with 1.86 times in the chance of LTFU as compared to those who had have adherence counseling (ARR=1.863, 95% CI =1.184, 2.930, P-value=0.003). 86 (35.8%) experienced loss to follow-up and the overall incidence rate of loss to follow-up was 7.3 (95% CI: 4.3-12.6) per 100 person-years of observation (PYs). PrEP adherence strategies should be developed and designed as a holistic approach, acknowledging the contextual factors of key population groups. Conclusion- About 35.8% clients became LTFU of PrEP with overall incidence of 7.3(4.3-12.6) per 100 pys observation. Research preparedness involving key and priority population groups should be strengthened for HIV prevention intervention evaluations in Ethiopia.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Introduction: While HIV incidence declines in most age groups globally, they rise among adolescents and young adults who also experience a higher rate of HIV-related deaths. These tech-savvy individuals might benefit from an online patient portal aimed at increasing awareness, building skills, and promoting patient activation - the willingness and capacity to independently manage their health. However, the impact of such portals on young HIV patients in Kenya remains uncertain. Methods and analysis: HIV patients aged 15-24 with smartphone access will participate in a 12-month stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. The main focus will be the portal&#39;s effect on patient activation, with secondary outcomes being self-reported adherence, viral suppression, and social involvement. The study also aims to understand the portal&#39;s development, implementation, functionality, usability, and cost. From 47 antiretroviral therapy (ART) sites with electronic medical recording systems, 16 clusters of 30 participants each will be formed. These clusters, over 12 months, will be randomized into 3 intervention sequences every 3 months. Baseline measurements, covering patient activation, adherence, viral load, and social engagement, will be recorded over two weeks, with subsequent checks at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data will be analyzed using generalised linear mixed models. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol has received approval from the AMREF Health Africa Ethics &amp; Scientific Review Committee (ESRC) and local governments. It is registered under the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry as: PACTR202303729957231. Findings will be shared through stakeholder forums, conferences, publications, and media.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The global prevalence of resistance to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) emphasizes the need to continuous monitoring to better understand the dynamics of drug-resistant mutations to guide treatment optimization and patient management as well as check the spread of resistant viral strains. We have recently, integrated next-generation sequencing (NGS) into routine HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) monitoring, with key challenges in the bioinformatic analysis and interpretation of the complex data generated while ensuring data security and privacy of patient information. To address these challenges, here, we present HIV-DRIVES (HIV Drug Resistance Identification, Variant Evaluation, and Surveillance), an NGS-HIVDR bioinformatics pipeline that has been developed and validated using Illumina short-reads, FASTA, and sanger ab1.seq files.

        <p class="abstract">Background-  loss of follow-up is a significant public health concern globally. Retention in preventive care among at-risk key and priority population groups is critical for the successful prevention of HIV acquisition. Loss to follow-up of individuals has countless negative impacts on HIV prevention outcomes. There is, however, limited information about the incidence and predictors of loss to follow-up in the study area. Thus, this study aimed to determine the incidence rate and predictors of loss to follow-up among Prep users.

Method- A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using 240 PrEP users between May 2020, and May 26, 2022, at Addis Ababa selected health centers. All eligible clients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in study.

Results and discussionA total of 240 participants with a median age of 32.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 27.0 to 40.0) had a median time since initiation of PrEP 21.2 months (IQR: 6.5 to 22.1). Almost half 122 (50.8%) were married, single 58 (24.2%), divorced 10 (4.2%), and widowed 50 (20.8%). One third were female sex workers (33.3%), and the rest (66.7%) were sero-discordant couples. Most of the users were from ART clinics (60.8%) and (39.2%) were from PMTCT clinics Being male is associated with 1.77 times in risk of getting lost than female (ARR=1.77, 95% CI =1.12-2.79). those who had no adherence counseling was associated with 1.86 times in the chance of LTFU as compared to those who had have adherence counseling (ARR=1.863, 95% CI =1.184, 2.930, P-value=0.003). 86 (35.8%) experienced loss to follow-up and the overall incidence rate of loss to follow-up was 7.3 (95% CI: 4.3-12.6) per 100 person-years of observation (PYs). PrEP adherence strategies should be developed and designed as a holistic approach, acknowledging the contextual factors of key population groups.

Conclusion- About 35.8% clients became LTFU of PrEP with overall incidence of 7.3(4.3-12.6) per 100 pys observation. Research preparedness involving key and priority population groups should be strengthened for HIV prevention intervention evaluations in Ethiopia.</p>
