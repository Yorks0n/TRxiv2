J.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-25 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.24301757\nBackgroundPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe and effective medication for preventing HIV acquisition. We examined Australian general practitioners (GP) knowledge of PrEP efficacy, characteristics associated with ever prescribing PrEP, and barriers to prescribing. MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional survey of GPs working in Australia between April and October 2022. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with: 1) the belief that PrEP was at least 80% efficacious; and 2) ever prescribed PrEP. We asked participants to rate the extent to which barriers affected their prescribing of PrEP. Results407 participants with a median age of 38 years (interquartile range 33-44). Half of the participants (50%, 205/407) identified how to correctly take PrEP, 63% (258/407) had ever prescribed PrEP, and 45% (184/407) felt confident with prescribing PrEP. Ever prescribing PrEP was associated with younger age (AOR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.94-0.99), extra training in sexual health (AOR 2.57, 95%CI: 1.54-4.29), and being a S100 Prescriber (OR 2.95, 95%CI: 1.47-5.90). The main barriers to prescribing PrEP included: Difficulty identifying clients who require PrEP/relying on clients to ask for PrEP (76%, 310/407), Lack of knowledge about PrEP (70%, 286/407), and Lack of time (69%, 281/407). ConclusionLess than half of our GP respondents were confident in prescribing PrEP, and most had difficulty identifying who would require PrEP. Specific training on PrEP, which focuses on PrEP knowledge, identifying suitable clients, and making it time efficient is recommended, with GPs being remunerated for their time.\nA Randomised Clinical Trial of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of VRC07-523LS Administered via Different Routes and Doses (HVTN 127/HPTN 087)\nAuthors: Walsh, S. R.; Gay, C. L.; Karuna, S. T.; Hyrien, O.; Skalland, T.; Mayer, K. H.; Sobieszczyk, M. E.; Baden, L. R.; Goepfert, P. A.; del Rio, C.; Pantaleo, G.; Andrew, P.; Karg, C.; He, Z.; Lu, H.; Paez, C.

D.; Montefiori, D. C.; Gama, L.; Mascola, J. R.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.23299799\nBackgroundBroadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a promising approach for HIV-1 prevention. In the only bnAb HIV prevention efficacy studies to date, the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials, a CD4-binding site targeting bnAb, VRC01, administered intravenously (IV), demonstrated 75% prevention efficacy against highly neutralization-sensitive viruses but was ineffective against less sensitive viruses. Greater efficacy is required before passively administered bnAbs become a viable option for HIV prevention; furthermore subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) administration may be preferred. VRC07-523LS is a next-generation bnAb targeting the CD4-binding site and was engineered for increased neutralization breadth and half-life. MethodsParticipants were recruited between 02 February 2018 and 09 October 2018. 124 healthy participants without HIV were randomized to receive five VRC07-523LS administrations via IV (T1: 2.5 mg/kg, T2: 5 mg/kg, T3: 20 mg/kg), SC (T4: 2.5 mg/kg, T5: 5 mg/kg) or IM (T6: 2.5 mg/kg or P6: placebo) routes at four-month intervals. Safety data were collected for 144 weeks following the first administration. VRC07-523LS serum concentrations were measured by ELISA after the first dose through Day 112 in all participants and by binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) thereafter in 60 participants (10 per treatment group) through Day 784. Compartmental population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were conducted to evaluate the VRC07-523LS serum pharmacokinetics. Neutralization activity was measured in a TZM-bl assay and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assayed using a tiered bridging assay testing strategy. ResultsInjections were well-tolerated, with mild pain or tenderness reported commonly in the SC and IM groups, and mild to moderate erythema or induration reported commonly in the SC groups. Infusions were generally well-tolerated, with infusion reactions reported in 3 of 20 participants in the 20 mg/kg IV group. Peak geometric mean (GM) concentrations (95% confidence intervals) following the first administration were 29.0 g/mL (25.2, 33.4), 58.5 g/mL (49.4, 69.3), and 257.2 g/mL (127.5, 518.9) in T1-T3 with IV dosing; 10.8 g/mL (8.8, 13.3) and 22.8 g/mL (20.1, 25.9) in T4-T5 with SC dosing; and 16.4 g/mL (14.7, 18.2) in T6 with IM dosing. Trough GM concentrations immediately prior to the second administration were 3.4 g/mL (2.5, 4.6), 6.5 g/mL (5.6, 7.5), and 27.2 g/mL (23.9, 31.0) with IV dosing; 0.97 g/mL (0.65, 1.4) and 3.1 g/mL (2.2, 4.3) with SC dosing, and 2.6 g/mL (2.05, 3.31) with IM dosing. Peak VRC07-523LS serum concentrations increased linearly with the administered dose. At a given dose, peak and trough concentrations, as well as serum neutralization titres, were highest in the IV groups, reflecting the lower bioavailability following SC and IM administration. A single participant was found to have low titre ADA at a lone timepoint. VRC07-523LS has an estimated mean half-life of 42 days (95% CI: 40.5, 43.5), approximately twice as long as VRC01. ConclusionsVRC07-523LS was safe and well-tolerated across a range of doses and routes and is a promising long-acting bnAb for inclusion in HIV-1 prevention regimens.\nExposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that cross the blood-brain barrier and the risk of dementia among patients with human immunodeficiency virus\nAuthors: Cummings, T. H.; Magagnoli, J.; Sikirzhytskaya, A.; Tyagin, I.; Safro, I.; Wyatt, M. D.; SHTUTMAN, M.; Sutton, S. S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.24301275\nMore than one million people in the United States and over 38 million people worldwide are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly improves the health of people living with HIV (PLWH); however, the increased life longevity of PLWH has revealed consequences of HIV-associated comorbidities. HIV can enter the brain and cause inflammation even in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection. The quality of life for PLWH can be compromised by cognitive deficits and memory loss, termed HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HIV-associated dementia is a related but distinct diagnosis. Common causes of dementia in PLWH are similar to the general population and can affect cognition. There is an urgent need to identify treatments for the aging PWLH population. We previously developed AI-based biomedical literature mining systems to uncover a potential novel connection between HAND the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), which is a pharmacological target for hypertension. RAAS-targeting anti-hypertensives are gaining attention for their protective benefits in several neurocognitive disorders. To our knowledge, the effect of RAAS-targeting drugs on the cognition of PLWH development of dementia has not previously been analyzed. We hypothesized that exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) reduces the risk/occurrence of dementia in PLWH. We report a retrospective cohort study of electronic health records (EHRs) to examine the proposed hypothesis using data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, in which a primary outcome of dementia was measured in controlled cohorts of patients exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi versus those unexposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. The results reveal a statistically significant reduction in dementia diagnosis for PLWH exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. These results suggest there is a potential protective effect of BBB ACE inhibitor exposure against dementia in PLWH that warrants further investigation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe and effective medication for preventing HIV acquisition. We examined Australian general practitioners (GP) knowledge of PrEP efficacy, characteristics associated with ever prescribing PrEP, and barriers to prescribing.

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBroadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a promising approach for HIV-1 prevention. In the only bnAb HIV prevention efficacy studies to date, the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials, a CD4-binding site targeting bnAb, VRC01, administered intravenously (IV), demonstrated 75% prevention efficacy against highly neutralization-sensitive viruses but was ineffective against less sensitive viruses. Greater efficacy is required before passively administered bnAbs become a viable option for HIV prevention; furthermore subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) administration may be preferred. VRC07-523LS is a next-generation bnAb targeting the CD4-binding site and was engineered for increased neutralization breadth and half-life.

MethodsParticipants were recruited between 02 February 2018 and 09 October 2018. 124 healthy participants without HIV were randomized to receive five VRC07-523LS administrations via IV (T1: 2.5 mg/kg, T2: 5 mg/kg, T3: 20 mg/kg), SC (T4: 2.5 mg/kg, T5: 5 mg/kg) or IM (T6: 2.5 mg/kg or P6: placebo) routes at four-month intervals. Safety data were collected for 144 weeks following the first administration. VRC07-523LS serum concentrations were measured by ELISA after the first dose through Day 112 in all participants and by binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA) thereafter in 60 participants (10 per treatment group) through Day 784. Compartmental population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were conducted to evaluate the VRC07-523LS serum pharmacokinetics. Neutralization activity was measured in a TZM-bl assay and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were assayed using a tiered bridging assay testing strategy.

ResultsInjections were well-tolerated, with mild pain or tenderness reported commonly in the SC and IM groups, and mild to moderate erythema or induration reported commonly in the SC groups. Infusions were generally well-tolerated, with infusion reactions reported in 3 of 20 participants in the 20 mg/kg IV group. Peak geometric mean (GM) concentrations (95% confidence intervals) following the first administration were 29.0 g/mL (25.2, 33.4), 58.5 g/mL (49.4, 69.3), and 257.2 g/mL (127.5, 518.9) in T1-T3 with IV dosing; 10.8 g/mL (8.8, 13.3) and 22.8 g/mL (20.1, 25.9) in T4-T5 with SC dosing; and 16.4 g/mL (14.7, 18.2) in T6 with IM dosing. Trough GM concentrations immediately prior to the second administration were 3.4 g/mL (2.5, 4.6), 6.5 g/mL (5.6, 7.5), and 27.2 g/mL (23.9, 31.0) with IV dosing; 0.97 g/mL (0.65, 1.4) and 3.1 g/mL (2.2, 4.3) with SC dosing, and 2.6 g/mL (2.05, 3.31) with IM dosing. Peak VRC07-523LS serum concentrations increased linearly with the administered dose. At a given dose, peak and trough concentrations, as well as serum neutralization titres, were highest in the IV groups, reflecting the lower bioavailability following SC and IM administration. A single participant was found to have low titre ADA at a lone timepoint. VRC07-523LS has an estimated mean half-life of 42 days (95% CI: 40.5, 43.5), approximately twice as long as VRC01.

ConclusionsVRC07-523LS was safe and well-tolerated across a range of doses and routes and is a promising long-acting bnAb for inclusion in HIV-1 prevention regimens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">More than one million people in the United States and over 38 million people worldwide are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly improves the health of people living with HIV (PLWH); however, the increased life longevity of PLWH has revealed consequences of HIV-associated comorbidities. HIV can enter the brain and cause inflammation even in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection. The quality of life for PLWH can be compromised by cognitive deficits and memory loss, termed HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HIV-associated dementia is a related but distinct diagnosis. Common causes of dementia in PLWH are similar to the general population and can affect cognition. There is an urgent need to identify treatments for the aging PWLH population. We previously developed AI-based biomedical literature mining systems to uncover a potential novel connection between HAND the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), which is a pharmacological target for hypertension. RAAS-targeting anti-hypertensives are gaining attention for their protective benefits in several neurocognitive disorders. To our knowledge, the effect of RAAS-targeting drugs on the cognition of PLWH development of dementia has not previously been analyzed. We hypothesized that exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) that cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) reduces the risk/occurrence of dementia in PLWH. We report a retrospective cohort study of electronic health records (EHRs) to examine the proposed hypothesis using data from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, in which a primary outcome of dementia was measured in controlled cohorts of patients exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi versus those unexposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. The results reveal a statistically significant reduction in dementia diagnosis for PLWH exposed to BBB-penetrant ACEi. These results suggest there is a potential protective effect of BBB ACE inhibitor exposure against dementia in PLWH that warrants further investigation.</p>
