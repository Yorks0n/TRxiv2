M.\nScore: 45.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551123\nAs tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.\nA conserved fertilization complex of Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 mediates sperm-egg interaction in vertebrates\nAuthors: Deneke, V. E.; Blaha, A.; Lu, Y.; Draper, J. M.; Phan, C. S.; Panser, K.; Schleiffer, A.; Jacob, L.; Humer, T.; Stejskal, K.; Krssakova, G.; Handler, D.; Kamoshita, M.; Vance, T. D. R.; Roitinger, E.; Lee, J. E.; Ikawa, M.; Pauli, A.\nScore: 46.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550750\nFertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.\nDevelopment of a hepatic cryoinjury model to study liver regeneration\nAuthors: Sande-Melon, M.; Bergemann, D.; Gonzalez-Rosa, J. M.; Cox, A. G.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550437\nThe liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

K.; Negro, D.; Munro, V. M.; Marshall, H. L.; Kozic, Z.; Brown, M.; Beltran, M.; Henderson, N.; Price, D. J.; Mason, J. O.\nScore: 14.6, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551262\nThe transcription factor PAX6 is a crucial regulator of multiple aspects of embryonic forebrain development. Its well-known roles in mice include regulating differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the embryonic cortex. PAX6s roles during human forebrain development are less well understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we investigated PAX6s roles in human neurodevelopment. Homozygous PAX6 mutant (PAX6-/-) organoids were larger than controls and contained inhibitory cell types not found in PAX6+/+ controls. These inhibitory cells exhibited clear transcriptomic similarities and comparable distribution to analogous inhibitory cells previously described in Pax6-/- mice. Differentiation trajectory inferencing showed that the inhibitory cells were generated from both radial glia and neuroectodermal progenitor populations. Inferring cell-cell communication using CellChat showed that loss of PAX6 in cerebral organoids increased the probability of cells engaging with inappropriate signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that while PAX6s role in controlling excitatory versus inhibitory neural differentiation is conserved, there are alterations in the activities of intercellular signalling pathways in human PAX6-/- cortical progenitors that have not been described in mice, indicating potential species-specific mechanistic differences. Summary StatementTo identify likely roles of PAX6 during human embryonic development, we generated and analysed human PAX6 mutant cerebral organoids, revealing strong similarities and some differences to Pax6s well-known roles in rodents.\nHeterogeneity and Functional Analysis of Cardiac Fibroblasts in Heart Development\nAuthors: Deng, Y.; He, Y.; Xu, J.; He, H.; Li, G.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551164\nBackgroundAs one of the major cell types in the heart, fibroblasts play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Cardiac fibroblasts are known to develop from multiple sources, but their transcriptional profiles have not been systematically compared. Furthermore, while the function of a few genes in cardiac fibroblasts has been studied, the overall function of fibroblasts as a cell type remains uninvestigated. MethodsSingle-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze the genome-wide genes expression and extracellular matrix genes expression in fibroblasts, as well as the ligand-receptor interactions between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Single molecular in situ hybridization was employed to analyze the expression pattern of fibroblast subpopulation-specific genes. The Diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system was utilized to ablate fibroblasts at each developmental phase. ResultsUsing RNA staining of Col1a1 at different stages, we grouped cardiac fibroblasts into four developmental phases. Through the analysis of scRNA-seq profiles of fibroblasts at 18 stages from two mouse strains, we identified significant heterogeneity, preserving lineage gene expression in their precursor cells. Within the main fibroblast population, we found differential expressions of Wt1, Tbx18, and Aldh1a2 genes in various cell clusters. Lineage tracing studies showed Wt1- and Tbx18-positive fibroblasts originated from respective epicardial cells. Furthermore, using a conditional DTA system-based elimination, we identified the crucial role of fibroblasts in early embryonic and heart growth, but not in neonatal heart growth. Additionally, we identified the zone- and stage-associated expression of extracellular matrix genes and fibroblast-cardiomyocyte ligand-receptor interactions. This comprehensive understanding sheds light on fibroblast function in heart development. ConclusionWe observed cardiac fibroblast heterogeneity at embryonic and neonatal stages, with preserved lineage gene expression. Ablation studies revealed their distinct roles during development, likely influenced by varying extracellular matrix genes and ligand-receptor interactions at different stages.\nMacrophages heterogeneity and significance during human fetal pancreatic development\nAuthors: Migliorini, A.; Ge, S.; Atkins, M. H.; Sambathkumar, R.; Sing, A.; Chua, C.; Gehring, A. J.; Keller, G. M.; Notta, F.; Nostro, M. C.\nScore: 28.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.549142\nOrganogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW)1,2, but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.\nThe piRNA protein Asz1 is essential for germ cell and gonad development in in zebrafish and exhibits differential necessities in distinct types of RNP granules\nAuthors: Ahmad, A.; Bogoch, Y.; Shvaizer, G.; Elkouby, Y. M.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549483\nGerm cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology. Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.\nC. elegans Afadin is required for epidermal morphogenesis and functionally interfaces with the cadherin-catenin complex and RhoGAP PAC-1/ARHGAP21\nAuthors: Hall, A. E.; Klompstra, D.; Nance, J.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551013\nDuring epithelial morphogenesis, the apical junctions connecting cells must remodel as cells change shape and make new connections with their neighbors. In the C. elegans embryo, new apical junctions form when epidermal cells migrate and seal with one another to encase the embryo in skin ( ventral enclosure), and junctions remodel when epidermal cells change shape to squeeze the embryo into a worm shape ( elongation). The junctional cadherin-catenin complex (CCC), which links epithelial cells to each other and to cortical actomyosin, is essential for C. elegans epidermal morphogenesis. RNAi genetic enhancement screens have identified several proteins that interact with the CCC to promote epidermal morphogenesis, including the scaffolding protein Afadin (AFD-1), whose depletion alone results in only minor morphogenesis defects. Here, by creating a null mutation in afd-1, we show that afd-1 provides a significant contribution to ventral enclosure and elongation on its own. Unexpectedly, we find that afd-1 mutant phenotypes are strongly modified by diet, revealing a previously unappreciated maternal nutritional input to morphogenesis. We identify functional interactions between AFD-1 and the CCC by demonstrating that E-cadherin is required for the polarized distribution of AFD-1 to cell contact sites in early embryos. Finally, we show that afd-1 promotes the enrichment of polarity regulator and CCC-interacting protein PAC-1/ARHGAP21 to cell contact sites, and identify genetic interactions suggesting that afd-1 and pac-1 regulate epidermal morphogenesis at least in part through parallel mechanisms. Our findings reveal that C. elegans AFD-1 makes a significant contribution to epidermal morphogenesis and functionally interfaces with core and associated CCC proteins.\nConnexin 41.8 mediates the correct temporal induction of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells\nAuthors: Petzold, T.; Watanabe, M.; BERTRAND, J. Y.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550806\nHaematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2 (Hif1/2), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.\nMutational profile of the regenerative process and de novo genome assembly of the planarian Schmidtea polychroa\nAuthors: Vermezovic, J.; Poti, A.; Szuts, D.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549885\nPlanarians are organisms with a unique capacity to regenerate any part of their body. New tissues are generated in a process that requires many swift cell divisions. How costly is this process to an animal in terms of mutational load remains unknown. Using whole genome sequencing, we defined the mutational profile of the process of regeneration in the planarian species Schmidtea polychroa. We assembled de novo the genome of S. polychroa and analyzed mutations in animals that have undergone regeneration. We observed a threefold increase in the number of mutations and an altered mutational spectrum. High allele frequencies of subclonal mutations in regenerated animals suggested that relatively few stem cells with high expansion potential regenerated the animal. We provide, for the first time, the draft genome assembly of S. polychroa, an estimation of the germline mutation rate for a planarian species and the mutational spectrum of the regeneration process of a living organism.\n",

        <p class="abstract">As tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

        <p class="abstract">The transcription factor PAX6 is a crucial regulator of multiple aspects of embryonic forebrain development. Its well-known roles in mice include regulating differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the embryonic cortex. PAX6s roles during human forebrain development are less well understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we investigated PAX6s roles in human neurodevelopment. Homozygous PAX6 mutant (PAX6-/-) organoids were larger than controls and contained inhibitory cell types not found in PAX6&#43;/&#43; controls. These inhibitory cells exhibited clear transcriptomic similarities and comparable distribution to analogous inhibitory cells previously described in Pax6-/- mice. Differentiation trajectory inferencing showed that the inhibitory cells were generated from both radial glia and neuroectodermal progenitor populations. Inferring cell-cell communication using CellChat showed that loss of PAX6 in cerebral organoids increased the probability of cells engaging with inappropriate signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that while PAX6s role in controlling excitatory versus inhibitory neural differentiation is conserved, there are alterations in the activities of intercellular signalling pathways in human PAX6-/- cortical progenitors that have not been described in mice, indicating potential species-specific mechanistic differences.

Summary StatementTo identify likely roles of PAX6 during human embryonic development, we generated and analysed human PAX6 mutant cerebral organoids, revealing strong similarities and some differences to Pax6s well-known roles in rodents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAs one of the major cell types in the heart, fibroblasts play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Cardiac fibroblasts are known to develop from multiple sources, but their transcriptional profiles have not been systematically compared. Furthermore, while the function of a few genes in cardiac fibroblasts has been studied, the overall function of fibroblasts as a cell type remains uninvestigated.

MethodsSingle-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze the genome-wide genes expression and extracellular matrix genes expression in fibroblasts, as well as the ligand-receptor interactions between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Single molecular in situ hybridization was employed to analyze the expression pattern of fibroblast subpopulation-specific genes. The Diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system was utilized to ablate fibroblasts at each developmental phase.

ResultsUsing RNA staining of Col1a1 at different stages, we grouped cardiac fibroblasts into four developmental phases. Through the analysis of scRNA-seq profiles of fibroblasts at 18 stages from two mouse strains, we identified significant heterogeneity, preserving lineage gene expression in their precursor cells. Within the main fibroblast population, we found differential expressions of Wt1, Tbx18, and Aldh1a2 genes in various cell clusters. Lineage tracing studies showed Wt1- and Tbx18-positive fibroblasts originated from respective epicardial cells. Furthermore, using a conditional DTA system-based elimination, we identified the crucial role of fibroblasts in early embryonic and heart growth, but not in neonatal heart growth. Additionally, we identified the zone- and stage-associated expression of extracellular matrix genes and fibroblast-cardiomyocyte ligand-receptor interactions. This comprehensive understanding sheds light on fibroblast function in heart development.

ConclusionWe observed cardiac fibroblast heterogeneity at embryonic and neonatal stages, with preserved lineage gene expression. Ablation studies revealed their distinct roles during development, likely influenced by varying extracellular matrix genes and ligand-receptor interactions at different stages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW)1,2, but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germ cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology.

Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During epithelial morphogenesis, the apical junctions connecting cells must remodel as cells change shape and make new connections with their neighbors. In the C. elegans embryo, new apical junctions form when epidermal cells migrate and seal with one another to encase the embryo in skin ( ventral enclosure), and junctions remodel when epidermal cells change shape to squeeze the embryo into a worm shape ( elongation). The junctional cadherin-catenin complex (CCC), which links epithelial cells to each other and to cortical actomyosin, is essential for C. elegans epidermal morphogenesis. RNAi genetic enhancement screens have identified several proteins that interact with the CCC to promote epidermal morphogenesis, including the scaffolding protein Afadin (AFD-1), whose depletion alone results in only minor morphogenesis defects. Here, by creating a null mutation in afd-1, we show that afd-1 provides a significant contribution to ventral enclosure and elongation on its own. Unexpectedly, we find that afd-1 mutant phenotypes are strongly modified by diet, revealing a previously unappreciated maternal nutritional input to morphogenesis. We identify functional interactions between AFD-1 and the CCC by demonstrating that E-cadherin is required for the polarized distribution of AFD-1 to cell contact sites in early embryos. Finally, we show that afd-1 promotes the enrichment of polarity regulator and CCC-interacting protein PAC-1/ARHGAP21 to cell contact sites, and identify genetic interactions suggesting that afd-1 and pac-1 regulate epidermal morphogenesis at least in part through parallel mechanisms. Our findings reveal that C. elegans AFD-1 makes a significant contribution to epidermal morphogenesis and functionally interfaces with core and associated CCC proteins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2 (Hif1/2), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Planarians are organisms with a unique capacity to regenerate any part of their body. New tissues are generated in a process that requires many swift cell divisions. How costly is this process to an animal in terms of mutational load remains unknown. Using whole genome sequencing, we defined the mutational profile of the process of regeneration in the planarian species Schmidtea polychroa. We assembled de novo the genome of S. polychroa and analyzed mutations in animals that have undergone regeneration. We observed a threefold increase in the number of mutations and an altered mutational spectrum. High allele frequencies of subclonal mutations in regenerated animals suggested that relatively few stem cells with high expansion potential regenerated the animal. We provide, for the first time, the draft genome assembly of S. polychroa, an estimation of the germline mutation rate for a planarian species and the mutational spectrum of the regeneration process of a living organism.</p>
