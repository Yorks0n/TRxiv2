Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.\nIntegrated Molecular-Phenotypic Profiling Reveals Metabolic Control of Morphological Variation in Stembryos\nAuthors: Villaronga Luque, A.; Savill, R. G.; Lopez-Anguita, N.; Bolondi, A.; Garai, S.; Gassaloglu, S. I.; Poddar, A.; Bulut-Karslioglu, A.; Veenvliet, J. V.\nScore: 49.6, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569921\nMammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.

O.; McCarty, O. J.; Wu, P.-H.; Rosenberg, A.; Wirtz, D.; Kiemen, A. L.\nScore: 29.6, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570622\nKidneys are among the most structurally complex organs in the body. Their architecture is critical to ensure proper function and is often impacted by diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Understanding the spatial interplay between the different structures of the nephron and renal vasculature is crucial. Recent efforts have demonstrated the value of three-dimensional (3D) imaging in revealing new insights into the various components of the kidney; however, these studies used antibodies or autofluorescence to detect structures and so were limited in their ability to compare the many subtle structures of the kidney at once. Here, through 3D reconstruction of fetal rhesus macaque kidneys at cellular resolution, we demonstrate the power of deep learning in exhaustively labelling seventeen microstructures of the kidney. Using these tissue maps, we interrogate the spatial distribution and spatial correlation of the glomeruli, renal arteries, and the nephron. This work demonstrates the power of deep learning applied to 3D tissue images to improve our ability to compare many microanatomical structures at once, paving the way for further works investigating renal pathologies.\nNanos2+ cells give rise to germline and somatic lineages in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis\nAuthors: Denner, A.; Steger, J.; Ries, A.; Morozova-Link, E.; Ritter, J.; Haas, F.; Cole, A. G.; Technau, U.\nScore: 28.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570436\nIn all animals, stem cell populations of varying potency facilitate regeneration and tissue homeostasis. Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, such as nanos, vasa and piwi. Interestingly, in animals, which are capable of whole-body regeneration, such as poriferans, hydrozoans and planarians, these genes are also expressed in somatic multi- and pluripotent stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. While multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have been identified in hydrozoans, they have not unambiguously been demonstrated in other cnidarian classes. Therefore, it is currently unclear if these stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin or have been adapted individually in different lineages as homoplasy. We therefore aimed to characterize stem cells expressing conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, to gain insight of shared traits governing the regulation of this enigmatic cell type. Through single cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline associated markers piwi1 and nanos2 in the soma and germline. Transgenic reporter genes reveal a lineage giving rise to somatic cells, consistent with a role as a multipotent stem cell population. Cell proliferation studies show that a fraction of nanos2+ reporter cells are cycling and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout show that nanos2+ progenitor cells are indispensable for male and female germline maintenance in Nematostella. This suggests nanos and piwi genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.\nInvestigating the impact of paternal aging on murine sperm miRNA profiles and their potential link to autism spectrum disorder\nAuthors: Miyahara, K.; Tatehana, M.; Kikkawa, T.; Osumi, N.\nScore: 21.3, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.01.543326\nPaternal aging has consistently been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Recent evidence has highlighted the involvement of epigenetic factors. In this study, we aimed to investigate age-related alterations in microRNA (miRNA) profiles of mouse sperm and analyze target genes regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). Microarray analyses were conducted on sperm samples from mice at different ages: 3 months (3 M), over 12 M, and beyond 20 M. We identified 26 miRNAs with differential expression between the 3 M and 20 M mice, 34 miRNAs between the 12 M and 20 M mice, and 2 miRNAs between the 3 M and 12 M mice. The target genes regulated by these miRNAs were significantly associated with apoptosis/ferroptosis pathways and the nervous system. We revealed alterations in sperm miRNA profiles due to aging and suggest that the target genes regulated by these DEmiRNAs are associated with apoptosis and the nervous system, implying a potential link between paternal aging and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. The observed age-related changes in sperm miRNA profiles have the potential to impact sperm quality and subsequently affect offspring development.\nDevelopment of Pial Collaterals by Extension of Pre-existing Artery Tips\nAuthors: Kumar, S.; Shanavas, N.; Ghosh, S.; Sivaramakrishnan, V.; Dwari, M.; Das, S.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570539\nPial collaterals provide protection from ischemic damage and improve prognosis of stroke patients. The origin or precise sequence of events underlying pial collateral development is unclear and has prevented clinicians from adapting new vascularization and regeneration therapies. We use genetic lineage tracing and intravital imaging of mouse brains at cellular resolution to show that during embryogenesis, pial collateral arteries develop from extension and anastomoses of pre-existing artery tips in a VegfR2 dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that an arterial receptor, Cxcr4, earlier shown to drive artery cell migration and coronary collateral development, is dispensable for formation and maintenance of pial collateral arteries. Our study reveals that collateral arteries of the brain are built by a unique mechanism, distinct from that of the heart.\nMechanical strengthening of cell-cell adhesion during mouse embryo compaction\nAuthors: de Plater, L.; Firmin, J.; Maitre, J.-L.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570568\nCompaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density.\nTradeoff Between Speed and Robustness in Primordium Initiation Mediated by Auxin-CUC1 Interaction\nAuthors: Kong, S.; Zhu, M.; Pan, D.; Lane, B.; Smith, R. S.; Roeder, A. H. K.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569401\nRobustness is the reproducible development of a phenotype despite stochastic noise. It often involves tradeoffs with other performance metrics, but the mechanisms underlying such tradeoffs were largely unknown. An Arabidopsis flower robustly develops four sepals from four precisely positioned auxin maxima. The development related myb-like 1 (drmy1) mutant generates stochastic noise in auxin signaling that disrupts both the robust position and number of sepal primordia. Here, we found that increased expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), a boundary specification transcription factor, in the drmy1 mutant underlies this loss of robustness. CUC1 surrounds and amplifies stochastic auxin patches in drmy1 to form variably positioned auxin maxima and sepal primordia. Removing CUC1 from drmy1 provides time for the noise in auxin signaling to resolve into four precisely positioned auxin maxima, restoring robust sepal initiation. However, removing CUC1 decreases auxin maxima intensity and slows down sepal initiation. Thus, CUC1 increases morphogenesis speed but impairs robustness against auxin noise. Further, using a computational model, we found that the observed phenotype can be explained by the effect of CUC1 in repolarizing PIN FORMED1 (PIN1), a polar auxin transporter. Thus, our study illustrates a tradeoff between speed and robustness during development.\nA temporal allocation of amino acid resources ensures fitness and body allometry\nAuthors: Valzania, L.; Alami, A.; Leopold, P.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570599\nOrganisms have evolved strategies to store resources and overcome periods of low or no nutrient access including transient shortages or longer non-feeding developmental transitions. Holometabolous insects like Drosophila represent an attractive model to study resource allocation during development since they alternate feeding and non-feeding periods. Amino acids are essential components for tissue growth and renewal, but the strategies used for their storage remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a 2-step mechanism for the temporal production, storage and use of specific storage proteins called hexamerins. Moreover, we show that modulating amino acid storage affects the relative growth of organs across developmental phases and, as a consequence, alters body allometry and adult fitness.\nA niche-derived non-ribosomal peptide triggers planarian sexual development\nAuthors: Issigonis, M.; Browder, K. L.; Chen, R.; Collins, J. J.; Newmark, P. A.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570471\nGerm cells are regulated by local microenvironments (niches), which secrete instructive cues. Conserved developmental signaling molecules act as niche-derived regulatory factors, yet other types of niche signals remain to be identified. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of sexual planarians revealed niche cells expressing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps). Inhibiting nrps led to loss of female reproductive organs and testis hyperplasia. Mass spectrometry detected the dipeptide {beta}-alanyl-tryptamine (BATT), which is associated with reproductive system development and requires nrps and a monoamine-transmitter-synthetic enzyme (AADC) for its production. Exogenous BATT rescued the reproductive defects after nrps or aadc inhibition, restoring fertility. Thus, a non-ribosomal, monoamine-derived peptide provided by niche cells acts as a critical signal to trigger planarian reproductive development. These findings reveal an unexpected function for monoamines in niche-germ cell signaling. Furthermore, given the recently reported role for BATT as a male-derived factor required for reproductive maturation of female schistosomes, these results have important implications for the evolution of parasitic flatworms and suggest a potential role for non-ribosomal peptides as signaling molecules in other organisms.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During embryonic development, cells exit pluripotency to give rise to the three germ layers. Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.

        <p class="abstract">Kidneys are among the most structurally complex organs in the body. Their architecture is critical to ensure proper function and is often impacted by diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Understanding the spatial interplay between the different structures of the nephron and renal vasculature is crucial. Recent efforts have demonstrated the value of three-dimensional (3D) imaging in revealing new insights into the various components of the kidney; however, these studies used antibodies or autofluorescence to detect structures and so were limited in their ability to compare the many subtle structures of the kidney at once. Here, through 3D reconstruction of fetal rhesus macaque kidneys at cellular resolution, we demonstrate the power of deep learning in exhaustively labelling seventeen microstructures of the kidney. Using these tissue maps, we interrogate the spatial distribution and spatial correlation of the glomeruli, renal arteries, and the nephron. This work demonstrates the power of deep learning applied to 3D tissue images to improve our ability to compare many microanatomical structures at once, paving the way for further works investigating renal pathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In all animals, stem cell populations of varying potency facilitate regeneration and tissue homeostasis. Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, such as nanos, vasa and piwi. Interestingly, in animals, which are capable of whole-body regeneration, such as poriferans, hydrozoans and planarians, these genes are also expressed in somatic multi- and pluripotent stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. While multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have been identified in hydrozoans, they have not unambiguously been demonstrated in other cnidarian classes. Therefore, it is currently unclear if these stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin or have been adapted individually in different lineages as homoplasy. We therefore aimed to characterize stem cells expressing conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, to gain insight of shared traits governing the regulation of this enigmatic cell type. Through single cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline associated markers piwi1 and nanos2 in the soma and germline. Transgenic reporter genes reveal a lineage giving rise to somatic cells, consistent with a role as a multipotent stem cell population. Cell proliferation studies show that a fraction of nanos2&#43; reporter cells are cycling and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout show that nanos2&#43; progenitor cells are indispensable for male and female germline maintenance in Nematostella. This suggests nanos and piwi genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Paternal aging has consistently been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in offspring. Recent evidence has highlighted the involvement of epigenetic factors. In this study, we aimed to investigate age-related alterations in microRNA (miRNA) profiles of mouse sperm and analyze target genes regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). Microarray analyses were conducted on sperm samples from mice at different ages: 3 months (3 M), over 12 M, and beyond 20 M. We identified 26 miRNAs with differential expression between the 3 M and 20 M mice, 34 miRNAs between the 12 M and 20 M mice, and 2 miRNAs between the 3 M and 12 M mice. The target genes regulated by these miRNAs were significantly associated with apoptosis/ferroptosis pathways and the nervous system. We revealed alterations in sperm miRNA profiles due to aging and suggest that the target genes regulated by these DEmiRNAs are associated with apoptosis and the nervous system, implying a potential link between paternal aging and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. The observed age-related changes in sperm miRNA profiles have the potential to impact sperm quality and subsequently affect offspring development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pial collaterals provide protection from ischemic damage and improve prognosis of stroke patients. The origin or precise sequence of events underlying pial collateral development is unclear and has prevented clinicians from adapting new vascularization and regeneration therapies. We use genetic lineage tracing and intravital imaging of mouse brains at cellular resolution to show that during embryogenesis, pial collateral arteries develop from extension and anastomoses of pre-existing artery tips in a VegfR2 dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that an arterial receptor, Cxcr4, earlier shown to drive artery cell migration and coronary collateral development, is dispensable for formation and maintenance of pial collateral arteries. Our study reveals that collateral arteries of the brain are built by a unique mechanism, distinct from that of the heart.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Robustness is the reproducible development of a phenotype despite stochastic noise. It often involves tradeoffs with other performance metrics, but the mechanisms underlying such tradeoffs were largely unknown. An Arabidopsis flower robustly develops four sepals from four precisely positioned auxin maxima. The development related myb-like 1 (drmy1) mutant generates stochastic noise in auxin signaling that disrupts both the robust position and number of sepal primordia. Here, we found that increased expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), a boundary specification transcription factor, in the drmy1 mutant underlies this loss of robustness. CUC1 surrounds and amplifies stochastic auxin patches in drmy1 to form variably positioned auxin maxima and sepal primordia. Removing CUC1 from drmy1 provides time for the noise in auxin signaling to resolve into four precisely positioned auxin maxima, restoring robust sepal initiation. However, removing CUC1 decreases auxin maxima intensity and slows down sepal initiation. Thus, CUC1 increases morphogenesis speed but impairs robustness against auxin noise. Further, using a computational model, we found that the observed phenotype can be explained by the effect of CUC1 in repolarizing PIN FORMED1 (PIN1), a polar auxin transporter. Thus, our study illustrates a tradeoff between speed and robustness during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms have evolved strategies to store resources and overcome periods of low or no nutrient access including transient shortages or longer non-feeding developmental transitions. Holometabolous insects like Drosophila represent an attractive model to study resource allocation during development since they alternate feeding and non-feeding periods. Amino acids are essential components for tissue growth and renewal, but the strategies used for their storage remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a 2-step mechanism for the temporal production, storage and use of specific storage proteins called hexamerins. Moreover, we show that modulating amino acid storage affects the relative growth of organs across developmental phases and, as a consequence, alters body allometry and adult fitness.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germ cells are regulated by local microenvironments (niches), which secrete instructive cues. Conserved developmental signaling molecules act as niche-derived regulatory factors, yet other types of niche signals remain to be identified. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of sexual planarians revealed niche cells expressing a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps). Inhibiting nrps led to loss of female reproductive organs and testis hyperplasia. Mass spectrometry detected the dipeptide {beta}-alanyl-tryptamine (BATT), which is associated with reproductive system development and requires nrps and a monoamine-transmitter-synthetic enzyme (AADC) for its production. Exogenous BATT rescued the reproductive defects after nrps or aadc inhibition, restoring fertility. Thus, a non-ribosomal, monoamine-derived peptide provided by niche cells acts as a critical signal to trigger planarian reproductive development. These findings reveal an unexpected function for monoamines in niche-germ cell signaling. Furthermore, given the recently reported role for BATT as a male-derived factor required for reproductive maturation of female schistosomes, these results have important implications for the evolution of parasitic flatworms and suggest a potential role for non-ribosomal peptides as signaling molecules in other organisms.</p>
