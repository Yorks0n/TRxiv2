G.; Dias, A.; Lopes, A.; Fowler, D. A.; Martins, G. G.; Novoa, A.; Mallo, M.\nScore: 59.8, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548120\nThe hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.\nPrimordial germ cell DNA demethylation and development require DNA translesion synthesis.\nAuthors: Shah, P.; Hill, R. J.; Clark, S.; Dion, C.; Abakir, A.; Arends, M.; Leitch, H.; Reik, W.; Crossan, G.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547775\nMutations in DNA damage response (DDR) factors are associated with human infertility, which affects up to 15% of the population. It remains unclear if the role of DDR is solely in meiosis. One pathway implicated in human fertility is DNA translesion synthesis (TLS), which allows replication impediments to be bypassed. We find that TLS is essential for pre-meiotic germ cell development in the embryo. Loss of the central TLS component, REV1, significantly inhibits the induction of human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs). This is recapitulated in mice, where deficiencies in TLS initiation (Rev1-/- or PcnaK164R/K164R) or extension (Rev7-/-) result in a \u003e150-fold reduction in the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and complete sterility. In contrast, the absence of TLS does not impact the growth, function, or homeostasis of somatic tissues. Surprisingly, we find a complete failure in both activation of the germ cell transcriptional program and in DNA demethylation, a critical step in germline epigenetic reprogramming. Our findings show that for normal fertility, DNA repair is required not only for meiotic recombination but for progression through the earliest stages of germ cell development in mammals.\nTransgene-Free Ex Utero Derivation of A Human Post-Implantation Embryo Model Solely from Genetically Unmodified Naive PSCs\nAuthors: Oldak, B.; Wildschutz, E.; Bondarenko, V.; Aguilera-Castrejon, A.; Zhao, C.; Tarazi, S.; Comar, M.-Y.; Ashouokhi, S.; Lokshtanov, D.; Roncato, F.; Viukov, S.; Ariel, E.; Rose, M.; Livnat, N.; Shani, T.; Joubran, C.; Cohen, R.; Addadi, Y.; Kedmi, M.; Keren-Shaul, H.; Petropoulos, S.; Lanner, F.; Novershtern, N.; Hanna, J. H.\nScore: 1278.0, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.544922\nOur ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.\nTranscriptional clusters follow a conserved condensation-dispersal sequence during stem cell differentiation\nAuthors: Klingberg, T.; Wachter, I.; Pancholi, A.; Gohar, Y.; Kumar, P.; Sobucki, M.; Kämmer, E.; Eroglu-Kayikci, S.; Erhardt, S.; Ferrai, C.; Zaburdaev, V.; Hilbert, L.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547621\nSpatiotemporal organization of transcription is essential for organism development. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In stem cells, Pol II forms prominent clusters, which gradually disappear during differentiation, such that only smaller clusters remain. Here, we ask whether the formation and loss of large Pol II clusters is a stereotypical process explicable by changes in the Pol II transcriptional state during differentiation. We assess clusters by super-resolution microscopy in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, sperm precursor formation in fruit flies, and germ layer induction in zebrafish. In all cases, Pol II clusters first become larger and rounder, then unfold, and finally disperse into small clusters. These shape changes are accompanied by initial increase in recruited Pol II, subsequent transition into transcript elongation, and finally reduction of active enhancers. We reproduce these observations using a biophysical surface condensation model, where enhancers support Pol II cluster formation, and transcriptional activity unfolds clusters. Our work indicates that changes in enhancer marks and transcriptional activity during differentiation define a stereotyped trajectory through a generally applicable space of cluster shapes.

However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered \"immortal\" due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.\nClonal neural tube organoids self-organise floorplate through BMP-mediated cluster competition\nAuthors: Krammer, T.; Stuart, H. T.; Gromberg, E.; Ishihara, K.; Melchionda, M.; Wang, J.; Costantini, E.; Lehr, S.; Cislo, D.; Arbanas, L.; Hoermann, A.; Neumueller, R. A.; Elvassore, N.; Siggia, E.; Briscoe, J.; Kicheva, A.; Tanaka, E. M.\nScore: 39.9, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546258\nOrganoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2+ floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2+ clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable \"winning\" floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2+ clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2+ cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.\nDistinct features of the regenerating heart uncovered through comparative single-cell profiling\nAuthors: Carey, C. M.; Hollins, H. L.; Schmid, A. V.; Gagnon, J. A.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547574\nAdult humans respond to heart injury by forming a permanent scar, yet other vertebrates are capable of robust and complete cardiac regeneration. Despite progress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish and amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating vertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features truly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared cardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share similar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative capability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-resolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell types across both species. With this approach, we identified several key features that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating medaka ventricle. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell recruitment and a distinct pro- inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes, and an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In addition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and retinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we identified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack embryonic-like primordial layer cardiomyocytes, and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene program shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable variation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in zebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the hidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these seemingly similar vertebrates.\nTransgene directed induction of a stem cell-derived human embryo model\nAuthors: Weatherbee, B. A. T.; Gantner, C. W.; Daza, R. M.; Hamazaki, N.; Iwamoto-Stohl, L. K.; Shendure, J.; Zernicka-Goetz, M.\nScore: 737.6, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545082\nThe human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus, yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryo in vivo. Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.\nGcn5 - mTORC1 - TFEB signalling axis mediated control of autophagy regulates Drosophila blood cell homeostasis\nAuthors: R, A. A.; Math, S.; Kata, L.; Khadilkar, R. J.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547637\nBlood progenitors are regulated by a variety of signals from their environment. In the Drosophila lymph gland (LG), the Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) acts as a stem cell niche striking a balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells. While the response of blood progenitors to extrinsic signals is well characterized, their ability to respond to cell intrinsic cues is unexplored. Autophagy is one such intrinsic cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis by removing unnecessary or dysfunctional cell components through autophagic degradation and recycling. Here, we show that autophagy plays a critical role in regulating blood cell homeostasis in the lymph gland. General control non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5), a histone acetyltransferase is expressed in all the cellular subsets of the LG and modulation of Gcn5 levels in various cellular subsets of the LG perturbs LG homeostasis. Gcn5 through its known non-histone acetylation target, TFEB controls autophagic flux thereby regulating hematopoiesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that modulation of mTORC1 activity can perturb hematopoiesis. We show that Gcn5 acts as a nutrient sensor and mTORC1 activity regulates Gcn5. mTORC1 over-rides the effect exerted by Gcn5 in regulating LG hematopoiesis. Together, our findings indicate that Gcn5 - mTORC1 - TFEB signaling axis mediated control of autophagy is required for maintaining blood cell homeostasis in Drosophila.\nSea lamprey enlightens the origin of the coupling of retinoic acid signaling to vertebrate hindbrain segmentation\nAuthors: Bedois, A.; Parker, H. J.; Bronner, M. E.; Krumlauf, R.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548143\nRetinoic acid (RA) is involved in antero-posterior patterning of the chordate body axis and, in jawed vertebrates, has been shown to play a major role at multiple levels of the gene regulatory network (GRN) regulating hindbrain segmentation. Knowing when and how RA became coupled to the core hindbrain GRN is important for understanding how ancient signaling pathways and patterning genes can evolve and generate diversity. Hence, we investigated the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an important jawless vertebrate model providing clues to decipher ancestral vertebrate features. Combining genomics, gene expression, and functional analyses of major components involved in RA synthesis (Aldh1as) and degradation (Cyp26s), we demonstrate that RA signaling is coupled to hindbrain segmentation in lamprey. Thus, the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation is a pan vertebrate feature of the hindbrain and likely evolved at the base of vertebrates.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) factors are associated with human infertility, which affects up to 15% of the population. It remains unclear if the role of DDR is solely in meiosis. One pathway implicated in human fertility is DNA translesion synthesis (TLS), which allows replication impediments to be bypassed. We find that TLS is essential for pre-meiotic germ cell development in the embryo. Loss of the central TLS component, REV1, significantly inhibits the induction of human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs). This is recapitulated in mice, where deficiencies in TLS initiation (Rev1-/- or PcnaK164R/K164R) or extension (Rev7-/-) result in a &gt;150-fold reduction in the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and complete sterility. In contrast, the absence of TLS does not impact the growth, function, or homeostasis of somatic tissues. Surprisingly, we find a complete failure in both activation of the germ cell transcriptional program and in DNA demethylation, a critical step in germline epigenetic reprogramming. Our findings show that for normal fertility, DNA repair is required not only for meiotic recombination but for progression through the earliest stages of germ cell development in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Our ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatiotemporal organization of transcription is essential for organism development. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In stem cells, Pol II forms prominent clusters, which gradually disappear during differentiation, such that only smaller clusters remain. Here, we ask whether the formation and loss of large Pol II clusters is a stereotypical process explicable by changes in the Pol II transcriptional state during differentiation. We assess clusters by super-resolution microscopy in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, sperm precursor formation in fruit flies, and germ layer induction in zebrafish. In all cases, Pol II clusters first become larger and rounder, then unfold, and finally disperse into small clusters. These shape changes are accompanied by initial increase in recruited Pol II, subsequent transition into transcript elongation, and finally reduction of active enhancers. We reproduce these observations using a biophysical surface condensation model, where enhancers support Pol II cluster formation, and transcriptional activity unfolds clusters. Our work indicates that changes in enhancer marks and transcriptional activity during differentiation define a stereotyped trajectory through a generally applicable space of cluster shapes.

        <p class="abstract">An ability to delay aging--or to reverse the negative effects of aging--could prevent age-related disease and greatly enhance quality of life in old age. However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered &#34;immortal&#34; due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2&#43; floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2&#43; clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable &#34;winning&#34; floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2&#43; clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2&#43; cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult humans respond to heart injury by forming a permanent scar, yet other vertebrates are capable of robust and complete cardiac regeneration. Despite progress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish and amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating vertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features truly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared cardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share similar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative capability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-resolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell types across both species. With this approach, we identified several key features that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating medaka ventricle. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell recruitment and a distinct pro- inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes, and an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In addition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and retinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we identified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack embryonic-like primordial layer cardiomyocytes, and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene program shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable variation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in zebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the hidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these seemingly similar vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus, yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryo in vivo. Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Blood progenitors are regulated by a variety of signals from their environment. In the Drosophila lymph gland (LG), the Posterior Signalling Center (PSC) acts as a stem cell niche striking a balance between progenitors and differentiated blood cells. While the response of blood progenitors to extrinsic signals is well characterized, their ability to respond to cell intrinsic cues is unexplored. Autophagy is one such intrinsic cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis by removing unnecessary or dysfunctional cell components through autophagic degradation and recycling. Here, we show that autophagy plays a critical role in regulating blood cell homeostasis in the lymph gland. General control non-derepressible 5 (Gcn5), a histone acetyltransferase is expressed in all the cellular subsets of the LG and modulation of Gcn5 levels in various cellular subsets of the LG perturbs LG homeostasis. Gcn5 through its known non-histone acetylation target, TFEB controls autophagic flux thereby regulating hematopoiesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that modulation of mTORC1 activity can perturb hematopoiesis. We show that Gcn5 acts as a nutrient sensor and mTORC1 activity regulates Gcn5. mTORC1 over-rides the effect exerted by Gcn5 in regulating LG hematopoiesis. Together, our findings indicate that Gcn5 - mTORC1 - TFEB signaling axis mediated control of autophagy is required for maintaining blood cell homeostasis in Drosophila.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retinoic acid (RA) is involved in antero-posterior patterning of the chordate body axis and, in jawed vertebrates, has been shown to play a major role at multiple levels of the gene regulatory network (GRN) regulating hindbrain segmentation. Knowing when and how RA became coupled to the core hindbrain GRN is important for understanding how ancient signaling pathways and patterning genes can evolve and generate diversity. Hence, we investigated the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an important jawless vertebrate model providing clues to decipher ancestral vertebrate features. Combining genomics, gene expression, and functional analyses of major components involved in RA synthesis (Aldh1as) and degradation (Cyp26s), we demonstrate that RA signaling is coupled to hindbrain segmentation in lamprey. Thus, the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation is a pan vertebrate feature of the hindbrain and likely evolved at the base of vertebrates.</p>
