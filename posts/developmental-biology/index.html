M.\nScore: 42.9, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564423\nUpon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.\nTransposable elements acquire time- and sex-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures along mouse fetal gonad development\nAuthors: Stevant, I.; Gonen, N.; Poulat, F.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563600\nGonadal sex determination in mice is a complex and dynamic process, crucial for the development of functional reproductive organs. The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.\nDivergent evolutionary strategies preempt tissue collision in fly gastrulation\nAuthors: Dey, B.; Kaul, V.; Kale, G.; Scorcelletti, M.; Takeda, M.; Wang, Y.-C.; Lemke, S.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561568\nMetazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.\nSOX2+ sustentacular cells are stem cells of the postnatal adrenal medulla\nAuthors: Santambrogio, A.; Kemkem, Y.; Willis, T. L.; Berger, I.; Kastriti, M. E.; Faure, L.; Russell, J. P.; Lodge, E. J.; Yianni, V.; Oakey, R. J.; Altieri, B.; Bornstein, S. R.; Steenblock, C.; Adameyko, I. I.; Andoniadou, C. L.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.564519\nRenewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2+ cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2+ cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.\nDisrupted endosomal trafficking of the Vangl-Celsr polarity complex causes congenital anomalies in trachea-esophageal separation\nAuthors: Edwards, N. A.; Kashyap, A.; Warren, A.; Agricola, Z.; Kenny, A. P.; Shen, Y.; Chung, W. K.; Zorn, A. M.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561909\nThe developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.\nEmerging cooperativity between Oct4 and Sox2 governs the pluripotency network in mouse embryos\nAuthors: Schöler, H. R.; Hou, Y.; Nie, Z.; Velychko, S.; Bedzhov, I.; Heising, S.; Jiang, Q.; Zhang, H.; Wu, G.; Adachi, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562912\nDuring the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.\nScale-independent topological interactions drive the first fate decision in the Drosophila embryo\nAuthors: Hur, W.; Mukherjee, A.; Hayden, L.; Lu, Z.; Chao, A.; Mitchell, N. P.; Streichan, S. J.; Vergassola, M.; Di Talia, S.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561879\nDuring embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.\nPatterned embryonic invagination evolved in response to mechanical instability\nAuthors: Vellutini, B. C.; Cuenca, M. B.; Krishna, A.; Szałapak, A.; Modes, C. D.; Tomancak, P.\nScore: 24.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534554\nMechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.\nIntegrated Proteomics Identifies Troponin I Isoform Switch as a Regulator of a Sarcomere-Metabolism Axis During Cardiac Regeneration\nAuthors: Aballo, T. J.; Bae, J.; Paltzer, W. G.; Chapman, E. A.; Salamon, R. J.; Mann, M. M.; Ge, Y.; Mahmoud, A. I.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563389\nAdult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.\nOverexpression of mitochondrial fusion genes enhances resilience and extends longevity\nAuthors: Traa, A.; Keil, A.; Rudich, Z.; Zhu, S.; Van Raamsdonk, J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563703\nThe dynamicity of the mitochondrial network is crucial for meeting the ever-changing metabolic and energy needs of the cell. Mitochondrial fission promotes the degradation and distribution of mitochondria, while mitochondrial fusion maintains mitochondrial function through the complementation of mitochondrial components. Previously, we have reported that mitochondrial networks are tubular, interconnected and well-organized in young, healthy C. elegans, but become fragmented and disorganized with advancing age and in models of age-associated neurodegenerative disease. In this work, we examine the effects of increasing mitochondrial fission or mitochondrial fusion capacity by ubiquitously overexpressing the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 or the mitochondrial fusion genes fzo-1 and eat-3, individually or in combination. We then measured mitochondrial function, mitochondrial network morphology, physiologic rates, stress resistance and lifespan. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of either mitochondrial fission or fusion machinery both resulted in an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Similarly, both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion overexpression strains have extended lifespans and increased stress resistance, which appears to be at least partially due to the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways in these strains. Overall, our work demonstrates that increasing the expression of mitochondrial fission or fusion genes extends lifespan and improves biological resilience without promoting the maintenance of a youthful mitochondrial network morphology. This work highlights the importance of the mitochondria for both resilience and longevity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Upon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gonadal sex determination in mice is a complex and dynamic process, crucial for the development of functional reproductive organs. The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Renewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2&#43; cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2&#43; stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2&#43; cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dynamicity of the mitochondrial network is crucial for meeting the ever-changing metabolic and energy needs of the cell. Mitochondrial fission promotes the degradation and distribution of mitochondria, while mitochondrial fusion maintains mitochondrial function through the complementation of mitochondrial components. Previously, we have reported that mitochondrial networks are tubular, interconnected and well-organized in young, healthy C. elegans, but become fragmented and disorganized with advancing age and in models of age-associated neurodegenerative disease. In this work, we examine the effects of increasing mitochondrial fission or mitochondrial fusion capacity by ubiquitously overexpressing the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 or the mitochondrial fusion genes fzo-1 and eat-3, individually or in combination. We then measured mitochondrial function, mitochondrial network morphology, physiologic rates, stress resistance and lifespan. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of either mitochondrial fission or fusion machinery both resulted in an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Similarly, both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion overexpression strains have extended lifespans and increased stress resistance, which appears to be at least partially due to the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways in these strains. Overall, our work demonstrates that increasing the expression of mitochondrial fission or fusion genes extends lifespan and improves biological resilience without promoting the maintenance of a youthful mitochondrial network morphology. This work highlights the importance of the mitochondria for both resilience and longevity.</p>
