For example, stem cell-derived 'gastruloids' form elongating structures containing all three germ layers. However, although elongated, human gastruloids do not morphologically resemble post-implantation embryos. Here we show that a specific, discontinuous regimen of retinoic acid (RA) robustly induces human gastruloids with embryo-like morphological structures, including a neural tube and segmented somites. Single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) further reveals that these human 'RA-gastruloids' contain more advanced cell types than conventional gastruloids, including neural crest cells, renal progenitor cells, skeletal muscle cells, and, rarely, neural progenitor cells. We apply a new approach to computationally stage human RA-gastruloids relative to somite-resolved mouse embryos, early human embryos and other gastruloid models, and find that the developmental stage of human RA-gastruloids is comparable to that of E9.5 mouse embryos, although some cell types show greater or lesser progression. We chemically perturb WNT and BMP signaling in human RA-gastruloids and find that these signaling pathways regulate somite patterning and neural tube length, respectively, while genetic perturbation of the transcription factors PAX3 and TBX6 markedly compromises the formation of neural crest and somites/renal cells, respectively. Human RA-gastruloids complement other embryonic organoids in serving as a simple, robust and screenable model for decoding early human embryogenesis.\nLocal and global changes in cell density induce reorganisation of 3D packing in a proliferating epithelium.\nAuthors: Barone, V.; Tagua, A.; Andres-San Roman, J. A.; Hamdoun, A.; Garrido-Garcia, J.; Lyons, D.; Escudero, L. M.\nScore: 27.8, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579268\nTissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named \"scutoid\" that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development. Summary statementThe study uses sea star embryogenesis as a model of a proliferating epithelium to highlight how cell division induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.\nA tension-induced morphological transition shapes the avian extra-embryonic territory\nAuthors: Michaut, A.; Chamolly, A.; Villedieu, A.; Corson, F.; Gros, J.\nScore: 22.3, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579502\nThe segregation of the extra-embryonic lineage is one of the earliest events and a key step in amniote development. Whereas the regulation of extra-embryonic cell fate specification has been extensively studied, little is known about the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of this lineage. Here, taking advantage of the amenability of avian embryos to live and quantitative imaging, we investigate the cell- and tissue-scale dynamics of epiboly, the process during which the epiblast expands to engulf the entire yolk. We show that tension arising from the outward migration of the epiblast border on the vitelline membrane stretches extra-embryonic cells, which reversibly transition from a columnar to squamous morphology. The propagation of this tension is strongly attenuated in the embryonic territory, which concomitantly undergoes fluid-like motion, culminating in the formation of the primitive streak. We formulate a simple viscoelastic model in which the tissue responds elastically to isotropic stress but flows in response to shear stress, and show that it recapitulates the flows and deformation of both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Together, our results clarify the mechanical basis of early avian embryogenesis and provide a framework unifying the divergent mechanical behaviors observed in the contiguous embryonic and extra-embryonic territories that make up the epiblast. HighlightsO_LIThe extra-embryonic region expands radially during epiboly C_LIO_LICell area increase accounts for the rapid extra-embryonic expansion C_LIO_LIEpiboly-induced tension reversibly stretches extra-embryonic cells C_LIO_LIA simple viscoelastic model recovers the morphogenesis of the entire epiblast C_LI\nThe Guinea Pig: A New Model for Human Preimplantation Development\nAuthors: Canizo, J. R.; Zhao, C.; Petropoulos, S.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578945\nPreimplantation development is an important window of human embryogenesis. During this time, the initial lineages are formed which largely govern embryo competence, implantation, and ultimately the developmental potential of the fetus. Ethical constraints and limitations surrounding human embryos research often necessitates the use of a model system. We now identify the guinea pig as a promising small animal model, which closely recapitulates early human embryogenesis in terms of the timing of compaction, early-, mid-, and late-blastocyst formation and implantation. We also observe conserved spatio-temporal expression of key lineage markers, roles of both Hippo and MEK-ERK signaling and an incomplete X-Chromosome inactivation. Further, our multi-species analysis highlights the spatio-temporal expression of conserved and divergent genes during preimplantation development. The guinea pig serves as an exciting new model which will enhance developmental and pluripotency research and can be leveraged to better understand the longer term impact of early exposures on offspring outcomes.\nDifferential tissue deformability underlies shape divergence of the embryonic brain and spinal cord under fluid pressure\nAuthors: McLaren, S. B. P.; Xue, S.-L.; Ding, S.; Winkel, A.; Baldwin, O.; Dwarakacherla, S.; Franze, K.; Hannezo, E.; Xiong, F.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575349\nAn expanded brain enables the complex behaviours of vertebrates that promote their adaptation in diverse ecological niches1-3. Initial morphological differences between the brain and spinal cord emerge as the antero-posteriorly patterned neural plate folds to form the neural tube4-7 during embryonic development. Following neural tube closure, a dramatic expansion of the brain diverges its shape from the spinal cord8, setting their distinct morphologies for further development9,10. How the brain and the spinal cord expand differentially remains unclear. Here, using the chicken embryo as a model, we show that the hindbrain expands through dorsal tissue thinning under a positive hydrostatic pressure from the neural tube lumen11,12 while the dorsal spinal cord shape resists the same pressure. Using magnetic droplets and atomic force microscopy, we reveal that the dorsal tissue in the hindbrain is more fluid than in the spinal cord. The dorsal hindbrain harbours more migratory neural crest cells13 and exhibits reduced apical actin and a disorganised laminin matrix compared to the dorsal spinal cord. Blocking the activity of neural crest-associated matrix metalloproteinases inhibited dorsal tissue thinning, leading to abnormal brain morphology. Transplanting early dorsal hindbrain cells to the spinal cord was sufficient to create a region with expanded brain-like morphology including a thinned-out roof. Our findings open new questions in vertebrate head evolution and neural tube defects, and suggest a general role of mechanical pre-pattern in creating shape differences in epithelial tubes.\nA paternal cardiac lesion induces cardiac adaptation in offspring\nAuthors: Coppe, B.; Galardi-Castilla, M.; Sanz-Morejon, A.; Arora, P.; Lucas, J.; Lalaguna, L.; Lara Pezzi, E.; Flores, I.; Mercader, N.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579452\nBackgroundFollowing cardiac injury, whether the heart is permanently damaged or regenerating, distal organs are subjected to changes in physiological function. It remains largely unknown whether a cardiac lesion can affect gametes and transmit heritable changes to subsequent generations. Here, we report the influence of paternal cardiac injury on the following generation. MethodsWe studied the intergenerational influence of neonatal cardiac injury in the mouse, an animal model capable of regenerating the heart after early life injury. Neonatal male mice were subjected to ventricular cryoinjury, crossed at adulthood, and their sires were compared with litters derived from uninjured male mice. We used echocardiography, histology, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize cardiac morphology, composition, function, and response to cardiac insult. ResultsWe show that paternal cardiac injury affects the heart morphology of offspring under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in response to the same injury, the F1 generation derived from injured fathers shows better systemic and cardiac recovery, with non-pathological left ventricular enlargement and improved cardiac function during the regenerative process. This is accompanied by the activation of the immune system healing program at 3 weeks post-injury, together with enhanced transcription of genes associated with physiological hypertrophy. ConclusionsThe memory of a paternal neonatal lesion can be transmitted to offspring and improve their recovery from a cardiac insult.\nProgressive cell fate specification in morphallactic regeneration\nAuthors: Nuninger, C.; Papasaikas, P.; Ferralli, J.; Smallwood, S.; Tsiairis, C. D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579449\nThrough regeneration various species replace lost parts of their body. This is achieved either by growth of new structures at the amputation side (epimorphosis), as is the case of axolotl limb regeneration, or through remodeling of the remaining tissue (morphallaxis), as happens in Hydra. Whereas work on epimorphic regeneration support a gradual proximal to distal establishment of cell identities, morphallactic regeneration is believed to rely on initial establishment of boundary conditions that organize the re-adjustment of the pattern. Performing single cell RNA sequencing during regeneration in Hydra, we revealed the sequence of cells transdifferentiation into the missing identities. We provide evidence that morphallaxis proceeds with progressive specification of cell fates, unifying its mechanism with the one found for epimorphosis.\nA TBX5-dependent compartment boundary patterns the cardiac interventricular septum\nAuthors: Kathiriya, I. S.; Dominguez, M. H.; Rao, K. S.; Muncie-Vasic, J. M.; Devine, W. P.; Hu, K. M.; Hota, S. K.; Garay, B. I.; Quintero, D.; Goyal, P.; Matthews, M. N.; Thomas, R.; Sukonnik, T.; Miguel-Perez, D.; Winchester, S.; Brower, E. F.; Forjaz, A.; Wu, P.-H.; Wirtz, D.; Kiemen, A. L.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578995\nFailure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.\nDeciphering Endothelial and Mesenchymal Organ Specification in Vascularized Lung and Intestinal Organoids\nAuthors: Miao, Y.; Tan, C.; Pek, N.

N.; Helmrath, M. A.; Wells, J. M.; Takebe, T.; Zorn, A. M.; Chen, Y.-W.; Guo, M.; Gu, M.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.577460\nTo investigate the co-development of vasculature, mesenchyme, and epithelium crucial for organogenesis and the acquisition of organ-specific characteristics, we constructed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived organoid system comprising lung or intestinal epithelium surrounded by organotypic mesenchyme and vasculature. We demonstrated the pivotal role of co-differentiating mesoderm and endoderm via precise BMP regulation in generating multilineage organoids and gut tube patterning. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed organ specificity in endothelium and mesenchyme, and uncovered key ligands driving endothelial specification in the lung (e.g., WNT2B and Semaphorins) or intestine (e.g., GDF15). Upon transplantation under the kidney capsule in mice, these organoids further matured and developed perfusable human-specific sub-epithelial capillaries. Additionally, our model recapitulated the abnormal endothelial-epithelial crosstalk in patients with FOXF1 deletion or mutations. Multilineage organoids provide a unique platform to study developmental cues guiding endothelial and mesenchymal cell fate determination, and investigate intricate cell-cell communications in human organogenesis and disease. HighlightsO_LIBMP signaling fine-tunes the co-differentiation of mesoderm and endoderm. C_LIO_LIThe cellular composition in multilineage organoids resembles that of human fetal organs. C_LIO_LIMesenchyme and endothelium co-developed within the organoids adopt organ-specific characteristics. C_LIO_LIMultilineage organoids recapitulate abnormal endothelial-epithelial crosstalk in FOXF1-associated disorders.

K.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2024-02-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.06.579243\nAnteroposterior (AP) elongation of the vertebrate body plan is driven by convergence and extension (C\u0026E) gastrulation movements in both the mesoderm and neuroectoderm, but how or whether molecular regulation of C\u0026E differs between tissues remains an open question. Using a zebrafish explant model of AP axis extension, we show that C\u0026E of the neuroectoderm and mesoderm can be uncoupled ex vivo, and that morphogenesis of individual tissues results from distinct morphogen signaling dynamics. Using precise temporal manipulation of BMP and Nodal signaling, we identify a critical developmental window during which high or low BMP/Nodal ratios induce neuroectoderm- or mesoderm-driven C\u0026E, respectively. Increased BMP activity similarly enhances C\u0026E specifically in the ectoderm of intact zebrafish gastrulae, highlighting the in vivo relevance of our findings. Together, these results demonstrate that temporal dynamics of BMP and Nodal morphogen signaling activate distinct morphogenetic programs governing C\u0026E gastrulation movements within individual tissues. SUMMARY STATEMENTUsing zebrafish embryo and explant models, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics of morphogen signaling ratios distinguish between tissue-specific morphogenetic programs during vertebrate body plan formation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Embryonic organoids are emerging as powerful models for studying early mammalian development. For example, stem cell-derived &#39;gastruloids&#39; form elongating structures containing all three germ layers. However, although elongated, human gastruloids do not morphologically resemble post-implantation embryos. Here we show that a specific, discontinuous regimen of retinoic acid (RA) robustly induces human gastruloids with embryo-like morphological structures, including a neural tube and segmented somites. Single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) further reveals that these human &#39;RA-gastruloids&#39; contain more advanced cell types than conventional gastruloids, including neural crest cells, renal progenitor cells, skeletal muscle cells, and, rarely, neural progenitor cells. We apply a new approach to computationally stage human RA-gastruloids relative to somite-resolved mouse embryos, early human embryos and other gastruloid models, and find that the developmental stage of human RA-gastruloids is comparable to that of E9.5 mouse embryos, although some cell types show greater or lesser progression. We chemically perturb WNT and BMP signaling in human RA-gastruloids and find that these signaling pathways regulate somite patterning and neural tube length, respectively, while genetic perturbation of the transcription factors PAX3 and TBX6 markedly compromises the formation of neural crest and somites/renal cells, respectively. Human RA-gastruloids complement other embryonic organoids in serving as a simple, robust and screenable model for decoding early human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named &#34;scutoid&#34; that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.

Summary statementThe study uses sea star embryogenesis as a model of a proliferating epithelium to highlight how cell division induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The segregation of the extra-embryonic lineage is one of the earliest events and a key step in amniote development. Whereas the regulation of extra-embryonic cell fate specification has been extensively studied, little is known about the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of this lineage. Here, taking advantage of the amenability of avian embryos to live and quantitative imaging, we investigate the cell- and tissue-scale dynamics of epiboly, the process during which the epiblast expands to engulf the entire yolk. We show that tension arising from the outward migration of the epiblast border on the vitelline membrane stretches extra-embryonic cells, which reversibly transition from a columnar to squamous morphology. The propagation of this tension is strongly attenuated in the embryonic territory, which concomitantly undergoes fluid-like motion, culminating in the formation of the primitive streak. We formulate a simple viscoelastic model in which the tissue responds elastically to isotropic stress but flows in response to shear stress, and show that it recapitulates the flows and deformation of both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Together, our results clarify the mechanical basis of early avian embryogenesis and provide a framework unifying the divergent mechanical behaviors observed in the contiguous embryonic and extra-embryonic territories that make up the epiblast.

        <p class="abstract">Preimplantation development is an important window of human embryogenesis. During this time, the initial lineages are formed which largely govern embryo competence, implantation, and ultimately the developmental potential of the fetus. Ethical constraints and limitations surrounding human embryos research often necessitates the use of a model system. We now identify the guinea pig as a promising small animal model, which closely recapitulates early human embryogenesis in terms of the timing of compaction, early-, mid-, and late-blastocyst formation and implantation. We also observe conserved spatio-temporal expression of key lineage markers, roles of both Hippo and MEK-ERK signaling and an incomplete X-Chromosome inactivation. Further, our multi-species analysis highlights the spatio-temporal expression of conserved and divergent genes during preimplantation development. The guinea pig serves as an exciting new model which will enhance developmental and pluripotency research and can be leveraged to better understand the longer term impact of early exposures on offspring outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An expanded brain enables the complex behaviours of vertebrates that promote their adaptation in diverse ecological niches1-3. Initial morphological differences between the brain and spinal cord emerge as the antero-posteriorly patterned neural plate folds to form the neural tube4-7 during embryonic development. Following neural tube closure, a dramatic expansion of the brain diverges its shape from the spinal cord8, setting their distinct morphologies for further development9,10. How the brain and the spinal cord expand differentially remains unclear. Here, using the chicken embryo as a model, we show that the hindbrain expands through dorsal tissue thinning under a positive hydrostatic pressure from the neural tube lumen11,12 while the dorsal spinal cord shape resists the same pressure. Using magnetic droplets and atomic force microscopy, we reveal that the dorsal tissue in the hindbrain is more fluid than in the spinal cord. The dorsal hindbrain harbours more migratory neural crest cells13 and exhibits reduced apical actin and a disorganised laminin matrix compared to the dorsal spinal cord. Blocking the activity of neural crest-associated matrix metalloproteinases inhibited dorsal tissue thinning, leading to abnormal brain morphology. Transplanting early dorsal hindbrain cells to the spinal cord was sufficient to create a region with expanded brain-like morphology including a thinned-out roof. Our findings open new questions in vertebrate head evolution and neural tube defects, and suggest a general role of mechanical pre-pattern in creating shape differences in epithelial tubes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFollowing cardiac injury, whether the heart is permanently damaged or regenerating, distal organs are subjected to changes in physiological function. It remains largely unknown whether a cardiac lesion can affect gametes and transmit heritable changes to subsequent generations. Here, we report the influence of paternal cardiac injury on the following generation.

MethodsWe studied the intergenerational influence of neonatal cardiac injury in the mouse, an animal model capable of regenerating the heart after early life injury. Neonatal male mice were subjected to ventricular cryoinjury, crossed at adulthood, and their sires were compared with litters derived from uninjured male mice. We used echocardiography, histology, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize cardiac morphology, composition, function, and response to cardiac insult.

ResultsWe show that paternal cardiac injury affects the heart morphology of offspring under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in response to the same injury, the F1 generation derived from injured fathers shows better systemic and cardiac recovery, with non-pathological left ventricular enlargement and improved cardiac function during the regenerative process. This is accompanied by the activation of the immune system healing program at 3 weeks post-injury, together with enhanced transcription of genes associated with physiological hypertrophy.

ConclusionsThe memory of a paternal neonatal lesion can be transmitted to offspring and improve their recovery from a cardiac insult.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Through regeneration various species replace lost parts of their body. This is achieved either by growth of new structures at the amputation side (epimorphosis), as is the case of axolotl limb regeneration, or through remodeling of the remaining tissue (morphallaxis), as happens in Hydra. Whereas work on epimorphic regeneration support a gradual proximal to distal establishment of cell identities, morphallactic regeneration is believed to rely on initial establishment of boundary conditions that organize the re-adjustment of the pattern. Performing single cell RNA sequencing during regeneration in Hydra, we revealed the sequence of cells transdifferentiation into the missing identities. We provide evidence that morphallaxis proceeds with progressive specification of cell fates, unifying its mechanism with the one found for epimorphosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Failure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To investigate the co-development of vasculature, mesenchyme, and epithelium crucial for organogenesis and the acquisition of organ-specific characteristics, we constructed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived organoid system comprising lung or intestinal epithelium surrounded by organotypic mesenchyme and vasculature. We demonstrated the pivotal role of co-differentiating mesoderm and endoderm via precise BMP regulation in generating multilineage organoids and gut tube patterning. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed organ specificity in endothelium and mesenchyme, and uncovered key ligands driving endothelial specification in the lung (e.g., WNT2B and Semaphorins) or intestine (e.g., GDF15). Upon transplantation under the kidney capsule in mice, these organoids further matured and developed perfusable human-specific sub-epithelial capillaries. Additionally, our model recapitulated the abnormal endothelial-epithelial crosstalk in patients with FOXF1 deletion or mutations. Multilineage organoids provide a unique platform to study developmental cues guiding endothelial and mesenchymal cell fate determination, and investigate intricate cell-cell communications in human organogenesis and disease.

        <p class="abstract">Anteroposterior (AP) elongation of the vertebrate body plan is driven by convergence and extension (C&amp;E) gastrulation movements in both the mesoderm and neuroectoderm, but how or whether molecular regulation of C&amp;E differs between tissues remains an open question. Using a zebrafish explant model of AP axis extension, we show that C&amp;E of the neuroectoderm and mesoderm can be uncoupled ex vivo, and that morphogenesis of individual tissues results from distinct morphogen signaling dynamics. Using precise temporal manipulation of BMP and Nodal signaling, we identify a critical developmental window during which high or low BMP/Nodal ratios induce neuroectoderm- or mesoderm-driven C&amp;E, respectively. Increased BMP activity similarly enhances C&amp;E specifically in the ectoderm of intact zebrafish gastrulae, highlighting the in vivo relevance of our findings. Together, these results demonstrate that temporal dynamics of BMP and Nodal morphogen signaling activate distinct morphogenetic programs governing C&amp;E gastrulation movements within individual tissues.

SUMMARY STATEMENTUsing zebrafish embryo and explant models, we demonstrate that temporal dynamics of morphogen signaling ratios distinguish between tissue-specific morphogenetic programs during vertebrate body plan formation.</p>
