The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.\nDisrupted endosomal trafficking of the Vangl-Celsr polarity complex causes congenital anomalies in trachea-esophageal separation\nAuthors: Edwards, N. A.; Kashyap, A.; Warren, A.; Agricola, Z.; Kenny, A. P.; Shen, Y.; Chung, W. K.; Zorn, A. M.\nScore: 10.0, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561909\nThe developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.\nCut it out: Out-of-plane stresses in cell sheet folding of Volvox embryos\nAuthors: Haas, P. A.; Hoehn, S. S. M. H.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562736\nThe folding of cellular monolayers pervades embryonic development and disease. It results from stresses out of the plane of the tissue, often caused by cell shape changes including cell wedging via apical constriction. These local cellular changes need not however be compatible with the global shape of the tissue. Such geometric incompatibilities lead to residual stresses that have out-of-plane components in curved tissues, but the mechanics and function of these out-of-plane stresses are poorly understood, perhaps because their quantification has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this difficulty by combining laser ablation experiments and a mechanical model to reveal that such out-of-plane residual stresses exist and also persist during the inversion of the spherical embryos of the green alga Volvox. We show how to quantify the mechanical properties of the curved tissue from its unfurling on ablation, and reproduce the tissue shape sequence at different developmental timepoints quantitatively by our mechanical model. Strikingly, this reveals not only clear mechanical signatures of out-of-plane stresses associated with cell shape changes away from those regions where cell wedging bends the tissue, but also indicates an adaptive response of the tissue to these stresses. Our results thus suggest that cell sheet folding is guided mechanically not only by cell wedging, but also by out-of-plane stresses from these additional cell shape changes.\nTwo distinct waves of transcriptome and translatome remodelling drive germline stem cell differentiation\nAuthors: Samuels, T. J.; Gui, J.; Gebert, D.; Karam Teixeira, F.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.14.540555\nDevelopment and tissue maintenance require a supply of new cells, which are generated by division of stem cells and then specialised to perform their function. The differentiation process requires the tight control of gene expression, but this has been challenging to study in a systematic manner in adult stem cells, which are sparsely distributed in tissues. We have overcome these limitations by establishing a robust protocol to synchronise Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation in vivo, allowing us to perform transcriptome and translatome analyses at high temporal resolution during differentiation. As well as observing dynamic changes in mRNA level, promoter usage and exon inclusion, our data reveal that changing translation efficiency is the predominant regulatory mechanism during GSC differentiation. Indeed, changes in mRNA level are frequently buffered by changes in translation efficiency, including the translational repression of transcripts that will only be translated later during oocyte maturation or embryo development. Contrary to the expected linear accumulation of changes from stem cell to differentiated cell, our data reveal that differentiation occurs through two distinct waves of changes in both the transcriptome and translatome level.\nEmerging cooperativity between Oct4 and Sox2 governs the pluripotency network in mouse embryos\nAuthors: Schöler, H. R.; Hou, Y.; Nie, Z.; Velychko, S.; Bedzhov, I.; Heising, S.; Jiang, Q.; Zhang, H.; Wu, G.; Adachi, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562912\nDuring the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.\nScale-independent topological interactions drive the first fate decision in the Drosophila embryo\nAuthors: Hur, W.; Mukherjee, A.; Hayden, L.; Lu, Z.; Chao, A.; Mitchell, N. P.; Streichan, S. J.; Vergassola, M.; Di Talia, S.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561879\nDuring embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.\nNutritional sex-specificity during larval development in mosquitoes\nAuthors: Romoli, O.; Serrato-Salas, J.; Gapp, C.; Figueras Ivern, P.; Gendrin, M.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562973\nMosquitoes rely on their microbiota for B vitamin provision. We previously found that Aedes aegypti larvae cleared of their microbiota at the beginning of the third instar were impaired in their development and that folic acid supplementation increased the proportion of larvae reaching the adult stage. In this study, we investigated the effects of other B vitamins on the development of germ-free mosquito larvae. We found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex- ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin- treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of B vitamin treated male and female larvae identified few genes that may be involved in specific vitamin-induced mechanisms. The treatment of germ-free larvae with high doses of individual B vitamin solutions identified a specific toxic effect related to biotin exposure at high concentrations. The supplementation of germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses revealed divergent biotin requirements and toxic effects for male and female Ae. aegypti larvae. These findings shed new light on sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds during the development of insect larvae, and on their consequences on the sex ratio of adults.\nMacrophage differentiation requires DNA damage caused by Caspase-Activated DNase\nAuthors: Maurya, D.; Rai, G.; Mandal, D.; Mondal, B. C.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562503\nPhagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to self-renew lifelong. However, the mechanisms for macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Using in vivo genetic analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, we show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling triggers apoptotic signaling and causes DNA breaks during macrophage development. However, the same Akt signaling attenuates Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1) to control apoptotic and JNK activity in differentiating macrophages. DNA-damaged differentiating cells display autophagy activity as a survival strategy. Furthermore, caspase activity is required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. This study reveals a previously unknown relationship between developmental signals and caspase-activated DNA breaks necessary for multifunctional macrophage differentiation.\nPatterned embryonic invagination evolved in response to mechanical instability\nAuthors: Vellutini, B. C.; Cuenca, M. B.; Krishna, A.; Szałapak, A.; Modes, C. D.; Tomancak, P.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534554\nMechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.\nSpatial transcriptomics in adult Drosophila reveals new cell types in the brain and identifies subcellular mRNA patterns in muscles\nAuthors: Janssens, J.; Mangeol, P.; Hecker, N.; Partel, G.; Spanier, K.; Ismail, J. N.; Hulselmans, G. J.; Aerts, S.; Schnorrer, F.\nScore: 68.1, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561233\nRecently, we have achieved a significant milestone with the creation of the Fly Cell Atlas. This single-nuclei atlas encompasses the entire fly, covering the entire head and body, in addition to all major organs. This atlas catalogs hundreds to thousands of cell types, of which we annotated 250. This still leaves many clusters to be fully characterized, in particular in the brain. Furthermore, with single-nuclei sequencing, all information about the spatial location of the cells and of the mRNAs within these cells is lost. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In a proof of concept study, we have applied spatial transcriptomics using a selected gene panel to pinpoint the locations of 150 mRNA species in the adult fly. This enabled us to map unknown cell types identified in the Fly Cell Atlas to their spatial locations in the brain. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics discovered interesting principles of mRNA localization in large crowded muscle cells that may spark future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, we present a set of computational tools that will allow for easier integration of spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Gonadal sex determination in mice is a complex and dynamic process, crucial for the development of functional reproductive organs. The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The folding of cellular monolayers pervades embryonic development and disease. It results from stresses out of the plane of the tissue, often caused by cell shape changes including cell wedging via apical constriction. These local cellular changes need not however be compatible with the global shape of the tissue. Such geometric incompatibilities lead to residual stresses that have out-of-plane components in curved tissues, but the mechanics and function of these out-of-plane stresses are poorly understood, perhaps because their quantification has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this difficulty by combining laser ablation experiments and a mechanical model to reveal that such out-of-plane residual stresses exist and also persist during the inversion of the spherical embryos of the green alga Volvox. We show how to quantify the mechanical properties of the curved tissue from its unfurling on ablation, and reproduce the tissue shape sequence at different developmental timepoints quantitatively by our mechanical model. Strikingly, this reveals not only clear mechanical signatures of out-of-plane stresses associated with cell shape changes away from those regions where cell wedging bends the tissue, but also indicates an adaptive response of the tissue to these stresses. Our results thus suggest that cell sheet folding is guided mechanically not only by cell wedging, but also by out-of-plane stresses from these additional cell shape changes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Development and tissue maintenance require a supply of new cells, which are generated by division of stem cells and then specialised to perform their function. The differentiation process requires the tight control of gene expression, but this has been challenging to study in a systematic manner in adult stem cells, which are sparsely distributed in tissues. We have overcome these limitations by establishing a robust protocol to synchronise Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation in vivo, allowing us to perform transcriptome and translatome analyses at high temporal resolution during differentiation. As well as observing dynamic changes in mRNA level, promoter usage and exon inclusion, our data reveal that changing translation efficiency is the predominant regulatory mechanism during GSC differentiation. Indeed, changes in mRNA level are frequently buffered by changes in translation efficiency, including the translational repression of transcripts that will only be translated later during oocyte maturation or embryo development. Contrary to the expected linear accumulation of changes from stem cell to differentiated cell, our data reveal that differentiation occurs through two distinct waves of changes in both the transcriptome and translatome level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes rely on their microbiota for B vitamin provision. We previously found that Aedes aegypti larvae cleared of their microbiota at the beginning of the third instar were impaired in their development and that folic acid supplementation increased the proportion of larvae reaching the adult stage. In this study, we investigated the effects of other B vitamins on the development of germ-free mosquito larvae. We found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex- ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin- treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of B vitamin treated male and female larvae identified few genes that may be involved in specific vitamin-induced mechanisms. The treatment of germ-free larvae with high doses of individual B vitamin solutions identified a specific toxic effect related to biotin exposure at high concentrations. The supplementation of germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses revealed divergent biotin requirements and toxic effects for male and female Ae. aegypti larvae. These findings shed new light on sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds during the development of insect larvae, and on their consequences on the sex ratio of adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to self-renew lifelong. However, the mechanisms for macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Using in vivo genetic analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, we show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling triggers apoptotic signaling and causes DNA breaks during macrophage development. However, the same Akt signaling attenuates Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1) to control apoptotic and JNK activity in differentiating macrophages. DNA-damaged differentiating cells display autophagy activity as a survival strategy. Furthermore, caspase activity is required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. This study reveals a previously unknown relationship between developmental signals and caspase-activated DNA breaks necessary for multifunctional macrophage differentiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recently, we have achieved a significant milestone with the creation of the Fly Cell Atlas. This single-nuclei atlas encompasses the entire fly, covering the entire head and body, in addition to all major organs. This atlas catalogs hundreds to thousands of cell types, of which we annotated 250. This still leaves many clusters to be fully characterized, in particular in the brain. Furthermore, with single-nuclei sequencing, all information about the spatial location of the cells and of the mRNAs within these cells is lost. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In a proof of concept study, we have applied spatial transcriptomics using a selected gene panel to pinpoint the locations of 150 mRNA species in the adult fly. This enabled us to map unknown cell types identified in the Fly Cell Atlas to their spatial locations in the brain. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics discovered interesting principles of mRNA localization in large crowded muscle cells that may spark future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, we present a set of computational tools that will allow for easier integration of spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets.</p>
