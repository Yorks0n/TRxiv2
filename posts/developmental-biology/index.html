H.\nScore: 1225.2, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.544922\nOur ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.\nDissecting peri-implantation development using cultured human embryos and embryo-like assembloids\nAuthors: Ai, Z.; Niu, B.; Yin, Y.; Xiang, L.; Shi, G.; Duan, K.; Wang, S.; Hu, Y.; Zhang, C.; Zhang, C.; Rong, L.; Kong, R.; Chen, T.; Guo, Y.; Liu, W.; Li, N.; Zhao, S.; Zhu, X.; Mai, X.; Li, Y.; Wu, Z.; Zheng, Y.; Fu, J.; Ji, W.; Li, T.\nScore: 766.0, Published: 2023-06-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545180\nStudies of cultured embryos have provided insights into human peri-implantation development. However, detailed knowledge of peri-implantation lineage developments as well as underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using 3D-cultured human embryos, herein we report a complete cell atlas of the early post-implantation lineages and decipher cellular composition and gene signatures of the epiblast and hypoblast derivatives. In addition, we develop an embryo-like assembloid (E-assembloid) by assembling naive hESCs and extraembryonic cells. Using human embryos and E-assembloids, we reveal that WNT, BMP and Nodal signaling synergistically, but functionally differently, orchestrate human peri-implantation lineage development. Specially, we dissect mechanisms underlying extraembryonic mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm specifications. Finally, an improved E-assembloid is developed to recapitulate the epiblast and hypoblast developments and tissue architectures in the pre-gastrulation human embryo. Our findings provide insights of the human peri-implantation development, and the E-assembloid offers a useful model to disentangle cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that drive human embryogenesis.\nTransgene directed induction of a stem cell-derived human embryo model\nAuthors: Weatherbee, B.

Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.\nModelling Human Post-Implantation Development via Extra-Embryonic Niche Engineering\nAuthors: Hislop, J.

Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons. Additionally, human stem cell models of early post-implantation development with both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue morphogenesis are lacking. Here, we present iDiscoid, produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells via an engineered synthetic gene circuit. iDiscoids exhibit reciprocal co-development of human embryonic tissue and engineered extra-embryonic niche in a model of human post-implantation. They exhibit unanticipated self-organization and tissue boundary formation that recapitulates yolk sac-like tissue specification with extra-embryonic mesoderm and hematopoietic characteristics, the formation of bilaminar disc-like embryonic morphology, the development of an amniotic-like cavity, and acquisition of an anterior-like hypoblast pole and posterior-like axis. iDiscoids offer an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human early post-implantation development. Thus, they have the potential to provide a tractable human model for drug testing, developmental toxicology, and disease modeling.\nPatterning and folding of intestinal villi by active mesenchymal dewetting\nAuthors: Huycke, T. R.; Miyazaki, H.; Häkkinen, T.; Srivastava, V.; Barruet, E.; McGinnis, C. S.; Kalantari, A.; Cornwall-Scoones, J.; Vaka, D.; Zhu, Q.; Jo, H.; DeGrado, W.

J.\nScore: 33.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546328\nTissue folding generates structural motifs critical to organ function. In the intestine, bending of a flat epithelium into a periodic pattern of folds gives rise to villi, the numerous finger-like protrusions that are essential for nutrient absorption. However, the molecular and mechanical mechanisms driving the initiation and morphogenesis of villi remain a matter of debate. Here, we identify an active mechanical mechanism that simultaneously patterns and folds intestinal villi. We find that PDGFRA+ subepithelial mesenchymal cells generate myosin II-dependent forces sufficient to produce patterned curvature in neighboring tissue interfaces. At the cell-level, this occurs through a process dependent upon matrix metalloproteinase-mediated tissue fluidization and altered cell-ECM adhesion. By combining computational models with in vivo experiments, we reveal these cellular features manifest at the tissue-level as differences in interfacial tensions that promote mesenchymal aggregation and interface bending through a process analogous to the active de-wetting of a thin liquid film.\nClonal neural tube organoids self-organise floorplate through BMP-mediated cluster competition\nAuthors: Krammer, T.; Stuart, H. T.; Gromberg, E.; Ishihara, K.; Melchionda, M.; Wang, J.; Costantini, E.; Lehr, S.; Cislo, D.; Arbanas, L.; Hoermann, A.; Neumueller, R. A.; Elvassore, N.; Siggia, E.; Briscoe, J.; Kicheva, A.; Tanaka, E. M.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546258\nOrganoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2+ floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2+ clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable \"winning\" floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2+ clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2+ cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.\nMORPHOGENIC VERSUS MITOGENIC ROLES OF SHH ARE SEGREGATED ON DISTINCT EXOSOMES REGULATED BY CELLULAR RAB7 LEVELS\nAuthors: Walvekar, A.; Pandey, S.; Kamat, S.; Damodar, S.; Ladher, R. K.; Vyas, N.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546648\nThe secreted signaling molecule, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is involved in patterning and growth of various embryonic tissues across species. This lipid-anchored protein is secreted on extracellular vesicles to activate signaling. Shh has two functions during spinal cord development, acting as a morphogen to pattern the ventral neural tube and a mitogen to maintain neural progenitors. Here, we find that these activities are segregated on to two distinct pools of exosomes. Shh secreted on a classical exosomal pool (Shh-P150) is able to activate ventral threshold targets in the neural tube. In contrast, the mitogenic activity, is elicited by a lighter exosomal pool (Shh-P450). We further show that cellular environment plays a major role in regulating the biogenesis of P150 versus P450 by modulating Rab7 levels. We find that active Rab7 is necessary for ventral neural tube patterning through the regulation of Shh-P150 secretion. The cellular mechanisms involved in packaging and secretion of Shh with different partners on P150 or P450 pools may be more general, enabling the separation of functional activities of signaling molecules during development and disease.\nCoordinated wound responses in a regenerative animal-algal photosymbiotic metaorganism\nAuthors: Nanes Sarfati, D.; Xue, Y.; Song, E. S.; Byrne, A.; Le, D.; Darmanis, S.; Quake, S. R.; Burlacot, A.; Sikes, J.; Wang, B.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-06-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545945\nAnimal regeneration requires coordinated responses of many cell types throughout the animal body. In animals carrying endosymbionts, cells from the other species may also participate in regeneration, but how cellular responses are integrated across species is yet to be unraveled. Here, we study the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura, which hosts symbiotic Tetraselmis green algae and can regenerate entire bodies from small tissue fragments. We show that animal injury leads to a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic algae and concurrently induces upregulation of a cohort of photosynthesis-related genes. A deeply conserved animal transcription factor, runt, is induced after injury and required for the acoel regeneration. Knockdown of runt also dampens algal transcriptional responses to the host injury, particularly in photosynthesis related pathways, and results in further reduction of photosynthetic efficiency post-injury. Our results suggest that the runt-dependent animal regeneration program coordinates wound responses across the symbiotic partners and regulates photosynthetic carbon assimilation in this metaorganism.\nRegeneration leads to global tissue rejuvenation in aging sexual planarians\nAuthors: Dai, X.; Li, X.; Pletcher, S.; Paris, D.; Kruglyak, L.; Sobota, J.; Guo, L.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.546358\nAn ability to delay aging--or to reverse the negative effects of aging--could prevent age-related disease and greatly enhance quality of life in old age. However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered \"immortal\" due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.\nscRNA-seq reveals the diversity of the developing cardiac cell lineage and molecular building blocks of the primary pacemaker\nAuthors: Abu Nahia, K.; Sulej, A.; Migdal, M.; Ochocka, N.; Ho, R.; Kaminska, B.; Zagorski, M.; Winata, C.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546508\nThe heart is comprised of a variety of specialized cell types that work in unison to maintain blood flow. Here we utilized scRNA-seq analysis to delineate the diversity of cardiac cell types in the zebrafish. With the growing use of the zebrafish to model human heart biology, a deeper insight into its complex cellular composition is critical for a better understanding of heart function, development, and associated malformations. We present a high resolution atlas of zebrafish heart single cells transcriptomics, consisting of over 50 000 cells representing the building blocks of the zebrafish heart at 48 and 72 hpf. We defined 18 discrete cell populations comprising major cell lineages and sublineages of the developing heart. We pinpointed a population of cells likely to be the primary pacemaker and identified the transcriptome profile defining this critical cell type. Our analyses identified two genes, atp1b3b and colec10, which were enriched in the sinoatrial pacemaker cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of these two genes significantly reduced heart rate which is accompanied by arrhythmia or morphological defects, suggesting their novel function in cardiac development and conduction. Additionally, we describe other subpopulations of cardiac cell lineages, including the endothelial and neural cells, whose expression profiles we provide as a resource for further investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this organ.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Our ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies of cultured embryos have provided insights into human peri-implantation development. However, detailed knowledge of peri-implantation lineage developments as well as underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using 3D-cultured human embryos, herein we report a complete cell atlas of the early post-implantation lineages and decipher cellular composition and gene signatures of the epiblast and hypoblast derivatives. In addition, we develop an embryo-like assembloid (E-assembloid) by assembling naive hESCs and extraembryonic cells. Using human embryos and E-assembloids, we reveal that WNT, BMP and Nodal signaling synergistically, but functionally differently, orchestrate human peri-implantation lineage development. Specially, we dissect mechanisms underlying extraembryonic mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm specifications. Finally, an improved E-assembloid is developed to recapitulate the epiblast and hypoblast developments and tissue architectures in the pre-gastrulation human embryo. Our findings provide insights of the human peri-implantation development, and the E-assembloid offers a useful model to disentangle cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that drive human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus, yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryo in vivo. Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Implantation of the human embryo commences a critical developmental stage that comprises profound morphogenetic alteration of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, axis formation, and gastrulation events. Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons. Additionally, human stem cell models of early post-implantation development with both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue morphogenesis are lacking. Here, we present iDiscoid, produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells via an engineered synthetic gene circuit. iDiscoids exhibit reciprocal co-development of human embryonic tissue and engineered extra-embryonic niche in a model of human post-implantation. They exhibit unanticipated self-organization and tissue boundary formation that recapitulates yolk sac-like tissue specification with extra-embryonic mesoderm and hematopoietic characteristics, the formation of bilaminar disc-like embryonic morphology, the development of an amniotic-like cavity, and acquisition of an anterior-like hypoblast pole and posterior-like axis. iDiscoids offer an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human early post-implantation development. Thus, they have the potential to provide a tractable human model for drug testing, developmental toxicology, and disease modeling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue folding generates structural motifs critical to organ function. In the intestine, bending of a flat epithelium into a periodic pattern of folds gives rise to villi, the numerous finger-like protrusions that are essential for nutrient absorption. However, the molecular and mechanical mechanisms driving the initiation and morphogenesis of villi remain a matter of debate. Here, we identify an active mechanical mechanism that simultaneously patterns and folds intestinal villi. We find that PDGFRA&#43; subepithelial mesenchymal cells generate myosin II-dependent forces sufficient to produce patterned curvature in neighboring tissue interfaces. At the cell-level, this occurs through a process dependent upon matrix metalloproteinase-mediated tissue fluidization and altered cell-ECM adhesion. By combining computational models with in vivo experiments, we reveal these cellular features manifest at the tissue-level as differences in interfacial tensions that promote mesenchymal aggregation and interface bending through a process analogous to the active de-wetting of a thin liquid film.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2&#43; floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2&#43; clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable &#34;winning&#34; floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2&#43; clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2&#43; cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The secreted signaling molecule, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is involved in patterning and growth of various embryonic tissues across species. This lipid-anchored protein is secreted on extracellular vesicles to activate signaling. Shh has two functions during spinal cord development, acting as a morphogen to pattern the ventral neural tube and a mitogen to maintain neural progenitors. Here, we find that these activities are segregated on to two distinct pools of exosomes. Shh secreted on a classical exosomal pool (Shh-P150) is able to activate ventral threshold targets in the neural tube. In contrast, the mitogenic activity, is elicited by a lighter exosomal pool (Shh-P450). We further show that cellular environment plays a major role in regulating the biogenesis of P150 versus P450 by modulating Rab7 levels. We find that active Rab7 is necessary for ventral neural tube patterning through the regulation of Shh-P150 secretion. The cellular mechanisms involved in packaging and secretion of Shh with different partners on P150 or P450 pools may be more general, enabling the separation of functional activities of signaling molecules during development and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal regeneration requires coordinated responses of many cell types throughout the animal body. In animals carrying endosymbionts, cells from the other species may also participate in regeneration, but how cellular responses are integrated across species is yet to be unraveled. Here, we study the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura, which hosts symbiotic Tetraselmis green algae and can regenerate entire bodies from small tissue fragments. We show that animal injury leads to a decline in the photosynthetic efficiency of the symbiotic algae and concurrently induces upregulation of a cohort of photosynthesis-related genes. A deeply conserved animal transcription factor, runt, is induced after injury and required for the acoel regeneration. Knockdown of runt also dampens algal transcriptional responses to the host injury, particularly in photosynthesis related pathways, and results in further reduction of photosynthetic efficiency post-injury. Our results suggest that the runt-dependent animal regeneration program coordinates wound responses across the symbiotic partners and regulates photosynthetic carbon assimilation in this metaorganism.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An ability to delay aging--or to reverse the negative effects of aging--could prevent age-related disease and greatly enhance quality of life in old age. However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered &#34;immortal&#34; due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The heart is comprised of a variety of specialized cell types that work in unison to maintain blood flow. Here we utilized scRNA-seq analysis to delineate the diversity of cardiac cell types in the zebrafish. With the growing use of the zebrafish to model human heart biology, a deeper insight into its complex cellular composition is critical for a better understanding of heart function, development, and associated malformations. We present a high resolution atlas of zebrafish heart single cells transcriptomics, consisting of over 50 000 cells representing the building blocks of the zebrafish heart at 48 and 72 hpf. We defined 18 discrete cell populations comprising major cell lineages and sublineages of the developing heart. We pinpointed a population of cells likely to be the primary pacemaker and identified the transcriptome profile defining this critical cell type. Our analyses identified two genes, atp1b3b and colec10, which were enriched in the sinoatrial pacemaker cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of these two genes significantly reduced heart rate which is accompanied by arrhythmia or morphological defects, suggesting their novel function in cardiac development and conduction. Additionally, we describe other subpopulations of cardiac cell lineages, including the endothelial and neural cells, whose expression profiles we provide as a resource for further investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this organ.</p>
