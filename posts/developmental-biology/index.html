D.; Strnad, P.; Liberali, P.\nScore: 42.4, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559925\nMulticellular systems grow over the course of weeks from single cells to tissues or even full organisms composed of several thousands of cells, making live imaging of such samples challenging. To bridge these wide spatiotemporal scales, we present an open top dual view and dual illumination light sheet microscope dedicated for live imaging of large specimens at single cell resolution. The novel configuration of objectives together with a flexible and customizable multi-well mounting system combines dual view with high throughput multi-position imaging. We use the newly developed microscope to image a wide variety of samples and highlight its capabilities to gain quantitative single-cell information in large specimens such as mature intestinal organoids and gastruloids.\nEndolysosomal dysfunction in radial glia progenitor cells leads to defective cerebral angiogenesis and compromised Blood-Brain Barrier integrity\nAuthors: Bassi, I.; Grunspan, M.; Hen, G.; Ravichandran, K. A.; Moshe, N.; Safriel, S. R.; Chen, A.; Ruiz De Almodovar, C.; Yaniv, K.\nScore: 23.3, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559123\nThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination. Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited. Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes. Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.\nThe Chordate Origins of Heart Regeneration\nAuthors: Schuster, K. J.; Christiaen, L.\nScore: 17.7, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558507\nThe human heart is infamous for not healing after infarction in adults, prompting biomedical interest in species that can regenerate damaged hearts. In such animals as zebrafish and neonatal mice, cardiac repair relies on remaining heart tissue supporting cardiomyocyte proliferation. Natural de novo cardiogenesis in post-embryonic stages thus remains elusive. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona, an ascidian among the closest living relatives to the vertebrates, can survive complete chemogenetic ablation of the heart and loss of cardiac function, and recover both cardiac tissue and contractility. As in vertebrates, Ciona heart regeneration relies on Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling-dependent proliferation of cardiomyocytes, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of regenerative cardiogenesis in chordates. Remarkably, prospective lineage tracing by photoconversion of the fluorescent protein Kaede suggested that new cardiomyocytes can emerge from endodermal lineages in post-metamorphic animals, providing an unprecedented case of regenerative de novo cardiogenesis. Finally, while embryos cannot compensate for early losses of the cardiogenic lineage, forming heartless juveniles, developing animals gain their regenerative ability during metamorphosis, uncovering a fundamental transition between deterministic embryogenesis and regulative post-embryonic development.\nARID3A coordinates the proliferation-differentiation switch of transit-amplifying cells in the intestine\nAuthors: Angelis, N.; Baulies, A.; Kucharska, A.; Kelly, G.; Sopena, M.; Boeing, S.; Li, V. S. W.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559311\nIntestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the crypt base divide and give rise to progenitor cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into various mature epithelial cell types in the transit-amplifying (TA) zone. Here, we identified the transcription factor ARID3A as a novel regulator of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation at the TA compartment. We show that ARID3A forms an expression gradient from villus tip to the early progenitors at the crypts mediated by TGF-{beta} and WNT signalling. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Arid3a reduces proliferation of TA cells. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis shows increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced secretory cells in the Arid3a cKO intestine. Interestingly, upper-villus gene signatures of both enterocytes and secretory cells are enriched in the mutant intestine. We find that the enhanced enterocyte differentiation in the Arid3a cKO intestine is caused by increased binding of HNF1 and HNF4. Finally, we show that loss of Arid3a impairs irradiation-induced regenerative process by altering the dynamics of proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings imply that ARID3A may play a gatekeeping role in the TA compartment to maintain the \"just-right\" proliferation-to-differentiation ratio for tissue homeostasis and plasticity.\nSingle-cell transcription mapping of murine and human mammary organoids responses to female hormones\nAuthors: Ruiz-Ortiz, J.; Lewis, S. M.; Ciccone, M. F.; Chatterjee, D.; Henry, S.; Siepel, A.; Dos Santos, C. O.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559971\nDuring female adolescence and pregnancy, rising levels of hormones result in a cyclic source of signals that control the development of mammary tissue. While such alterations are well understood from a whole-gland perspective, the alterations that such hormones bring to organoid cultures derived from mammary glands have yet to be fully mapped. This is of special importance given that organoids are considered suitable systems to understand cross species breast development. Here we utilized single-cell transcriptional profiling to delineate responses of murine and human normal breast organoid systems to female hormones across evolutionary distinct species. Collectively, our study represents a molecular atlas of epithelial dynamics in response to estrogen and pregnancy hormones.\nBMP signaling pathway member expression is enriched in enteric neural progenitors and required for zebrafish enteric nervous system development\nAuthors: Moore, J. A.; Noah, A. S.; Singleton, E. W.; Uribe, R. A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559191\nThe vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.\nHand2 represses non-cardiac cell fates through chromatin remodeling at cis-regulatory elements\nAuthors: Komatsu, V.; Cooper, B. H.; Yim, P.; Chan, K.; Gong, W.; Wheatley, L.; Rohs, R.; Fraser, S. E.; Trinh, L. A.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.23.559156\nDevelopmental studies have revealed the importance of the transcription factor Hand2 in cardiac development. Hand2 promotes cardiac progenitor differentiation and epithelial maturation, while repressing other tissue types. The mechanisms underlying the promotion of cardiac fates are far better understood than those underlying the repression of alternative fates. Here, we assess Hand2-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac progenitors of zebrafish embryos. Cell-type specific transcriptome analysis shows a dual function for Hand2 in activation of cardiac differentiation genes and repression of pronephric pathways. We identify functional cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility are increased in hand2 mutant cells. These regulatory elements associate with non-cardiac gene expression, and drive reporter gene expression in tissues associated with Hand2-repressed genes. We find that functional Hand2 is sufficient to reduce non-cardiac reporter expression in cardiac lineages. Taken together, our data support a model of Hand2-dependent coordination of transcriptional programs, not only through transcriptional activation of cardiac and epithelial maturation genes, but also through repressive chromatin remodeling at the DNA regulatory elements of non-cardiac genes.\nGut microbiota promotes enteroendocrine cell maturation and mitochondrial function\nAuthors: Alsudayri, A.; Perelman, S.; Chura, A.; Brewer, M.; McDevitt, M.; Drerup, C.; Ye, L.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.558332\nThe enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the intestine are crucial in sensing ingested nutrients and regulating feeding behavior. How gut microbiota regulates the nutrient-sensing EEC activity is unclear. Our transcriptomic analysis of the EECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (CV) zebrafish revealed that commensal microbiota colonization significantly increased the expression of many genes that are associated with mitochondrial function. Using the in vivo imaging approach and 3D automated cell tracking, we developed new methods to image and analyze the EEC cytoplasm and mitochondrial calcium activity at cellular resolution in live zebrafish. Our data revealed that during the development, shortly after gut microbiota colonization, EECs briefly increase cytoplasm and mitochondrial Ca2+, a phenomenon we named EEC awakening. Following the EEC awakening, EEC cytoplasm Ca2+ but not mitochondrial Ca2+ decreased, resulting in a consistent increase in the mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2+ ratio, which is associated with the EEC maturation process. We further discovered that in the immature EECs, mitochondria are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. When EECs mature, mitochondria are highly localized in the basal lateral membrane where EEC vesicle secretion happens. Furthermore, CV EECs but not GF EECs exhibit spontaneous low-amplitude calcium fluctuation. The mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2+ ratio is significantly higher in CV EECs. When stimulating the CV zebrafish with nutrients such as fatty acid, the fatty acid-responsive EECs increase both cytoplasm and mitochondrial calcium. Strikingly, in GF zebrafish, even though nutrient stimulation increases cytoplasm Ca2+, nutrient stimulation-induced EEC mitochondrial Ca2+ increase is nearly abolished. Together, our study reveals that commensal microbiota is critical in supporting EEC mitochondrial function and maturation. Selectively manipulating gut microbial signals to alter EEC mitochondrial function will provide new opportunities to change gut-brain nutrient sensing efficiency and feeding behavior.\nSensitivity of the timing of Drosophila pupal wing morphogenesis to external perturbations\nAuthors: Piscitello-Gomez, R.; Mahmoud, A.; Dye, N. A.; Eaton, S.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558969\nThe morphogenesis of the pupal wing of Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model for understanding the physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis. During this process, the wing undergoes a dramatic reshaping where the hinge region contracts and pulls on the blade region, triggering a dynamic pattern of cell elongation changes, cell divisions, and cell neighborhood changes Etournay et al. (2015). Over our several year study of this process, we noticed that sometime after the year 2016, the onset of morphogenesis became consistently delayed by [~]6 h compared to previous years. Thus, the peak of cell elongation was now observed at 28 hours after puparium formation (hAPF) rather than at 20-22 hAPF. We show here that this delay is independent of genetic background and that the speed of the overall process is relatively unchanged, implying that an environmental factor causes a shift in the onset of the process relative to the start of pupariation. We then investigated how various environmental factors influence the timing of pupal wing morphogenesis, using the dynamics of cell elongation as a proxy. We find that imaging conditions, temperature, diet, Wolbachia infection, and the light/dark cycle have relatively little effect. Preliminary data show that the spectra of light used to rear the flies affects cell elongation dynamics, although the delay was not completely reverted and more experiments are needed to know precisely how this variable affects morphogenesis. In sum, our work suggests the presence of a gate controlling the onset of pupal wing morphogenesis that is influenced by a specific, yet unclear, environmental factor. Once the gate is released, pupal wing morphogenesis occurs at a fairly constant rate, remarkably robust to many environmental variables.\nFAM210B is dispensable for erythroid differentiation in adult mice\nAuthors: Perfetto, M.; Rondelli, C. M.; Gillis, S.; Stratman, A. N.; Yien, Y. Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559581\nIron plays a central role in cellular redox processes, but its ability to adopt multiple oxidation states also enables it to catalyze deleterious reactions. The requirement for iron in erythropoiesis has necessitated the evolution of mechanisms with which to handle the iron required for hemoglobinization. FAM210B was identified as a regulator of mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis in erythroid cell culture and zebrafish models. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that while FAM210B is required for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis under standard cell culture conditions, holotransferrin supplementation was sufficient to chemically complement the iron-deficient phenotype. As the biology of FAM210B is complex and context specific, and whole-organism studies on FAM210 proteins have been limited, we sought to unravel the role of FAM210B in erythropoiesis using knockout mice. We were surprised to discover that Fam210b-/- mice were viable and the adults did not have erythropoietic defects in the bone marrow. In contrast to studies in C. elegans, Fam210b-/- mice were also fertile. There were some modest phenotypes, such as a slight increase in lymphocytes and white cell count in Fam210b-/- females, as well as an increase in body weight in Fam210b-/- males. However, our findings suggest that FAM210B may play a more important role in cellular iron homeostasis under iron deficient conditions. Here, we will discuss the cell culture conditions used in iron metabolism studies that can account for the disparate finding on FAM210B function. Moving forward, resolving these discrepancies will be important in identifying novel iron homeostasis genes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multicellular systems grow over the course of weeks from single cells to tissues or even full organisms composed of several thousands of cells, making live imaging of such samples challenging. To bridge these wide spatiotemporal scales, we present an open top dual view and dual illumination light sheet microscope dedicated for live imaging of large specimens at single cell resolution. The novel configuration of objectives together with a flexible and customizable multi-well mounting system combines dual view with high throughput multi-position imaging. We use the newly developed microscope to image a wide variety of samples and highlight its capabilities to gain quantitative single-cell information in large specimens such as mature intestinal organoids and gastruloids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination.

Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited.

Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes.

Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human heart is infamous for not healing after infarction in adults, prompting biomedical interest in species that can regenerate damaged hearts. In such animals as zebrafish and neonatal mice, cardiac repair relies on remaining heart tissue supporting cardiomyocyte proliferation. Natural de novo cardiogenesis in post-embryonic stages thus remains elusive. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona, an ascidian among the closest living relatives to the vertebrates, can survive complete chemogenetic ablation of the heart and loss of cardiac function, and recover both cardiac tissue and contractility. As in vertebrates, Ciona heart regeneration relies on Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling-dependent proliferation of cardiomyocytes, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of regenerative cardiogenesis in chordates. Remarkably, prospective lineage tracing by photoconversion of the fluorescent protein Kaede suggested that new cardiomyocytes can emerge from endodermal lineages in post-metamorphic animals, providing an unprecedented case of regenerative de novo cardiogenesis. Finally, while embryos cannot compensate for early losses of the cardiogenic lineage, forming heartless juveniles, developing animals gain their regenerative ability during metamorphosis, uncovering a fundamental transition between deterministic embryogenesis and regulative post-embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the crypt base divide and give rise to progenitor cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into various mature epithelial cell types in the transit-amplifying (TA) zone. Here, we identified the transcription factor ARID3A as a novel regulator of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation at the TA compartment. We show that ARID3A forms an expression gradient from villus tip to the early progenitors at the crypts mediated by TGF-{beta} and WNT signalling. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Arid3a reduces proliferation of TA cells. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis shows increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced secretory cells in the Arid3a cKO intestine. Interestingly, upper-villus gene signatures of both enterocytes and secretory cells are enriched in the mutant intestine. We find that the enhanced enterocyte differentiation in the Arid3a cKO intestine is caused by increased binding of HNF1 and HNF4. Finally, we show that loss of Arid3a impairs irradiation-induced regenerative process by altering the dynamics of proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings imply that ARID3A may play a gatekeeping role in the TA compartment to maintain the &#34;just-right&#34; proliferation-to-differentiation ratio for tissue homeostasis and plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During female adolescence and pregnancy, rising levels of hormones result in a cyclic source of signals that control the development of mammary tissue. While such alterations are well understood from a whole-gland perspective, the alterations that such hormones bring to organoid cultures derived from mammary glands have yet to be fully mapped. This is of special importance given that organoids are considered suitable systems to understand cross species breast development. Here we utilized single-cell transcriptional profiling to delineate responses of murine and human normal breast organoid systems to female hormones across evolutionary distinct species. Collectively, our study represents a molecular atlas of epithelial dynamics in response to estrogen and pregnancy hormones.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developmental studies have revealed the importance of the transcription factor Hand2 in cardiac development. Hand2 promotes cardiac progenitor differentiation and epithelial maturation, while repressing other tissue types. The mechanisms underlying the promotion of cardiac fates are far better understood than those underlying the repression of alternative fates. Here, we assess Hand2-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac progenitors of zebrafish embryos. Cell-type specific transcriptome analysis shows a dual function for Hand2 in activation of cardiac differentiation genes and repression of pronephric pathways. We identify functional cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility are increased in hand2 mutant cells. These regulatory elements associate with non-cardiac gene expression, and drive reporter gene expression in tissues associated with Hand2-repressed genes. We find that functional Hand2 is sufficient to reduce non-cardiac reporter expression in cardiac lineages. Taken together, our data support a model of Hand2-dependent coordination of transcriptional programs, not only through transcriptional activation of cardiac and epithelial maturation genes, but also through repressive chromatin remodeling at the DNA regulatory elements of non-cardiac genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the intestine are crucial in sensing ingested nutrients and regulating feeding behavior. How gut microbiota regulates the nutrient-sensing EEC activity is unclear. Our transcriptomic analysis of the EECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (CV) zebrafish revealed that commensal microbiota colonization significantly increased the expression of many genes that are associated with mitochondrial function. Using the in vivo imaging approach and 3D automated cell tracking, we developed new methods to image and analyze the EEC cytoplasm and mitochondrial calcium activity at cellular resolution in live zebrafish. Our data revealed that during the development, shortly after gut microbiota colonization, EECs briefly increase cytoplasm and mitochondrial Ca2&#43;, a phenomenon we named EEC awakening. Following the EEC awakening, EEC cytoplasm Ca2&#43; but not mitochondrial Ca2&#43; decreased, resulting in a consistent increase in the mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2&#43; ratio, which is associated with the EEC maturation process. We further discovered that in the immature EECs, mitochondria are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. When EECs mature, mitochondria are highly localized in the basal lateral membrane where EEC vesicle secretion happens. Furthermore, CV EECs but not GF EECs exhibit spontaneous low-amplitude calcium fluctuation. The mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2&#43; ratio is significantly higher in CV EECs. When stimulating the CV zebrafish with nutrients such as fatty acid, the fatty acid-responsive EECs increase both cytoplasm and mitochondrial calcium. Strikingly, in GF zebrafish, even though nutrient stimulation increases cytoplasm Ca2&#43;, nutrient stimulation-induced EEC mitochondrial Ca2&#43; increase is nearly abolished. Together, our study reveals that commensal microbiota is critical in supporting EEC mitochondrial function and maturation. Selectively manipulating gut microbial signals to alter EEC mitochondrial function will provide new opportunities to change gut-brain nutrient sensing efficiency and feeding behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The morphogenesis of the pupal wing of Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model for understanding the physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis. During this process, the wing undergoes a dramatic reshaping where the hinge region contracts and pulls on the blade region, triggering a dynamic pattern of cell elongation changes, cell divisions, and cell neighborhood changes Etournay et al. (2015). Over our several year study of this process, we noticed that sometime after the year 2016, the onset of morphogenesis became consistently delayed by [~]6 h compared to previous years. Thus, the peak of cell elongation was now observed at 28 hours after puparium formation (hAPF) rather than at 20-22 hAPF. We show here that this delay is independent of genetic background and that the speed of the overall process is relatively unchanged, implying that an environmental factor causes a shift in the onset of the process relative to the start of pupariation. We then investigated how various environmental factors influence the timing of pupal wing morphogenesis, using the dynamics of cell elongation as a proxy. We find that imaging conditions, temperature, diet, Wolbachia infection, and the light/dark cycle have relatively little effect. Preliminary data show that the spectra of light used to rear the flies affects cell elongation dynamics, although the delay was not completely reverted and more experiments are needed to know precisely how this variable affects morphogenesis. In sum, our work suggests the presence of a gate controlling the onset of pupal wing morphogenesis that is influenced by a specific, yet unclear, environmental factor. Once the gate is released, pupal wing morphogenesis occurs at a fairly constant rate, remarkably robust to many environmental variables.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Iron plays a central role in cellular redox processes, but its ability to adopt multiple oxidation states also enables it to catalyze deleterious reactions. The requirement for iron in erythropoiesis has necessitated the evolution of mechanisms with which to handle the iron required for hemoglobinization. FAM210B was identified as a regulator of mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis in erythroid cell culture and zebrafish models. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that while FAM210B is required for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis under standard cell culture conditions, holotransferrin supplementation was sufficient to chemically complement the iron-deficient phenotype. As the biology of FAM210B is complex and context specific, and whole-organism studies on FAM210 proteins have been limited, we sought to unravel the role of FAM210B in erythropoiesis using knockout mice. We were surprised to discover that Fam210b-/- mice were viable and the adults did not have erythropoietic defects in the bone marrow. In contrast to studies in C. elegans, Fam210b-/- mice were also fertile. There were some modest phenotypes, such as a slight increase in lymphocytes and white cell count in Fam210b-/- females, as well as an increase in body weight in Fam210b-/- males. However, our findings suggest that FAM210B may play a more important role in cellular iron homeostasis under iron deficient conditions. Here, we will discuss the cell culture conditions used in iron metabolism studies that can account for the disparate finding on FAM210B function. Moving forward, resolving these discrepancies will be important in identifying novel iron homeostasis genes.</p>
