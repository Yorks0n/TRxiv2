E.; Ikawa, M.; Pauli, A.\nScore: 45.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550750\nFertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.\nGlobal decoupling of cell differentiation from cell division in early embryo development\nAuthors: Kukreja, K.; Patel, N.; Megason, S. G.; Klein, A. M.\nScore: 41.1, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551123\nAs tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.\nGrowth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle\nAuthors: Yadav, A. S.; Hong, L.; Klees, P. M.; Kiss, A.; He, X.; Barrios, I. M.; Heeney, M.; Galang, A. M. D.; Smith, R. S.; Boudaoud, A.; Roeder, A. H. K.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.549953\nFrom smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes. One-Sentence SummaryThe keys to unlocking sepal smoothness are unidirectional growth and even stiffness; misplace them, its time to buckle up!\nMacrophages heterogeneity and significance during human fetal pancreatic development\nAuthors: Migliorini, A.; Ge, S.; Atkins, M. H.; Sambathkumar, R.; Sing, A.; Chua, C.; Gehring, A. J.; Keller, G. M.; Notta, F.; Nostro, M. C.\nScore: 28.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.549142\nOrganogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW)1,2, but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.\nDevelopment of a hepatic cryoinjury model to study liver regeneration\nAuthors: Sande-Melon, M.; Bergemann, D.; Gonzalez-Rosa, J. M.; Cox, A. G.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550437\nThe liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

Y.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550806\nHaematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2 (Hif1/2), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.\nBMP-dependent patterning of ectoderm tissue material properties modulates lateral mesendoderm cell migration during early zebrafish gastrulation\nAuthors: Tavano, S.; Brueckner, D. B.; Tasciyan, S.; Tong, X.; Kardos, R.; Schauer, A.; Hauschild, R.; Heisenberg, C.-P.\nScore: 34.2, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550024\nCell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.\nHeterogeneity and Functional Analysis of Cardiac Fibroblasts in Heart Development\nAuthors: Deng, Y.; He, Y.; Xu, J.; He, H.; Li, G.\nScore: 11.3, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551164\nAbstract: Background As one of the major cell types in the heart, fibroblasts play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Cardiac fibroblasts are known to develop from multiple sources, but their transcriptional profiles have not been systematically compared. Furthermore, while the function of a few genes in cardiac fibroblasts has been studied, the overall function of fibroblasts as a cell type remains uninvestigated. Methods Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze the genome-wide genes expression and extracellular matrix genes expression in fibroblasts, as well as the ligand-receptor interactions between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Single molecular in situ hybridization was employed to analyze the expression pattern of fibroblast subpopulation-specific genes. The Diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system was utilized to ablate fibroblasts at each developmental phase. Results Using RNA staining of Col1a1 at different stages, we grouped cardiac fibroblasts into four developmental phases. Through the analysis of scRNA-seq profiles of fibroblasts at 18 stages from two mouse strains, we identified significant heterogeneity, preserving lineage gene expression in their precursor cells. Within the main fibroblast population, we found differential expressions of Wt1, Tbx18, and Aldh1a2 genes in various cell clusters. Lineage tracing studies showed Wt1- and Tbx18-positive fibroblasts originated from respective epicardial cells. Furthermore, using a conditional DTA system-based elimination, we identified the crucial role of fibroblasts in early embryonic and heart growth, but not in neonatal heart growth. Additionally, we identified the zone- and stage-associated expression of extracellular matrix genes and fibroblast-cardiomyocyte ligand-receptor interactions. This comprehensive understanding sheds light on fibroblast function in heart development. Conclusion We observed cardiac fibroblast heterogeneity at embryonic and neonatal stages, with preserved lineage gene expression. Ablation studies revealed their distinct roles during development, likely influenced by varying extracellular matrix genes and ligand-receptor interactions at different stages.\nOrb2 enables rare-codon-enriched mRNA expression during Drosophila neuron differentiation\nAuthors: Stewart, R. K.; Nguyen, P.; Laederach, A.; Volkan, P. C.; Sawyer, J. K.; Fox, D. T.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550700\nRegulation of codon optimality is an increasingly appreciated layer of cell- and tissue-specific protein expression control. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to show that differentiation of Drosophila neural stem cells into neurons enables protein expression from rare-codon-enriched genes. From a candidate screen, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein Orb2 as a positive regulator of rare-codon-dependent expression in neurons. Using RNA sequencing, we reveal that Orb2-upregulated mRNAs in the brain with abundant Orb2 binding sites have a rare-codon bias. From these Orb2-regulated mRNAs, we demonstrate that rare-codon enrichment is important for expression control and social behavior function of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which neural stem cell differentiation shifts genetic code regulation to enable critical mRNA and protein expression.\nERK signalling orchestrates metachronous transition from naive to formative pluripotency\nAuthors: Mulas, C.; Stammers, M.; Salomaa, S. I.; Heinzen, C.; Suter, D. M.; Smith, A.; Chalut, K. J.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549835\nNaive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe keys to unlocking sepal smoothness are unidirectional growth and even stiffness; misplace them, its time to buckle up!</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW)1,2, but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

        <p class="abstract">Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2 (Hif1/2), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Abstract: Background As one of the major cell types in the heart, fibroblasts play critical roles in multiple biological processes. Cardiac fibroblasts are known to develop from multiple sources, but their transcriptional profiles have not been systematically compared. Furthermore, while the function of a few genes in cardiac fibroblasts has been studied, the overall function of fibroblasts as a cell type remains uninvestigated. Methods Single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze the genome-wide genes expression and extracellular matrix genes expression in fibroblasts, as well as the ligand-receptor interactions between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Single molecular in situ hybridization was employed to analyze the expression pattern of fibroblast subpopulation-specific genes. The Diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system was utilized to ablate fibroblasts at each developmental phase. Results Using RNA staining of Col1a1 at different stages, we grouped cardiac fibroblasts into four developmental phases. Through the analysis of scRNA-seq profiles of fibroblasts at 18 stages from two mouse strains, we identified significant heterogeneity, preserving lineage gene expression in their precursor cells. Within the main fibroblast population, we found differential expressions of Wt1, Tbx18, and Aldh1a2 genes in various cell clusters. Lineage tracing studies showed Wt1- and Tbx18-positive fibroblasts originated from respective epicardial cells. Furthermore, using a conditional DTA system-based elimination, we identified the crucial role of fibroblasts in early embryonic and heart growth, but not in neonatal heart growth. Additionally, we identified the zone- and stage-associated expression of extracellular matrix genes and fibroblast-cardiomyocyte ligand-receptor interactions. This comprehensive understanding sheds light on fibroblast function in heart development. Conclusion We observed cardiac fibroblast heterogeneity at embryonic and neonatal stages, with preserved lineage gene expression. Ablation studies revealed their distinct roles during development, likely influenced by varying extracellular matrix genes and ligand-receptor interactions at different stages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulation of codon optimality is an increasingly appreciated layer of cell- and tissue-specific protein expression control. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to show that differentiation of Drosophila neural stem cells into neurons enables protein expression from rare-codon-enriched genes. From a candidate screen, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein Orb2 as a positive regulator of rare-codon-dependent expression in neurons. Using RNA sequencing, we reveal that Orb2-upregulated mRNAs in the brain with abundant Orb2 binding sites have a rare-codon bias. From these Orb2-regulated mRNAs, we demonstrate that rare-codon enrichment is important for expression control and social behavior function of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which neural stem cell differentiation shifts genetic code regulation to enable critical mRNA and protein expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Naive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.</p>
