D.; Strnad, P.; Liberali, P.\nScore: 83.4, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559925\nMulticellular systems grow over the course of weeks from single cells to tissues or even full organisms composed of several thousands of cells, making live imaging of such samples challenging. To bridge these wide spatiotemporal scales, we present an open top dual view and dual illumination light sheet microscope dedicated for live imaging of large specimens at single cell resolution. The novel configuration of objectives together with a flexible and customizable multi-well mounting system combines dual view with high throughput multi-position imaging. We use the newly developed microscope to image a wide variety of samples and highlight its capabilities to gain quantitative single-cell information in large specimens such as mature intestinal organoids and gastruloids.\nEndolysosomal dysfunction in radial glia progenitor cells leads to defective cerebral angiogenesis and compromised Blood-Brain Barrier integrity\nAuthors: Bassi, I.; Grunspan, M.; Hen, G.; Ravichandran, K. A.; Moshe, N.; Safriel, S. R.; Chen, A.; Ruiz De Almodovar, C.; Yaniv, K.\nScore: 23.8, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559123\nThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination. Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited. Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes. Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.\nEpididymal acquired sperm microRNAs modify post-fertilization embryonic gene expression\nAuthors: Trigg, N. A.; Conine, C. C.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-10-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.01.560377\nSperm small RNAs have emerged as important non-genetic contributors to embryogenesis and offspring health. A subset of sperm small RNAs are thought to be acquired during epididymal transit. However, the transfer of RNAs from the somatic epididymis to sperm has been questioned, and the identity of the specific small RNAs transferred remains unclear. Here, we employ Cre/Lox genetics to generate germline- and epididymal-specific Dgcr8 conditional knockout mice to investigate the dynamics of sperm microRNAs and their function in the early embryo. Testicular sperm from germline specific Dgcr8 knockout mice have reduced levels of 98 microRNAs. Enthrallingly, following epididymal transit the abundance of 59% of these microRNAs are restored to control levels. Conversely, sperm from epididymal Dgcr8 knockouts displayed a reduction of \u003e 3.4-fold in 25 miRNAs. This substantial loss of epididymal miRNAs in sperm was accompanied by transcriptomic changes in the embryo which was rescued by microinjection of epididymal miRNAs. These findings ultimately demonstrate the acquisition of miRNAs from the soma by sperm during epididymal transit and their subsequent regulation of post-fertilization embryonic gene expression.\nSingle-cell transcription mapping of murine and human mammary organoids responses to female hormones\nAuthors: Ruiz-Ortiz, J.; Lewis, S. M.; Ciccone, M. F.; Chatterjee, D.; Henry, S.; Siepel, A.; Dos Santos, C. O.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.28.559971\nDuring female adolescence and pregnancy, rising levels of hormones result in a cyclic source of signals that control the development of mammary tissue. While such alterations are well understood from a whole-gland perspective, the alterations that such hormones bring to organoid cultures derived from mammary glands have yet to be fully mapped. This is of special importance given that organoids are considered suitable systems to understand cross species breast development. Here we utilized single-cell transcriptional profiling to delineate responses of murine and human normal breast organoid systems to female hormones across evolutionary distinct species. Collectively, our study represents a molecular atlas of epithelial dynamics in response to estrogen and pregnancy hormones.\nSegmentation in tapeworms as a modified form of flatworm posterior regeneration involving Wnt and Hedgehog signalling\nAuthors: Jarero, F.; Baillie, A.; Riddiford, N.; Montagne, J.; Koziol, U.; Olson, P. D.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560491\nTapeworms are parasitic flatworms that lack key features conventionally used to define the head-tail axis in free-living organisms, resulting in long standing questions regarding the true orientation of their main body axis. As adults, most tapeworms also exhibit a segmented body which has been considered an adaptation unique to the group. Anteroposterior (AP) patterning in free-living flatworms is controlled by {beta}-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling and positional control genes are expressed by their musculature in highly regionalised domains. Here we investigate the expression of Wnt and Hedgehog components during the strobilar phase of the tapeworm life cycle during which larval tissues are lost and replaced through the continuous production of new tissues. Results reveal previously unidentified centres of signalling associated with their neuromuscular system and show that segments are marked by secondary, AP axes in agreement with the polarity of the primary body axis. Neuromuscular expression and communication between Wnt and Hedgehog signalling is consistent with embryonic and regenerative growth in planarians and is a common mechanism for establishing AP-polarised boundaries in a diverse range of segmented animals. Taken together our results suggest that segmentation in tapeworms represents a modified form of posterior regeneration, a common feature among flatworms.\nBMP signaling pathway member expression is enriched in enteric neural progenitors and required for zebrafish enteric nervous system development\nAuthors: Moore, J. A.; Noah, A. S.; Singleton, E. W.; Uribe, R. A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559191\nThe vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.\nLight-induced trapping of endogenous proteins reveals spatiotemporal roles of microtubule and kinesin-1 in dendrite patterning of Drosophila sensory neurons\nAuthors: Xu, Y.; Wang, B.; Bush, I.; Saunders, H. A.; Wildonger, J.; Han, C.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560303\nAnimal development involves numerous molecular events, whose spatiotemporal properties largely determine the biological outcomes. Conventional methods for studying gene function lack the necessary spatiotemporal resolution for precise dissection of developmental mechanisms. Optogenetic approaches are powerful alternatives, but most existing tools rely on exogenous designer proteins that produce narrow outputs and cannot be applied to diverse or endogenous proteins. To address this limitation, we developed OptoTrap, a light-inducible protein trapping system that allows manipulation of endogenous proteins tagged with GFP or split GFP. This system turns on fast and is reversible in minutes or hours. We generated OptoTrap variants optimized for neurons and epithelial cells and demonstrate effective trapping of endogenous proteins of diverse sizes, subcellular locations, and functions. Furthermore, OptoTrap allowed us to instantly disrupt microtubules and inhibit the kinesin-1 motor in specific dendritic branches of Drosophila sensory neurons. Using OptoTrap, we obtained direct evidence that microtubules support the growth of highly dynamic dendrites. Similarly, targeted manipulation of Kinesin heavy chain revealed differential spatiotemporal requirements of kinesin-1 in the patterning of low- and high-order dendritic branches, suggesting that different cargos are needed for the growth of these branches. OptoTrap allows for precise manipulation of endogenous proteins in a spatiotemporal manner and thus holds great promise for studying developmental mechanisms in a wide range of cell types and developmental stages.\nGut microbiota promotes enteroendocrine cell maturation and mitochondrial function\nAuthors: Alsudayri, A.; Perelman, S.; Chura, A.; Brewer, M.; McDevitt, M.; Drerup, C.; Ye, L.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.558332\nThe enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the intestine are crucial for sensing ingested nutrients and regulating feeding behavior. The means by which gut microbiota regulates the nutrient-sensing EEC activity is unclear. Our transcriptomic analysis of the EECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (CV) zebrafish revealed that commensal microbiota colonization significantly increased the expression of many genes that are associated with mitochondrial function. Using in vivo imaging and 3D automated cell tracking approach, we developed new methods to image and analyze the EECs cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium activity at cellular resolution in live zebrafish. Our data revealed that during the development, shortly after gut microbiota colonization, EECs briefly increased cytoplasm and mitochondrial Ca2+, a phenomenon we referred to as \"EEC awakening\". Following the EEC awakening, cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels but not mitochondrial Ca2+ level in the EECs decreased, resulting in a consistent increase in the mitochondrial-to-cytoplasmic Ca2+ ratio. The increased mitochondrial-to-cytoplasmic Ca2+ ratio is associated with the EEC maturation process. In immature EECs, we further discovered that their mitochondria are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. When EECs mature, their mitochondria are highly localized in the basal lateral membrane where EEC vesicle secretion occurs. Furthermore, CV EECs, but not GF EECs, exhibit spontaneous low-amplitude calcium fluctuation. The mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2+ ratio is significantly higher in CV EECs. When stimulating the CV zebrafish with nutrients like fatty acids, the fatty acid responsive EECs cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium levels both increase. Strikingly, when applied to GF zebrafish, the nutrient stimulation increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, but the nutrient stimulation induced mitochondrial Ca2+ increase that was observed in CV zebrafish was now nearly abolished. Together, our study reveals that commensal microbiota are critical in supporting EEC mitochondrial function and maturation. Selectively manipulating gut microbial signals to alter EEC mitochondrial function will provide new opportunities to change gut-brain nutrient sensing efficiency and feeding behavior.\nATF7IP2/MCAF2 directs H3K9 methylation and meiotic gene regulation in the male germline\nAuthors: Alavattam, K. G.; Esparza, J. M.; Hu, M.; Shimada, R.; Kohrs, A. R.; Abe, H.; Munakata, Y.; Otsuka, K.; Yoshimura, S.; Kitamura, Y.; Yeh, Y.-H.; Hu, Y.-C.; Kim, J.; Andreassen, P. R.; Ishiguro, K.-i.; Namekawa, S. H.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.30.560314\nH3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) plays emerging roles in gene regulation, beyond its accumulation on pericentric constitutive heterochromatin. It remains a mystery why and how H3K9me3 undergoes dynamic regulation in male meiosis. Here, we identify a novel, critical regulator of H3K9 methylation and spermatogenic heterochromatin organization: the germline-specific protein ATF7IP2 (MCAF2). We show that, in male meiosis, ATF7IP2 amasses on autosomal and X pericentric heterochromatin, spreads through the entirety of the sex chromosomes, and accumulates on thousands of autosomal promoters and retrotransposon loci. On the sex chromosomes, which undergo meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), the DNA damage response pathway recruits ATF7IP2 to X pericentric heterochromatin, where it facilitates the recruitment of SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K9me3. In the absence of ATF7IP2, male germ cells are arrested in meiotic prophase I. Analyses of ATF7IP2-deficient meiosis reveal its essential roles in the maintenance of MSCI, suppression of retrotransposons, and global upregulation of autosomal genes. We propose that ATF7IP2 is a downstream effector of the DDR pathway in meiosis that coordinates the organization of heterochromatin and gene regulation through the spatial regulation of SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 deposition.\nFAM210B is dispensable for erythroid differentiation in adult mice\nAuthors: Perfetto, M.; Rondelli, C. M.; Gillis, S.; Stratman, A. N.; Yien, Y. Y.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.559581\nIron plays a central role in cellular redox processes, but its ability to adopt multiple oxidation states also enables it to catalyze deleterious reactions. The requirement for iron in erythropoiesis has necessitated the evolution of mechanisms with which to handle the iron required for hemoglobinization. FAM210B was identified as a regulator of mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis in erythroid cell culture and zebrafish models. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that while FAM210B is required for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis under standard cell culture conditions, holotransferrin supplementation was sufficient to chemically complement the iron-deficient phenotype. As the biology of FAM210B is complex and context specific, and whole-organism studies on FAM210 proteins have been limited, we sought to unravel the role of FAM210B in erythropoiesis using knockout mice. We were surprised to discover that Fam210b-/- mice were viable and the adults did not have erythropoietic defects in the bone marrow. In contrast to studies in C. elegans, Fam210b-/- mice were also fertile. There were some modest phenotypes, such as a slight increase in lymphocytes and white cell count in Fam210b-/- females, as well as an increase in body weight in Fam210b-/- males. However, our findings suggest that FAM210B may play a more important role in cellular iron homeostasis under iron deficient conditions. Here, we will discuss the cell culture conditions used in iron metabolism studies that can account for the disparate finding on FAM210B function. Moving forward, resolving these discrepancies will be important in identifying novel iron homeostasis genes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Multicellular systems grow over the course of weeks from single cells to tissues or even full organisms composed of several thousands of cells, making live imaging of such samples challenging. To bridge these wide spatiotemporal scales, we present an open top dual view and dual illumination light sheet microscope dedicated for live imaging of large specimens at single cell resolution. The novel configuration of objectives together with a flexible and customizable multi-well mounting system combines dual view with high throughput multi-position imaging. We use the newly developed microscope to image a wide variety of samples and highlight its capabilities to gain quantitative single-cell information in large specimens such as mature intestinal organoids and gastruloids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination.

Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited.

Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes.

Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sperm small RNAs have emerged as important non-genetic contributors to embryogenesis and offspring health. A subset of sperm small RNAs are thought to be acquired during epididymal transit. However, the transfer of RNAs from the somatic epididymis to sperm has been questioned, and the identity of the specific small RNAs transferred remains unclear. Here, we employ Cre/Lox genetics to generate germline- and epididymal-specific Dgcr8 conditional knockout mice to investigate the dynamics of sperm microRNAs and their function in the early embryo. Testicular sperm from germline specific Dgcr8 knockout mice have reduced levels of 98 microRNAs. Enthrallingly, following epididymal transit the abundance of 59% of these microRNAs are restored to control levels. Conversely, sperm from epididymal Dgcr8 knockouts displayed a reduction of &gt; 3.4-fold in 25 miRNAs. This substantial loss of epididymal miRNAs in sperm was accompanied by transcriptomic changes in the embryo which was rescued by microinjection of epididymal miRNAs. These findings ultimately demonstrate the acquisition of miRNAs from the soma by sperm during epididymal transit and their subsequent regulation of post-fertilization embryonic gene expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During female adolescence and pregnancy, rising levels of hormones result in a cyclic source of signals that control the development of mammary tissue. While such alterations are well understood from a whole-gland perspective, the alterations that such hormones bring to organoid cultures derived from mammary glands have yet to be fully mapped. This is of special importance given that organoids are considered suitable systems to understand cross species breast development. Here we utilized single-cell transcriptional profiling to delineate responses of murine and human normal breast organoid systems to female hormones across evolutionary distinct species. Collectively, our study represents a molecular atlas of epithelial dynamics in response to estrogen and pregnancy hormones.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tapeworms are parasitic flatworms that lack key features conventionally used to define the head-tail axis in free-living organisms, resulting in long standing questions regarding the true orientation of their main body axis. As adults, most tapeworms also exhibit a segmented body which has been considered an adaptation unique to the group. Anteroposterior (AP) patterning in free-living flatworms is controlled by {beta}-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling and positional control genes are expressed by their musculature in highly regionalised domains. Here we investigate the expression of Wnt and Hedgehog components during the strobilar phase of the tapeworm life cycle during which larval tissues are lost and replaced through the continuous production of new tissues. Results reveal previously unidentified centres of signalling associated with their neuromuscular system and show that segments are marked by secondary, AP axes in agreement with the polarity of the primary body axis. Neuromuscular expression and communication between Wnt and Hedgehog signalling is consistent with embryonic and regenerative growth in planarians and is a common mechanism for establishing AP-polarised boundaries in a diverse range of segmented animals. Taken together our results suggest that segmentation in tapeworms represents a modified form of posterior regeneration, a common feature among flatworms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal development involves numerous molecular events, whose spatiotemporal properties largely determine the biological outcomes. Conventional methods for studying gene function lack the necessary spatiotemporal resolution for precise dissection of developmental mechanisms. Optogenetic approaches are powerful alternatives, but most existing tools rely on exogenous designer proteins that produce narrow outputs and cannot be applied to diverse or endogenous proteins. To address this limitation, we developed OptoTrap, a light-inducible protein trapping system that allows manipulation of endogenous proteins tagged with GFP or split GFP. This system turns on fast and is reversible in minutes or hours. We generated OptoTrap variants optimized for neurons and epithelial cells and demonstrate effective trapping of endogenous proteins of diverse sizes, subcellular locations, and functions. Furthermore, OptoTrap allowed us to instantly disrupt microtubules and inhibit the kinesin-1 motor in specific dendritic branches of Drosophila sensory neurons. Using OptoTrap, we obtained direct evidence that microtubules support the growth of highly dynamic dendrites. Similarly, targeted manipulation of Kinesin heavy chain revealed differential spatiotemporal requirements of kinesin-1 in the patterning of low- and high-order dendritic branches, suggesting that different cargos are needed for the growth of these branches. OptoTrap allows for precise manipulation of endogenous proteins in a spatiotemporal manner and thus holds great promise for studying developmental mechanisms in a wide range of cell types and developmental stages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in the intestine are crucial for sensing ingested nutrients and regulating feeding behavior. The means by which gut microbiota regulates the nutrient-sensing EEC activity is unclear. Our transcriptomic analysis of the EECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (CV) zebrafish revealed that commensal microbiota colonization significantly increased the expression of many genes that are associated with mitochondrial function. Using in vivo imaging and 3D automated cell tracking approach, we developed new methods to image and analyze the EECs cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium activity at cellular resolution in live zebrafish. Our data revealed that during the development, shortly after gut microbiota colonization, EECs briefly increased cytoplasm and mitochondrial Ca2&#43;, a phenomenon we referred to as &#34;EEC awakening&#34;. Following the EEC awakening, cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; levels but not mitochondrial Ca2&#43; level in the EECs decreased, resulting in a consistent increase in the mitochondrial-to-cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; ratio. The increased mitochondrial-to-cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; ratio is associated with the EEC maturation process. In immature EECs, we further discovered that their mitochondria are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. When EECs mature, their mitochondria are highly localized in the basal lateral membrane where EEC vesicle secretion occurs. Furthermore, CV EECs, but not GF EECs, exhibit spontaneous low-amplitude calcium fluctuation. The mitochondrial-to-cytoplasm Ca2&#43; ratio is significantly higher in CV EECs. When stimulating the CV zebrafish with nutrients like fatty acids, the fatty acid responsive EECs cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium levels both increase. Strikingly, when applied to GF zebrafish, the nutrient stimulation increases cytoplasmic Ca2&#43; levels, but the nutrient stimulation induced mitochondrial Ca2&#43; increase that was observed in CV zebrafish was now nearly abolished. Together, our study reveals that commensal microbiota are critical in supporting EEC mitochondrial function and maturation. Selectively manipulating gut microbial signals to alter EEC mitochondrial function will provide new opportunities to change gut-brain nutrient sensing efficiency and feeding behavior.</p>

        <p class="abstract">H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) plays emerging roles in gene regulation, beyond its accumulation on pericentric constitutive heterochromatin. It remains a mystery why and how H3K9me3 undergoes dynamic regulation in male meiosis. Here, we identify a novel, critical regulator of H3K9 methylation and spermatogenic heterochromatin organization: the germline-specific protein ATF7IP2 (MCAF2). We show that, in male meiosis, ATF7IP2 amasses on autosomal and X pericentric heterochromatin, spreads through the entirety of the sex chromosomes, and accumulates on thousands of autosomal promoters and retrotransposon loci. On the sex chromosomes, which undergo meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), the DNA damage response pathway recruits ATF7IP2 to X pericentric heterochromatin, where it facilitates the recruitment of SETDB1, a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K9me3. In the absence of ATF7IP2, male germ cells are arrested in meiotic prophase I. Analyses of ATF7IP2-deficient meiosis reveal its essential roles in the maintenance of MSCI, suppression of retrotransposons, and global upregulation of autosomal genes. We propose that ATF7IP2 is a downstream effector of the DDR pathway in meiosis that coordinates the organization of heterochromatin and gene regulation through the spatial regulation of SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 deposition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Iron plays a central role in cellular redox processes, but its ability to adopt multiple oxidation states also enables it to catalyze deleterious reactions. The requirement for iron in erythropoiesis has necessitated the evolution of mechanisms with which to handle the iron required for hemoglobinization. FAM210B was identified as a regulator of mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis in erythroid cell culture and zebrafish models. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that while FAM210B is required for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis under standard cell culture conditions, holotransferrin supplementation was sufficient to chemically complement the iron-deficient phenotype. As the biology of FAM210B is complex and context specific, and whole-organism studies on FAM210 proteins have been limited, we sought to unravel the role of FAM210B in erythropoiesis using knockout mice. We were surprised to discover that Fam210b-/- mice were viable and the adults did not have erythropoietic defects in the bone marrow. In contrast to studies in C. elegans, Fam210b-/- mice were also fertile. There were some modest phenotypes, such as a slight increase in lymphocytes and white cell count in Fam210b-/- females, as well as an increase in body weight in Fam210b-/- males. However, our findings suggest that FAM210B may play a more important role in cellular iron homeostasis under iron deficient conditions. Here, we will discuss the cell culture conditions used in iron metabolism studies that can account for the disparate finding on FAM210B function. Moving forward, resolving these discrepancies will be important in identifying novel iron homeostasis genes.</p>
