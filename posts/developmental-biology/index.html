L.; Tanentzapf, G.; Zaritsky, A.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568594\nTissue development occurs through a complex interplay between many individual cells. Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development. We demonstrated this intermediate scale of emergent signaling using Ca2+ signaling in the intact, ex vivo cultured, live developing Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG). Recurrent activation of these transient signaling communities defined self-organized signaling \"hotspots\" that receive and transmit information to facilitate repetitive interactions with non-hotspot neighbors, transfer information across cells, and regulate the developmental progression of hotspots. Overall, this work bridges the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior providing key mechanistic insight into how cells establish tissue-scale communication networks. Significance statementCells coordinate their internal state and behavior by exchanging information with other cells in their vicinity. These local interactions are integrated across space and time to enable synchronized function at the tissue scale. Using live microscopy imaging of the Drosophila Lymph Gland, and by applying computational analyses, we identified and characterized a new mode of cellular communication through self-organized recurring coordinated short-term activation at the intermediate scale of 3-8 cells, which we call \"hotspots\". We reveal that hotspots form over the course of tissue development, and are dependent on specific proteins, called gap-junctions, that enable communication between adjacent cells. Hotspots repeatedly transmit and retrieve information to and from their non-hotspot neighbors to spread information throughout the tissue to regulate and coordinate tissue function.\nMating-induced ecdysone in the testis disrupts soma-germline contacts and stem cell cytokinesis\nAuthors: Roach, T. V.; Lenhart, K. F.\nScore: 16.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562562\nGermline maintenance relies on adult stem cells to continually replenish lost gametes over a lifetime and respond to external cues altering the demands on the tissue. Mating worsens germline homeostasis over time, yet a negative impact on stem cell behavior has not been explored. Using extended live imaging of the Drosophila testis stem cell niche, we find that short periods of mating in young males disrupts cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs). This defect leads to failure of abscission, preventing release of differentiating cells from the niche. We find that GSC abscission failure is caused by increased ecdysone hormone signaling induced upon mating, which leads to disrupted somatic encystment of the germline. Abscission failure is rescued by isolating males from females but recurs with resumption of mating. Importantly, reiterative mating also leads to increased GSC loss, requiring increased restoration of stem cells via symmetric renewal and de-differentiation. Together, these results suggest a model whereby acute mating results in hormonal changes that negatively impact GSC cytokinesis but preserves the stem cell population.

F.; Besemer, R.; Schickle, A.; Changsut, I. V.; Borbee, E.; Sharp, K.; Babonis, L. S.\nScore: 42.2, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567385\nCnidarians have become valuable models for understanding many aspects of developmental biology including the evolution of body plan diversity, novel cell type specification, and regeneration. Most of our understanding of gene function during early development in cnidarians comes from a small number of experimental systems including the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Few molecular tools have been developed for use in hard corals, limiting our understanding of this diverse and ecologically important clade. Here, we report the development of a suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing gene expression during early development in the northern star coral, Astrangia poculata. We present methods for gene knockdown using short hairpin RNAs, gene overexpression using exogenous mRNAs, and endogenous gene tagging using CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in. Combined with our ability to control spawning in the laboratory, these tools make A. poculata a tractable experimental system for investigative studies of coral development. Further application of these tools will enable functional analyses of embryonic patterning and morphogenesis across Anthozoa and open new frontiers in coral biology research. Summary StatementThis study reports the development of the first transgenic knock-in coral, providing the opportunity to track the behavior of various cell types during early coral development.\nThe regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs in translational control during zebrafish embryogenesis\nAuthors: M. Reimao-Pinto, M.; Castillo-Hair, S. M.; Seelig, G.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 35.5, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568470\nThe 5' UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5' UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5' UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5' UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5' UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5' UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5' UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors. HighlightsO_LIIn vivo MPRA systematically interrogates the regulatory potential of endogenous 5' UTRs C_LIO_LIThe 5' UTR alone is sufficient to regulate the dynamics of ribosome recruitment during early embryogenesis C_LIO_LIThe MPRA identifies 5' UTR cis-regulatory motifs for translation initiation control C_LIO_LI5' UTR length, upstream AUGs and motif grammar contribute to the differential regulatory capability of 5' UTR switching isoforms C_LI\nArtificial environment impact: O2 concentration changes between IVM and IVF alter embryo production, metabolism, and epigenetic marks\nAuthors: Brunhara Cruz, J.; Miziara Nogueira, C.; Sangalli, J. R.; Perecin Nociti, R.; Ambrizi, D. R.; Bridi, A.; Pinzon, J.; Bianchi Rodrigues Alves, M.; Fernanda Martins Hossepian de Lima, V.; Watanabe, Y.; Fernandes Bressan, F.; Vieira Meirelles, F.; Vilar Sampaio, R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569089\nCreating an optimal in vitro cell culture environment requires careful simulation of all critical components, especially the gaseous atmosphere. Although it is well-documented that embryonic culture under low oxygen tension promotes embryonic development, little is known about the effect of changes in in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) on the epigenome. This study explores the role of oxygen tension variation in the early stages of in vitro production of bovine embryos and its impact on oxidative stress and epigenetic remodeling. We initially validated our system by scrutinizing the epigenetic effects on bovine fibroblasts. We observed that cell cultures under 20% O2 exhibited reduced H3K9me2 levels in early passages, which stabilized with prolonged cultivation and elevated gene expression of HIF2a and KDM5C. Our results reveal that oocytes maturing in 20% O2 environments have heightened levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), whereas blastocyst embryos maturing under reduced oxygen tension exhibit increased oxidative stress markers (NRF2, SOD1, SOD2), with upregulated transcripts observed in epigenetic remodelers (KDM5A, TET1). Elevated O2 levels in both IVM and IVF processes showcase improved embryo production. Maintaining consistent O2 levels at either 5% or 20% between IVM and IVF results in heightened GSH, reduced ROS, and increased levels of H3K9me2/3 in embryos. Finally, distinct DNA methylation patterns emerge, indicating higher levels in groups matured under low O2 tension and increased DNA hydroxymethylation in groups fertilized under low O2 tension. In conclusion, our comprehensive investigation underscores the critical role of oxygen concentration in shaping the epigenetic landscape during the early stages of in vitro culture. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing conditions in assisted reproductive technologies.\nFeedback control of organ size precision is mediated by BMP2-regulated apoptosis in the Drosophila eye\nAuthors: Navarro, T.; Iannini, A.; Neto, M.; Campoy-Lopez, A.; Munoz-Garcia, J.; Pereira, P. S.; Ares, S.; Casares, F.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.02.530805\nBiological processes are intrinsically noisy and yet, the result of development -like the species-specific size and shape of organs- is usually remarkably precise. This precision suggests the existence of mechanisms of feedback control that ensure that deviations from a target size are minimized. Still, we have very limited understanding of how these mechanisms operate. Here, we investigate the problem of organ size precision using the Drosophila eye. The size of the adult eye depends on the rates at which eye progenitor cells grow and differentiate. We first find that the progenitor net growth rate results from the balance between their proliferation and apoptosis, with this latter contributing to determining both final eye size and its variability. In turn, apoptosis of progenitor cells is hampered by Dpp, a BMP2/4 signaling molecule transiently produced by early differentiating retinal cells. Our genetic and computational experiments show how the status of retinal differentiation is communicated to progenitors through the differentiation-dependent production of Dpp which, by adjusting the rate of apoptosis, exerts a feedback control over the net growth of progenitors to reduce final eye size variability.\nThe cell cycle controls spindle architecture in Arabidopsis by modulating the augmin pathway\nAuthors: Motta, M. R.; Nedelec, F.; Woelken, E.; Saville, H.; Jacquerie, C.; Pastuglia, M.; Stolze, S. C.; Van De Slijke, E.; Chen, P.; Boettger, L.; Belcram, K.; Nakagami, H.; De Jaeger, G.; Bouchez, D.; Schnittger, A.\nScore: 27.1, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567058\nTo ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.\nComprehensive mapping of sensory and sympathetic innervation of the developing kidney\nAuthors: N'Guetta, P.-E. Y.; McLarnon, S. R.; Tassou, A.; Geron, M.; Scherrer, G.; O'Brien, L. L.\nScore: 102.0, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567276\nThe kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)+, substance P+, Trpv1+, and Piezo2+, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2+ sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.\nHemodynamics regulate spatiotemporal artery muscularization in the developing circle of Willis\nAuthors: Cheng, S.; Xia, I. F.; Wanner, R.; Abello, J.; Stratman, A. N.; Nicoli, S.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569622\nBrain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb+ common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb+ progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb+ recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.\nNephron progenitors rhythmically alternate between renewal and differentiation in synchrony with kidney branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Davis, S. N.; Grindel, S. H.; Viola, J. M.; Liu, G. Y.; Liu, J.; Qian, G.; Porter, C. M.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568157\nThe mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tissue development occurs through a complex interplay between many individual cells. Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development. We demonstrated this intermediate scale of emergent signaling using Ca2&#43; signaling in the intact, ex vivo cultured, live developing Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG). Recurrent activation of these transient signaling communities defined self-organized signaling &#34;hotspots&#34; that receive and transmit information to facilitate repetitive interactions with non-hotspot neighbors, transfer information across cells, and regulate the developmental progression of hotspots. Overall, this work bridges the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior providing key mechanistic insight into how cells establish tissue-scale communication networks.

Significance statementCells coordinate their internal state and behavior by exchanging information with other cells in their vicinity. These local interactions are integrated across space and time to enable synchronized function at the tissue scale. Using live microscopy imaging of the Drosophila Lymph Gland, and by applying computational analyses, we identified and characterized a new mode of cellular communication through self-organized recurring coordinated short-term activation at the intermediate scale of 3-8 cells, which we call &#34;hotspots&#34;. We reveal that hotspots form over the course of tissue development, and are dependent on specific proteins, called gap-junctions, that enable communication between adjacent cells. Hotspots repeatedly transmit and retrieve information to and from their non-hotspot neighbors to spread information throughout the tissue to regulate and coordinate tissue function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germline maintenance relies on adult stem cells to continually replenish lost gametes over a lifetime and respond to external cues altering the demands on the tissue. Mating worsens germline homeostasis over time, yet a negative impact on stem cell behavior has not been explored. Using extended live imaging of the Drosophila testis stem cell niche, we find that short periods of mating in young males disrupts cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs). This defect leads to failure of abscission, preventing release of differentiating cells from the niche. We find that GSC abscission failure is caused by increased ecdysone hormone signaling induced upon mating, which leads to disrupted somatic encystment of the germline. Abscission failure is rescued by isolating males from females but recurs with resumption of mating. Importantly, reiterative mating also leads to increased GSC loss, requiring increased restoration of stem cells via symmetric renewal and de-differentiation. Together, these results suggest a model whereby acute mating results in hormonal changes that negatively impact GSC cytokinesis but preserves the stem cell population.

        <p class="abstract">Cnidarians have become valuable models for understanding many aspects of developmental biology including the evolution of body plan diversity, novel cell type specification, and regeneration. Most of our understanding of gene function during early development in cnidarians comes from a small number of experimental systems including the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Few molecular tools have been developed for use in hard corals, limiting our understanding of this diverse and ecologically important clade. Here, we report the development of a suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing gene expression during early development in the northern star coral, Astrangia poculata. We present methods for gene knockdown using short hairpin RNAs, gene overexpression using exogenous mRNAs, and endogenous gene tagging using CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in. Combined with our ability to control spawning in the laboratory, these tools make A. poculata a tractable experimental system for investigative studies of coral development. Further application of these tools will enable functional analyses of embryonic patterning and morphogenesis across Anthozoa and open new frontiers in coral biology research.

Summary StatementThis study reports the development of the first transgenic knock-in coral, providing the opportunity to track the behavior of various cell types during early coral development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5&#39; UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5&#39; UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5&#39; UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5&#39; UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5&#39; UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5&#39; UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5&#39; UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5&#39; UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.

        <p class="abstract">Creating an optimal in vitro cell culture environment requires careful simulation of all critical components, especially the gaseous atmosphere. Although it is well-documented that embryonic culture under low oxygen tension promotes embryonic development, little is known about the effect of changes in in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) on the epigenome. This study explores the role of oxygen tension variation in the early stages of in vitro production of bovine embryos and its impact on oxidative stress and epigenetic remodeling. We initially validated our system by scrutinizing the epigenetic effects on bovine fibroblasts. We observed that cell cultures under 20% O2 exhibited reduced H3K9me2 levels in early passages, which stabilized with prolonged cultivation and elevated gene expression of HIF2a and KDM5C. Our results reveal that oocytes maturing in 20% O2 environments have heightened levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), whereas blastocyst embryos maturing under reduced oxygen tension exhibit increased oxidative stress markers (NRF2, SOD1, SOD2), with upregulated transcripts observed in epigenetic remodelers (KDM5A, TET1). Elevated O2 levels in both IVM and IVF processes showcase improved embryo production. Maintaining consistent O2 levels at either 5% or 20% between IVM and IVF results in heightened GSH, reduced ROS, and increased levels of H3K9me2/3 in embryos. Finally, distinct DNA methylation patterns emerge, indicating higher levels in groups matured under low O2 tension and increased DNA hydroxymethylation in groups fertilized under low O2 tension. In conclusion, our comprehensive investigation underscores the critical role of oxygen concentration in shaping the epigenetic landscape during the early stages of in vitro culture. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing conditions in assisted reproductive technologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological processes are intrinsically noisy and yet, the result of development -like the species-specific size and shape of organs- is usually remarkably precise. This precision suggests the existence of mechanisms of feedback control that ensure that deviations from a target size are minimized. Still, we have very limited understanding of how these mechanisms operate. Here, we investigate the problem of organ size precision using the Drosophila eye. The size of the adult eye depends on the rates at which eye progenitor cells grow and differentiate. We first find that the progenitor net growth rate results from the balance between their proliferation and apoptosis, with this latter contributing to determining both final eye size and its variability. In turn, apoptosis of progenitor cells is hampered by Dpp, a BMP2/4 signaling molecule transiently produced by early differentiating retinal cells. Our genetic and computational experiments show how the status of retinal differentiation is communicated to progenitors through the differentiation-dependent production of Dpp which, by adjusting the rate of apoptosis, exerts a feedback control over the net growth of progenitors to reduce final eye size variability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)&#43;, substance P&#43;, Trpv1&#43;, and Piezo2&#43;, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2&#43; sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb&#43; common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb&#43; progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb&#43; recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching  life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.</p>
