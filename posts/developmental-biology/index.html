Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.\nIntegrated Molecular-Phenotypic Profiling Reveals Metabolic Control of Morphological Variation in Stembryos\nAuthors: Villaronga Luque, A.; Savill, R. G.; Lopez-Anguita, N.; Bolondi, A.; Garai, S.; Gassaloglu, S. I.; Poddar, A.; Bulut-Karslioglu, A.; Veenvliet, J. V.\nScore: 46.4, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569921\nMammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.

O.; McCarty, O. J.; Wu, P.-H.; Rosenberg, A.; Wirtz, D.; Kiemen, A. L.\nScore: 30.2, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570622\nKidneys are among the most structurally complex organs in the body. Their architecture is critical to ensure proper function and is often impacted by diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Understanding the spatial interplay between the different structures of the nephron and renal vasculature is crucial. Recent efforts have demonstrated the value of three-dimensional (3D) imaging in revealing new insights into the various components of the kidney; however, these studies used antibodies or autofluorescence to detect structures and so were limited in their ability to compare the many subtle structures of the kidney at once. Here, through 3D reconstruction of fetal rhesus macaque kidneys at cellular resolution, we demonstrate the power of deep learning in exhaustively labelling seventeen microstructures of the kidney. Using these tissue maps, we interrogate the spatial distribution and spatial correlation of the glomeruli, renal arteries, and the nephron. This work demonstrates the power of deep learning applied to 3D tissue images to improve our ability to compare many microanatomical structures at once, paving the way for further works investigating renal pathologies.\nNanos2+ cells give rise to germline and somatic lineages in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis\nAuthors: Denner, A.; Steger, J.; Ries, A.; Morozova-Link, E.; Ritter, J.; Haas, F.; Cole, A. G.; Technau, U.\nScore: 16.3, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570436\nIn all animals, stem cell populations of varying potency facilitate regeneration and tissue homeostasis. Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, such as nanos, vasa and piwi. Interestingly, in animals, which are capable of whole-body regeneration, such as poriferans, hydrozoans and planarians, these genes are also expressed in somatic multi- and pluripotent stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. While multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have been identified in hydrozoans, they have not unambiguously been demonstrated in other cnidarian classes. Therefore, it is currently unclear if these stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin or have been adapted individually in different lineages as homoplasy. We therefore aimed to characterize stem cells expressing conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, to gain insight of shared traits governing the regulation of this enigmatic cell type. Through single cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline associated markers piwi1 and nanos2 in the soma and germline. Transgenic reporter genes reveal a lineage giving rise to somatic cells, consistent with a role as a multipotent stem cell population. Cell proliferation studies show that a fraction of nanos2+ reporter cells are cycling and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout show that nanos2+ progenitor cells are indispensable for male and female germline maintenance in Nematostella. This suggests nanos and piwi genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.\nDevelopment of Pial Collaterals by Extension of Pre-existing Artery Tips\nAuthors: Kumar, S.; Shanavas, N.; Ghosh, S.; Sivaramakrishnan, V.; Dwari, M.; Das, S.\nScore: 14.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570539\nPial collaterals provide protection from ischemic damage and improve prognosis of stroke patients. The origin or precise sequence of events underlying pial collateral development is unclear and has prevented clinicians from adapting new vascularization and regeneration therapies. We use genetic lineage tracing and intra-vital imaging of mouse brains at cellular resolution to show that during embryogenesis, pial collateral arteries develop from extension and anastomoses of pre-existing artery tips in a VegfR2 dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that an arterial receptor, Cxcr4, earlier shown to drive artery cell migration and coronary collateral development, is dispensable for formation and maintenance of pial collateral arteries. Our study reveals that collateral arteries of the brain are built by a unique mechanism, distinct from that of the heart.\nHuman naive stem cell models reveal the role of FGF signalling in hypoblast specification in the human embryo\nAuthors: Dattani, A.; Simon, E. C.; Radley, A.; Heydari, T.; Taheriabkenar, Y.; Carlisle, F.; Lin, S.; Mill, J.; Zandstra, P. W.; Nichols, J.; Guo, G.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569161\nThe hypoblast is an essential extra-embryonic tissue set aside within the inner cell mass early in mammalian embryo development, in the blastocyst. Research with human embryos is challenging. Thus, stem cell models that reproduce hypoblast differentiation provide valuable alternatives. We show here that human naive PSC to hypoblast differentiation proceeds via reversion to a transitional ICM-like state, from which hypoblast emerges in concordance with the trajectory in human blastocysts. We identified a window when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is critical for hypoblast specification. Revisiting FGF signalling in human embryos revealed that inhibition in the early blastocyst suppresses hypoblast formation. In vitro, the induction of hypoblast is synergistically enhanced by limiting trophectoderm and epiblast fates. This finding revises previous reports and establishes a conservation in lineage specification between mouse and human. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of human naive PSC-based models in elucidating mechanistic features of early human embryogenesis.\nGeometric Effects Position Renal Vesicles During Kidney Development\nAuthors: Mederacke, M.; Conrad, L.; Doumpas, N.; Vetter, R.; Iber, D.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2022.08.30.505859\nDuring kidney development, reciprocal signalling between the epithelium and the mesenchyme coordinates nephrogenesis with branching morphogenesis of the collecting ducts. The mechanism that positions the renal vesicles, and thus the nephrons, relative to the branching ureteric buds has remained elusive. By combining computational modelling and experiments, we show that geometric effects concentrate the key regulator, WNT9b, at the junctions between parent and daughter branches where renal vesicles emerge, even when uniformly expressed in the ureteric epithelium. This curvature effect might be a general paradigm to create non-uniform signalling in development.\nSelf-organised pattern formation in the developing neural tube by a temporal relay of BMP signalling\nAuthors: Lehr, S.; Brueckner, D. B.; Greunz-Schindler, M.; Minchington, T. G.; Merrin, J.; Hannezo, E.; Kicheva, A.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567070\nDeveloping tissues interpret dynamic changes in morphogen activity to generate cell type diversity. To quantitatively study BMP signalling dynamics in the vertebrate neural tube, we developed a new ES cell differentiation system tailored for growing tissues. Differentiating cells form striking self-organised patterns of dorsal neural tube cell types driven by sequential phases of BMP signalling that are observed both in vitro and in vivo. Data-driven biophysical modelling showed that these dynamics result from coupling fast negative feedback with slow positive regulation of signalling by the specification of an endogenous BMP source. Thus, in contrast to relays that propagate morphogen signalling in space, we uncover a BMP signalling relay that operates in time. This mechanism allows rapid initial concentrationsensitive response that is robustly terminated, thereby regulating balanced sequential cell type generation. Altogether, our study provides an experimental and theoretical framework to understand how signalling dynamics are exploited in developing tissues.\nHemodynamics regulate spatiotemporal artery muscularization in the developing circle of Willis\nAuthors: Cheng, S.; Xia, I. F.; Wanner, R.; Abello, J.; Stratman, A. N.; Nicoli, S.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569622\nBrain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb+ common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb+ progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb+ recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.\nNephron progenitors rhythmically alternate between renewal and differentiation in synchrony with kidney branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Davis, S. N.; Grindel, S. H.; Viola, J. M.; Liu, G. Y.; Liu, J.; Qian, G.; Porter, C. M.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568157\nThe mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During embryonic development, cells exit pluripotency to give rise to the three germ layers. Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.

        <p class="abstract">Kidneys are among the most structurally complex organs in the body. Their architecture is critical to ensure proper function and is often impacted by diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Understanding the spatial interplay between the different structures of the nephron and renal vasculature is crucial. Recent efforts have demonstrated the value of three-dimensional (3D) imaging in revealing new insights into the various components of the kidney; however, these studies used antibodies or autofluorescence to detect structures and so were limited in their ability to compare the many subtle structures of the kidney at once. Here, through 3D reconstruction of fetal rhesus macaque kidneys at cellular resolution, we demonstrate the power of deep learning in exhaustively labelling seventeen microstructures of the kidney. Using these tissue maps, we interrogate the spatial distribution and spatial correlation of the glomeruli, renal arteries, and the nephron. This work demonstrates the power of deep learning applied to 3D tissue images to improve our ability to compare many microanatomical structures at once, paving the way for further works investigating renal pathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In all animals, stem cell populations of varying potency facilitate regeneration and tissue homeostasis. Notably, germline stem cells in both vertebrates and invertebrates express highly conserved RNA-binding proteins, such as nanos, vasa and piwi. Interestingly, in animals, which are capable of whole-body regeneration, such as poriferans, hydrozoans and planarians, these genes are also expressed in somatic multi- and pluripotent stem cells, which led to the proposal that they had an ancestral role in all stem cells. While multi- and pluripotent interstitial stem cells have been identified in hydrozoans, they have not unambiguously been demonstrated in other cnidarian classes. Therefore, it is currently unclear if these stem cell systems share a common evolutionary origin or have been adapted individually in different lineages as homoplasy. We therefore aimed to characterize stem cells expressing conserved stem cell marker genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, to gain insight of shared traits governing the regulation of this enigmatic cell type. Through single cell transcriptomics, we identify cell populations expressing the germline associated markers piwi1 and nanos2 in the soma and germline. Transgenic reporter genes reveal a lineage giving rise to somatic cells, consistent with a role as a multipotent stem cell population. Cell proliferation studies show that a fraction of nanos2&#43; reporter cells are cycling and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene knockout show that nanos2&#43; progenitor cells are indispensable for male and female germline maintenance in Nematostella. This suggests nanos and piwi genes have a conserved role in somatic and germline stem cells in cnidarians.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pial collaterals provide protection from ischemic damage and improve prognosis of stroke patients. The origin or precise sequence of events underlying pial collateral development is unclear and has prevented clinicians from adapting new vascularization and regeneration therapies. We use genetic lineage tracing and intra-vital imaging of mouse brains at cellular resolution to show that during embryogenesis, pial collateral arteries develop from extension and anastomoses of pre-existing artery tips in a VegfR2 dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that an arterial receptor, Cxcr4, earlier shown to drive artery cell migration and coronary collateral development, is dispensable for formation and maintenance of pial collateral arteries. Our study reveals that collateral arteries of the brain are built by a unique mechanism, distinct from that of the heart.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The hypoblast is an essential extra-embryonic tissue set aside within the inner cell mass early in mammalian embryo development, in the blastocyst. Research with human embryos is challenging. Thus, stem cell models that reproduce hypoblast differentiation provide valuable alternatives. We show here that human naive PSC to hypoblast differentiation proceeds via reversion to a transitional ICM-like state, from which hypoblast emerges in concordance with the trajectory in human blastocysts. We identified a window when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is critical for hypoblast specification. Revisiting FGF signalling in human embryos revealed that inhibition in the early blastocyst suppresses hypoblast formation. In vitro, the induction of hypoblast is synergistically enhanced by limiting trophectoderm and epiblast fates. This finding revises previous reports and establishes a conservation in lineage specification between mouse and human. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of human naive PSC-based models in elucidating mechanistic features of early human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During kidney development, reciprocal signalling between the epithelium and the mesenchyme coordinates nephrogenesis with branching morphogenesis of the collecting ducts. The mechanism that positions the renal vesicles, and thus the nephrons, relative to the branching ureteric buds has remained elusive. By combining computational modelling and experiments, we show that geometric effects concentrate the key regulator, WNT9b, at the junctions between parent and daughter branches where renal vesicles emerge, even when uniformly expressed in the ureteric epithelium. This curvature effect might be a general paradigm to create non-uniform signalling in development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developing tissues interpret dynamic changes in morphogen activity to generate cell type diversity. To quantitatively study BMP signalling dynamics in the vertebrate neural tube, we developed a new ES cell differentiation system tailored for growing tissues. Differentiating cells form striking self-organised patterns of dorsal neural tube cell types driven by sequential phases of BMP signalling that are observed both in vitro and in vivo. Data-driven biophysical modelling showed that these dynamics result from coupling fast negative feedback with slow positive regulation of signalling by the specification of an endogenous BMP source. Thus, in contrast to relays that propagate morphogen signalling in space, we uncover a BMP signalling relay that operates in time. This mechanism allows rapid initial concentrationsensitive response that is robustly terminated, thereby regulating balanced sequential cell type generation. Altogether, our study provides an experimental and theoretical framework to understand how signalling dynamics are exploited in developing tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb&#43; common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb&#43; progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb&#43; recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching  life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.</p>
