P.; Streichan, S. J.; Vergassola, M.; Di Talia, S.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561879\nDuring embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.\nFin elaboration via anterior-posterior regulation by Hedgehog signaling in teleosts\nAuthors: Tanaka, Y.; Okayama, S.; Ansai, S.; Abe, G.; Tamura, K.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.10.557878\nFins in fishes are appendages that serve to facilitate maneuvering in water. Compared to their ancestral state, teleosts have reduced radial bones in their paired fin skeletons and have acquired elaborated, agile paired fins. We found that mutation of Hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip), encoding an antagonist of Hedgehog signaling, leads to an increase of radial bones in a localized region and replicates the ancestral state. Interestingly, the caudal fin, which has undergone a reduction of skeleton structure in teleosts, as well as the paired fins, exhibit a regional-specific branching of the 2nd hypural in hhip-/- mutant zebrafish. These results imply that Hedgehog signaling is repressed during fin development in teleosts compared to the ancestral state. Molecular genetic analyses show that shhb, one of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) genes, encoding one of the Hedgehog ligands in teleosts, is expressed during subdivision of endochondral components in paired fin skeletal development, and that mutation of shhb leads to hypoplasia of the paired fin skeletons. Therefore, we suggest that paired and caudal fins in fishes possess a specific region susceptible to Hedgehog signaling. The reduction of radial bones by repressive regulation of Hedgehog signaling may induce fin elaboration in teleosts.\nRapid generation of single-insertion transgenics by Tol2 transposition in zebrafish\nAuthors: Kalvaityte, M.; Gabrilaviciute, S.; Balciunas, D.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561928\nThe Tol2 transposable element is the most widely used transgenesis tool in zebrafish. However, its high activity almost always leads to multiple unlinked integrations of the transgenic cassette in F1 fish. Each of these transgenes is susceptible to position effects from surrounding regulatory landscape, which can lead to altered expression and, consequently, activity. Scientists therefore must strike a balance between the need to maximize reproducibility by establishing single-insertion transgenic lines and the need to complete experiments within a reasonable timeframe. In this article, we introduce a simple competitive dilution strategy for rapid generation of single-insertion transgenics. By using cry:BFP reporter plasmid as a competitor, we achieved a nearly fourfold reduction in the number of the transgene of interest (TgOI) integrations while simultaneously increasing the proportion of single-insertion F1 generation transgenics to over 50%. We also observed variations in TgOI expression among independent single-insertion transgenics, highlighting that the commonly used ubiquitous ubb promoter is susceptible to position effects. Wide application of our competitive dilution strategy will save time, reduce animal usage, and improve reproducibility of zebrafish research. SummaryCompetitive dilution of Tol2 transgenesis vectors facilitates isolation of single-insertion transgenic zebrafish lines in the F1 generation, reducing animal usage, improving reproducibility, and saving time.\nVisualisation of gene expression within the context of tissues: an X-ray computed tomography-based multimodal approach\nAuthors: Kairiss, K.; Sokolova, N.; Zilova, L.; Schlagheck, C.; Reinhardt, R.; Baumbach, T.; Farago, T.; van de Kamp, T.; Wittbrodt, J.; Weinhardt, V.\nScore: 7.6, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561491\nThe development of an organism is orchestrated by the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Accurate visualisation of gene expression patterns in the context of the surrounding tissues offers a glimpse into the mechanisms that drive morphogenesis. We developed correlative light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography approach to map gene expression patterns to the whole organisms 3D anatomy at cellular resolution. We show that this multimodal approach is applicable to gene expression visualised by protein-specific antibodies and fluorescence RNA in situ hybridisation, offering a detailed understanding of individual phenotypic variations in model organisms. Furthermore, the approach provides a unique possibility to identify tissues together with their 3D cellular and molecular composition in anatomically less-defined in vitro models, such as organoids. We anticipate that the visual and quantitative insights into the 3D distribution of gene expression within tissue architecture, by the multimodal approach developed here, will be equally valuable for reference atlases of model organisms development, as well as for comprehensive screens and morphogenesis studies of in vitro models.\nStorage cell proliferation during somatic growth establishes that tardigrades are not eutelic organisms\nAuthors: Quiroga-Artigas, G.; Moriel-Carretero, M.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.562009\nTardigrades, microscopic ecdysozoans renowned for their resilience to extreme environments, have long been thought to maintain a constant cell number after completing embryonic development, a phenomenon known as eutely. However, sporadic reports of dividing cells have raised questions about this assumption. In this study, we investigated whether tardigrades truly exhibit a fixed cell number during somatic growth using the model species Hypsibius exemplaris. Comparing hatchlings to adults, we observed an overall increase in the number of storage cells, a tardigrade cell type involved in nutrient storage. To assess cell proliferation, we monitored DNA replication via the incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). A significantly higher number of storage cells incorporated EdU while animals were still growing. Starvation halted both animal growth and storage cell proliferation, linking the two processes. Additionally, we found that EdU incorporation in storage cells is associated with molting, a critical process in tardigrade post-embryonic development, since it involves cuticle renewal to enable further growth. Finally, we show that hydroxyurea, a drug that slows down DNA replication progression, strongly reduces the number of EdU+ cells and results in molting-related fatalities. Our data not only provide a comprehensive picture of replication events during tardigrade growth but also highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. This study definitively challenges the notion of eutely in tardigrades, offering promising avenues for exploring cell cycle, replication stress, and DNA damage management in these remarkable creatures as genetic manipulation techniques emerge within the tardigrade research field.\nCapitella teleta gets left out: Possible evolutionary shift causes loss of left tissues rather than increased neural tissue from dominant-negative BMPR1\nAuthors: Webster, N. B.; Meyer, N. P.\nScore: 8.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560756\nBackgroundThe evolution of centralized nervous systems (CNSs) a fascinating and complex topic; further work is needed to understand the genetic and developmental homology between organisms with a CNS. Research into a limited number of species suggests that CNSs may be homologous across Bilateria. This hypothesis is based in part on similar functions of BMP signaling in establishing fates along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis including limiting neural specification to one region of ectoderm. From an evolutionary-developmental perspective, the best way to understand a system is to explore it in a wide range of organisms to create a full picture. MethodsHere we expand our understanding of BMP signaling in Spiralia, the third major clade of bilaterians, by examining phenotypes after expression of a dominant-negative BMP Receptor 1 and after knock-out of the putative BMP antagonist Chordin-like using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the annelid Capitella teleta (Pleistoannelida). ResultsEctopic expression of the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 did not increase CNS tissue or alter overall D-V axis formation in the trunk. Instead, we observed a unique asymmetric phenotype: a distinct loss of left tissues including the left eye, brain, foregut, and trunk mesoderm. Adding ectopic BMP4 early during cleavage stages reversed the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 phenotype, leading to a similar loss or reduction of right tissues instead. Surprisingly, a similar asymmetric loss of left tissues was evident from CRISPR knock-out of Cte-Chordin-like but concentrated in the trunk rather than the episphere. ConclusionsWe further solidify the hypothesis that the function of BMP signaling during establishment of the D-V axis and CNS is fundamentally different in at least Pleistoannelida, possibly in Spiralia, and is not required for nervous system delimitation in this group. Our results support hypotheses of either multiple evolutionary origins of CNSs across Bilateria or divergence in the molecular mechanisms of CNS specification and D-V axis formation in annelids.\nDisrupted endosomal trafficking of the Vangl-Celsr polarity complex causes congenital anomalies in trachea-esophageal separation\nAuthors: Edwards, N. A.; Kashyap, A.; Warren, A.; Agricola, Z.; Kenny, A. P.; Shen, Y.; Chung, W. K.; Zorn, A. M.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561909\nThe developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.\nA human prenatal skin cell atlas reveals immune cell regulation of skin morphogenesis\nAuthors: Gopee, N.

T.; Rajan, N.; Ballereau, S.; Li, T.; Moore, J.; Horsfall, D.; Bas\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.556307\nHuman prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells including macrophages, and whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. We assembled the first comprehensive multi-omic reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7-16 post-conception weeks), combining single cell and spatial transcriptomic data, to characterise the skins microenvironmental cellular organisation. This revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins formation of hair follicles, has implications for scarless wound healing, and is critical for skin angiogenesis. We benchmarked a skin organoid model, derived from human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, against prenatal and adult skin, demonstrating close recapitulation of the epidermal and dermal skin components during hair follicle development. Notably, the skin organoid lacked immune cells and had markedly diminished endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. From our in vivo skin cell atlas data, we found that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors play a key role in driving endothelial development prenatally. Indeed, vascular network formation was enhanced following transfer of autologous iPS-derived macrophages into both endothelial cell angiogenesis assays and skin organoid cultures. In summary, innate immune cells moonlight as key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional immune roles, a function they achieve via extensive crosstalk with non-immune cells. Finally, we leveraged our human prenatal skin cell atlas to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders.\nAdvancements in Human Breast Organoid Culture: Modeling Complex Tissue Structures and Developmental Insights\nAuthors: Rauner, G.; Traugh, N.; Trepicchio, C.; Parrish, M. E.; Mushayandebvu, K.; Kuperwasser, C.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.02.560364\nOrganoids have been widely used for studying tissue growth and modeling diseases, but achieving physiologically relevant architecture, size, and function has remained a challenge. Here, we develop a next-generation organotypic culture method that enables the formation of a highly patterned, complex, branched tissue that is spatially organized to accurately recapitulate the morphology, scale, cellular, transcriptional, and tissue-level heterogeneity of human breast tissue. Hormone responsiveness of organoids is also a feature allowing for examination of androgen therapy or post-menopausal changes to breast tissue development and regeneration. Live imaging allows for studying stem cell dynamics during organoid formation and is adaptable to a high throughput setting. Real-time imaging of organoid formation reveals activation of latent epithelial organogenesis programs and inductive cellular dynamics that drive formation of a miniature breast tissue along with its mesenchyme akin to tissue stroma. By advancing human breast organoid technology, this model can elucidate cell- and tissue-level consequences to hormonal changes and therapy. In addition, this method can lead to new insights into the cellular, molecular, and tissue-level processes involved in organogenesis and regeneration, as well as disease.\nA distinct subpopulation of adipocytes in adult perirenal adipose tissue arises through brown-to-white conversion but reverts to a thermogenic phenotype upon cold exposure\nAuthors: Zhang, H.; Li, Y.; Ibanez, C. F.; Xie, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561821\nPerirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1-/Cidea+ adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During embryogenesis, the earliest cell fate decision is often linked to nuclear positioning, whose control arises from the integration of the cell cycle oscillator and associated cytoskeletal dynamics. Yet, the mechanisms that ensure that the correct number of nuclei move to the appropriate place remain poorly understood. Here, using light sheet microscopy, we show that in Drosophila embryos spindle orientation controls which nuclei migrate towards the cortex and which remains inside the embryo, thereby determining nuclear fate and the number of cells undergoing development. Combining computational methods inspired by integral geometry and manipulations of cell cycle genes, we show that spindle orientation is controlled by topological spindle-spindle interactions and not by internuclear distance. Using arguments describing the behavior of space-filling systems, we develop a theory for topological dependency in microtubule structures. Our work shows how topological interplay of microtubule mechanics can ensure robust control of density and cell fate determination.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fins in fishes are appendages that serve to facilitate maneuvering in water. Compared to their ancestral state, teleosts have reduced radial bones in their paired fin skeletons and have acquired elaborated, agile paired fins. We found that mutation of Hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip), encoding an antagonist of Hedgehog signaling, leads to an increase of radial bones in a localized region and replicates the ancestral state. Interestingly, the caudal fin, which has undergone a reduction of skeleton structure in teleosts, as well as the paired fins, exhibit a regional-specific branching of the 2nd hypural in hhip-/- mutant zebrafish. These results imply that Hedgehog signaling is repressed during fin development in teleosts compared to the ancestral state. Molecular genetic analyses show that shhb, one of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) genes, encoding one of the Hedgehog ligands in teleosts, is expressed during subdivision of endochondral components in paired fin skeletal development, and that mutation of shhb leads to hypoplasia of the paired fin skeletons. Therefore, we suggest that paired and caudal fins in fishes possess a specific region susceptible to Hedgehog signaling. The reduction of radial bones by repressive regulation of Hedgehog signaling may induce fin elaboration in teleosts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Tol2 transposable element is the most widely used transgenesis tool in zebrafish. However, its high activity almost always leads to multiple unlinked integrations of the transgenic cassette in F1 fish. Each of these transgenes is susceptible to position effects from surrounding regulatory landscape, which can lead to altered expression and, consequently, activity. Scientists therefore must strike a balance between the need to maximize reproducibility by establishing single-insertion transgenic lines and the need to complete experiments within a reasonable timeframe. In this article, we introduce a simple competitive dilution strategy for rapid generation of single-insertion transgenics. By using cry:BFP reporter plasmid as a competitor, we achieved a nearly fourfold reduction in the number of the transgene of interest (TgOI) integrations while simultaneously increasing the proportion of single-insertion F1 generation transgenics to over 50%. We also observed variations in TgOI expression among independent single-insertion transgenics, highlighting that the commonly used ubiquitous ubb promoter is susceptible to position effects. Wide application of our competitive dilution strategy will save time, reduce animal usage, and improve reproducibility of zebrafish research.

SummaryCompetitive dilution of Tol2 transgenesis vectors facilitates isolation of single-insertion transgenic zebrafish lines in the F1 generation, reducing animal usage, improving reproducibility, and saving time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The development of an organism is orchestrated by the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Accurate visualisation of gene expression patterns in the context of the surrounding tissues offers a glimpse into the mechanisms that drive morphogenesis. We developed correlative light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography approach to map gene expression patterns to the whole organisms 3D anatomy at cellular resolution. We show that this multimodal approach is applicable to gene expression visualised by protein-specific antibodies and fluorescence RNA in situ hybridisation, offering a detailed understanding of individual phenotypic variations in model organisms. Furthermore, the approach provides a unique possibility to identify tissues together with their 3D cellular and molecular composition in anatomically less-defined in vitro models, such as organoids. We anticipate that the visual and quantitative insights into the 3D distribution of gene expression within tissue architecture, by the multimodal approach developed here, will be equally valuable for reference atlases of model organisms development, as well as for comprehensive screens and morphogenesis studies of in vitro models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades, microscopic ecdysozoans renowned for their resilience to extreme environments, have long been thought to maintain a constant cell number after completing embryonic development, a phenomenon known as eutely. However, sporadic reports of dividing cells have raised questions about this assumption. In this study, we investigated whether tardigrades truly exhibit a fixed cell number during somatic growth using the model species Hypsibius exemplaris. Comparing hatchlings to adults, we observed an overall increase in the number of storage cells, a tardigrade cell type involved in nutrient storage. To assess cell proliferation, we monitored DNA replication via the incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2&#39;-deoxyuridine (EdU). A significantly higher number of storage cells incorporated EdU while animals were still growing. Starvation halted both animal growth and storage cell proliferation, linking the two processes. Additionally, we found that EdU incorporation in storage cells is associated with molting, a critical process in tardigrade post-embryonic development, since it involves cuticle renewal to enable further growth. Finally, we show that hydroxyurea, a drug that slows down DNA replication progression, strongly reduces the number of EdU&#43; cells and results in molting-related fatalities. Our data not only provide a comprehensive picture of replication events during tardigrade growth but also highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. This study definitively challenges the notion of eutely in tardigrades, offering promising avenues for exploring cell cycle, replication stress, and DNA damage management in these remarkable creatures as genetic manipulation techniques emerge within the tardigrade research field.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe evolution of centralized nervous systems (CNSs) a fascinating and complex topic; further work is needed to understand the genetic and developmental homology between organisms with a CNS. Research into a limited number of species suggests that CNSs may be homologous across Bilateria. This hypothesis is based in part on similar functions of BMP signaling in establishing fates along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis including limiting neural specification to one region of ectoderm. From an evolutionary-developmental perspective, the best way to understand a system is to explore it in a wide range of organisms to create a full picture.

MethodsHere we expand our understanding of BMP signaling in Spiralia, the third major clade of bilaterians, by examining phenotypes after expression of a dominant-negative BMP Receptor 1 and after knock-out of the putative BMP antagonist Chordin-like using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the annelid Capitella teleta (Pleistoannelida).

ResultsEctopic expression of the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 did not increase CNS tissue or alter overall D-V axis formation in the trunk. Instead, we observed a unique asymmetric phenotype: a distinct loss of left tissues including the left eye, brain, foregut, and trunk mesoderm. Adding ectopic BMP4 early during cleavage stages reversed the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 phenotype, leading to a similar loss or reduction of right tissues instead. Surprisingly, a similar asymmetric loss of left tissues was evident from CRISPR knock-out of Cte-Chordin-like but concentrated in the trunk rather than the episphere.

ConclusionsWe further solidify the hypothesis that the function of BMP signaling during establishment of the D-V axis and CNS is fundamentally different in at least Pleistoannelida, possibly in Spiralia, and is not required for nervous system delimitation in this group. Our results support hypotheses of either multiple evolutionary origins of CNSs across Bilateria or divergence in the molecular mechanisms of CNS specification and D-V axis formation in annelids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells including macrophages, and whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. We assembled the first comprehensive multi-omic reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7-16 post-conception weeks), combining single cell and spatial transcriptomic data, to characterise the skins microenvironmental cellular organisation. This revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins formation of hair follicles, has implications for scarless wound healing, and is critical for skin angiogenesis. We benchmarked a skin organoid model, derived from human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, against prenatal and adult skin, demonstrating close recapitulation of the epidermal and dermal skin components during hair follicle development. Notably, the skin organoid lacked immune cells and had markedly diminished endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. From our in vivo skin cell atlas data, we found that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors play a key role in driving endothelial development prenatally. Indeed, vascular network formation was enhanced following transfer of autologous iPS-derived macrophages into both endothelial cell angiogenesis assays and skin organoid cultures. In summary, innate immune cells moonlight as key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional immune roles, a function they achieve via extensive crosstalk with non-immune cells. Finally, we leveraged our human prenatal skin cell atlas to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids have been widely used for studying tissue growth and modeling diseases, but achieving physiologically relevant architecture, size, and function has remained a challenge. Here, we develop a next-generation organotypic culture method that enables the formation of a highly patterned, complex, branched tissue that is spatially organized to accurately recapitulate the morphology, scale, cellular, transcriptional, and tissue-level heterogeneity of human breast tissue. Hormone responsiveness of organoids is also a feature allowing for examination of androgen therapy or post-menopausal changes to breast tissue development and regeneration. Live imaging allows for studying stem cell dynamics during organoid formation and is adaptable to a high throughput setting. Real-time imaging of organoid formation reveals activation of latent epithelial organogenesis programs and inductive cellular dynamics that drive formation of a miniature breast tissue along with its mesenchyme akin to tissue stroma. By advancing human breast organoid technology, this model can elucidate cell- and tissue-level consequences to hormonal changes and therapy. In addition, this method can lead to new insights into the cellular, molecular, and tissue-level processes involved in organogenesis and regeneration, as well as disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1-/Cidea&#43; adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes.</p>
