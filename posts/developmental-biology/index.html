R.; Tassou, A.; Geron, M.; Scherrer, G.; O'Brien, L. L.\nScore: 98.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567276\nThe kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)+, substance P+, Trpv1+, and Piezo2+, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2+ sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.\nThe regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs in translational control during zebrafish embryogenesis\nAuthors: M. Reimao-Pinto, M.; Castillo-Hair, S. M.; Seelig, G.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 29.5, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568470\nThe 5' UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5' UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5' UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5' UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5' UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5' UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5' UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.\nCadherins modulate the self-organizing potential of gastruloids\nAuthors: Mayran, A.; Kolly, D.; Lopez-Delisle, L.; Romaniuk, Y.; Leonardi, M.; Cossy, A.-C.; Lacroix, T.; Amandio, A.-R.; Osteil, P.; Duboule, D.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.22.568291\nGastruloids have recently emerged as an efficient four-dimensional model for studying some aspects of post-implantation embryonic patterning. They undergo gastrulation-like processes leading to the self-organization into highly reproducible biological objects. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this remarkable property. We report that self-organization competence is associated with a cell-specific coordination of a Cadherin switch. We find that N-Cadherin hinders gastruloids morphogenetic competence, for its inactivation leads to the formation of trunk-like structures in absence of extra-cellular matrix analogues. In contrast, E-Cadherin repression by Snai1 is critical for self-organization: Snai1 establishes a cell-specific repressive pace by triggering the repression of a pluripotency-associated transcription program and its chromatin landscape, thus allowing a proper transition from E- to N-Cadherin to occur. Altogether, this work establishes a molecular mechanism that integrates the exit from pluripotency and the pace of cell differentiation, leading to the observed self-organizing potential of gastruloids.\nThe cell cycle controls spindle architecture in Arabidopsis by modulating the augmin pathway\nAuthors: Motta, M. R.; Nedelec, F.; Woelken, E.; Saville, H.; Jacquerie, C.; Pastuglia, M.; Stolze, S. C.; Van De Slijke, E.; Chen, P.; Boettger, L.; Belcram, K.; Nakagami, H.; De Jaeger, G.; Bouchez, D.; Schnittger, A.\nScore: 25.1, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567058\nTo ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.\nModelling variability and heterogeneity of EMT scenarios highlights nuclear positioning and protrusions as main drivers of extrusion\nAuthors: Plunder, S.; Danesin, C.; Glise, B.; Ferreira, M. A.; Merino Aceituno, S.; THEVENEAU, E.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567510\nEpithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a key process in physiological and pathological settings (i.e. development, fibrosis, cancer). EMT is often presented as a linear sequence of events including (i) disassembly of cell-cell junctions, (ii) loss of epithelial polarity and (iii) reorganization of the cytoskeleton leading to basal extrusion from the epithelium. Once out, cells can adopt a migratory phenotype with a front-rear polarity and may additionally become invasive. While this stereotyped sequence can occur, many in vivo observations have challenged this notion. It is now accepted that there are multiple EMT scenarios and that cell populations implementing EMT are often heterogeneous. However, the relative importance of each EMT step towards extrusion is unclear. Similarly, the overall impact of variability and heterogeneity on the efficiency and directionality of cell extrusion has not been assessed. Here we used computational modelling of a pseudostratified epithelium to model multiple EMT-like scenarios. We confronted these in silico data to the EMT occurring during neural crest delamination. Overall, our simulated and biological data point to a key role of nuclear positioning and protrusive activity to generate timely basal extrusion of cells and suggest a non-linear model of EMT allowing multiple scenarios to co-exist.\nNephron progenitors rhythmically alternate between renewal and differentiation in synchrony with kidney branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Davis, S. N.; Grindel, S. H.; Viola, J. M.; Liu, G. Y.; Liu, J.; Qian, G.; Porter, C. M.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568157\nThe mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.\nCohesin composition and dosage independently affect early development in zebrafish\nAuthors: Labudina, A.; Meier, M.; Gimenez, G.; Tatarakis, D.; Ketharnathan, S.; Mackie, B.; Schilling, T. F.; Antony, J.; Horsfield, J. A.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568176\nCohesin, a chromatin-associated protein complex with four core subunits (Smc1a, Smc3, Rad21 and either Stag1 or 2), has a central role in cell proliferation and gene expression in metazoans. Human developmental disorders termed \"cohesinopathies\" are characterised by germline mutations in cohesin or its regulators that do not entirely eliminate cohesin function. However, it is not clear if mutations in individual cohesin subunits have independent developmental consequences. Here we show that zebrafish rad21 or stag2 mutants independently influence embryonic tailbud development. Both mutants have altered mesoderm induction, but only homozygous or heterozygous rad21 mutation affects cell cycle gene expression. stag2 mutants have narrower notochords and reduced Wnt signaling in neuromesodermal progenitors as revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing. Stimulation of Wnt signaling rescues transcription and morphology in stag2, but not rad21 mutants. Our results suggest that mutations altering the quantity versus composition of cohesin have independent developmental consequences, with implications for the understanding and management of cohesinopathies. TeaserViable zebrafish mutants show that cohesin complex quantity versus composition lead to different transcriptional and developmental outcomes in the early embryo.\nGenetically encoded affinity reagents (GEARs): A toolkit for visualizing and manipulating endogenous protein function in vivo.\nAuthors: Boswell, C. W.; Hoppe, C.; Sherrard, A.; Miao, L.; Kojima, M. L.; Krishna, S.; Musaev, D.; Zhao, N.; Stasevich, T. J.; Giraldez, A. J.\nScore: 41.1, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567075\nProbing endogenous protein localization and function in vivo remains challenging due to laborious gene targeting and monofunctional alleles. Here, we develop a multifunctional, universal, and adaptable toolkit based on genetically encoded affinity reagents (GEARs). GEARs use nanobodies and single chain variable fragments (scFv), which recognize small epitopes, enabling fluorescent visualization and selective degradation of protein targets in vivo. Furthermore, we delineate a CRISPR/Cas9-based epitope tagging pipeline to demonstrate its utility for producing knock-in alleles that have broad multifunctionality. We use GEARs to examine the native behaviour of the pioneer transcription factor Nanog and the planar cell polarity protein Vangl2 during early zebrafish development. Together, this toolkit provides a versatile system for probing and perturbing endogenous protein function while circumventing challenges associated with conventional gene targeting and is broadly available to the model organism community.\nNonlinear readout of spatial cues underlies robustness of asymmetric cell division\nAuthors: Rodrigues, N. T. L.; Bland, T.; Ng, K.; Hirani, N.; Goehring, N.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568006\nA key challenge in the development of an organism is to maintain robust phenotypic outcomes in the face of perturbation. Yet, how such robust outcomes are encoded by developmental networks remains poorly explored. Here we use the C. elegans zygote as a model to understand sources of developmental robustness during PAR polarity-dependent asymmetric cell division. By quantitatively linking alterations in protein dosage to phenotype in individual embryos, we show that spatial information in the zygote is read out in a highly nonlinear fashion and, as a result, phenotypes are highly canalized against substantial variation in input signals. Specifically, our data point towards an intrinsic robustness of the conserved PAR polarity network that renders polarity axis specification resistant to variations in both the strength of upstream symmetry-breaking cues and PAR protein dosage. At the same time, we find that downstream pathways involved in cell size and fate asymmetry are similarly robust to dosage-dependent changes in the local concentrations of PAR proteins, implying non-trivial complexity in translating PAR signals into pathway outputs. We propose that \"quantitative decoupling\" of symmetry-breaking, polarity, and asymmetric division modules acts to suppress the accumulation of error as embryos move along this developmental trajectory, thereby ensuring that asymmetric division is robust to perturbation. Such modular organization of developmental networks is likely to be a general mechanism to achieve robust developmental outcomes.\nPlanar cell polarity is essential for the architectural patterning of the mammalian biliary tree.\nAuthors: Raab, M.; Christodoulou, E.; Krishnankutty, R.; Younger, N. T.; Gournopanos, K.; Von Kriegsheim, A.; Waddell, S. H.; Boulter, L.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567871\nIn the developing liver, bipotent epithelial progenitor cells known as hepatoblasts undergo lineage segregation to form the two major epithelial cell types, hepatocytes that constitute the bulk of the liver parenchyma and biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) which comprise the bile duct, a complex tubular network which is critical for normal liver function. Notch and TGF{beta} signalling promote the formation of a sheet of biliary epithelial cells, the ductal plate that organises into discontinuous tubular structures. How these structures elongate and connect to form a continuous duct remains undefined. Here, we show that the planar cell polarity protein, VANGL2 is expressed late in intrahepatic bile duct development and patterns the formation of cell-cell contacts between biliary cells. The patterning of these cell contacts regulates the normal polarisation of the actin cytoskeleton within biliary cells and loss of Vangl2-function results in the abnormal distribution of cortical actin remodelling resulting in the failure of bile duct formation. Planar cell polarity is a critical step in the post-specification sculpture of the bile duct and is essential for establishing normal tissue architecture.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)&#43;, substance P&#43;, Trpv1&#43;, and Piezo2&#43;, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2&#43; sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5&#39; UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5&#39; UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5&#39; UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5&#39; UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5&#39; UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5&#39; UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5&#39; UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5&#39; UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gastruloids have recently emerged as an efficient four-dimensional model for studying some aspects of post-implantation embryonic patterning. They undergo gastrulation-like processes leading to the self-organization into highly reproducible biological objects. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this remarkable property. We report that self-organization competence is associated with a cell-specific coordination of a Cadherin switch. We find that N-Cadherin hinders gastruloids morphogenetic competence, for its inactivation leads to the formation of trunk-like structures in absence of extra-cellular matrix analogues. In contrast, E-Cadherin repression by Snai1 is critical for self-organization: Snai1 establishes a cell-specific repressive pace by triggering the repression of a pluripotency-associated transcription program and its chromatin landscape, thus allowing a proper transition from E- to N-Cadherin to occur. Altogether, this work establishes a molecular mechanism that integrates the exit from pluripotency and the pace of cell differentiation, leading to the observed self-organizing potential of gastruloids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a key process in physiological and pathological settings (i.e. development, fibrosis, cancer). EMT is often presented as a linear sequence of events including (i) disassembly of cell-cell junctions, (ii) loss of epithelial polarity and (iii) reorganization of the cytoskeleton leading to basal extrusion from the epithelium. Once out, cells can adopt a migratory phenotype with a front-rear polarity and may additionally become invasive. While this stereotyped sequence can occur, many in vivo observations have challenged this notion. It is now accepted that there are multiple EMT scenarios and that cell populations implementing EMT are often heterogeneous. However, the relative importance of each EMT step towards extrusion is unclear. Similarly, the overall impact of variability and heterogeneity on the efficiency and directionality of cell extrusion has not been assessed. Here we used computational modelling of a pseudostratified epithelium to model multiple EMT-like scenarios. We confronted these in silico data to the EMT occurring during neural crest delamination. Overall, our simulated and biological data point to a key role of nuclear positioning and protrusive activity to generate timely basal extrusion of cells and suggest a non-linear model of EMT allowing multiple scenarios to co-exist.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching  life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cohesin, a chromatin-associated protein complex with four core subunits (Smc1a, Smc3, Rad21 and either Stag1 or 2), has a central role in cell proliferation and gene expression in metazoans. Human developmental disorders termed &#34;cohesinopathies&#34; are characterised by germline mutations in cohesin or its regulators that do not entirely eliminate cohesin function. However, it is not clear if mutations in individual cohesin subunits have independent developmental consequences. Here we show that zebrafish rad21 or stag2 mutants independently influence embryonic tailbud development. Both mutants have altered mesoderm induction, but only homozygous or heterozygous rad21 mutation affects cell cycle gene expression. stag2 mutants have narrower notochords and reduced Wnt signaling in neuromesodermal progenitors as revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing.

Stimulation of Wnt signaling rescues transcription and morphology in stag2, but not rad21 mutants. Our results suggest that mutations altering the quantity versus composition of cohesin have independent developmental consequences, with implications for the understanding and management of cohesinopathies.

TeaserViable zebrafish mutants show that cohesin complex quantity versus composition lead to different transcriptional and developmental outcomes in the early embryo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Probing endogenous protein localization and function in vivo remains challenging due to laborious gene targeting and monofunctional alleles. Here, we develop a multifunctional, universal, and adaptable toolkit based on genetically encoded affinity reagents (GEARs). GEARs use nanobodies and single chain variable fragments (scFv), which recognize small epitopes, enabling fluorescent visualization and selective degradation of protein targets in vivo. Furthermore, we delineate a CRISPR/Cas9-based epitope tagging pipeline to demonstrate its utility for producing knock-in alleles that have broad multifunctionality. We use GEARs to examine the native behaviour of the pioneer transcription factor Nanog and the planar cell polarity protein Vangl2 during early zebrafish development. Together, this toolkit provides a versatile system for probing and perturbing endogenous protein function while circumventing challenges associated with conventional gene targeting and is broadly available to the model organism community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A key challenge in the development of an organism is to maintain robust phenotypic outcomes in the face of perturbation. Yet, how such robust outcomes are encoded by developmental networks remains poorly explored. Here we use the C. elegans zygote as a model to understand sources of developmental robustness during PAR polarity-dependent asymmetric cell division. By quantitatively linking alterations in protein dosage to phenotype in individual embryos, we show that spatial information in the zygote is read out in a highly nonlinear fashion and, as a result, phenotypes are highly canalized against substantial variation in input signals. Specifically, our data point towards an intrinsic robustness of the conserved PAR polarity network that renders polarity axis specification resistant to variations in both the strength of upstream symmetry-breaking cues and PAR protein dosage. At the same time, we find that downstream pathways involved in cell size and fate asymmetry are similarly robust to dosage-dependent changes in the local concentrations of PAR proteins, implying non-trivial complexity in translating PAR signals into pathway outputs. We propose that &#34;quantitative decoupling&#34; of symmetry-breaking, polarity, and asymmetric division modules acts to suppress the accumulation of error as embryos move along this developmental trajectory, thereby ensuring that asymmetric division is robust to perturbation. Such modular organization of developmental networks is likely to be a general mechanism to achieve robust developmental outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the developing liver, bipotent epithelial progenitor cells known as hepatoblasts undergo lineage segregation to form the two major epithelial cell types, hepatocytes that constitute the bulk of the liver parenchyma and biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) which comprise the bile duct, a complex tubular network which is critical for normal liver function. Notch and TGF{beta} signalling promote the formation of a sheet of biliary epithelial cells, the ductal plate that organises into discontinuous tubular structures. How these structures elongate and connect to form a continuous duct remains undefined. Here, we show that the planar cell polarity protein, VANGL2 is expressed late in intrahepatic bile duct development and patterns the formation of cell-cell contacts between biliary cells. The patterning of these cell contacts regulates the normal polarisation of the actin cytoskeleton within biliary cells and loss of Vangl2-function results in the abnormal distribution of cortical actin remodelling resulting in the failure of bile duct formation. Planar cell polarity is a critical step in the post-specification sculpture of the bile duct and is essential for establishing normal tissue architecture.</p>
