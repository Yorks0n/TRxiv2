H.\nScore: 1271.3, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.14.544922\nOur ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.\nTransgene directed induction of a stem cell-derived human embryo model\nAuthors: Weatherbee, B. A. T.; Gantner, C. W.; Daza, R. M.; Hamazaki, N.; Iwamoto-Stohl, L. K.; Shendure, J.; Zernicka-Goetz, M.\nScore: 738.5, Published: 2023-06-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545082\nThe human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus, yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryo in vivo. Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.\nDissecting peri-implantation development using cultured human embryos and embryo-like assembloids\nAuthors: Ai, Z.; Niu, B.; Yin, Y.; Xiang, L.; Shi, G.; Duan, K.; Wang, S.; Hu, Y.; Zhang, C.; Zhang, C.; Rong, L.; Kong, R.; Chen, T.; Guo, Y.; Liu, W.; Li, N.; Zhao, S.; Zhu, X.; Mai, X.; Li, Y.; Wu, Z.; Zheng, Y.; Fu, J.; Ji, W.; Li, T.\nScore: 784.0, Published: 2023-06-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.15.545180\nStudies of cultured embryos have provided insights into human peri-implantation development. However, detailed knowledge of peri-implantation lineage developments as well as underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using 3D-cultured human embryos, herein we report a complete cell atlas of the early post-implantation lineages and decipher cellular composition and gene signatures of the epiblast and hypoblast derivatives. In addition, we develop an embryo-like assembloid (E-assembloid) by assembling naive hESCs and extraembryonic cells. Using human embryos and E-assembloids, we reveal that WNT, BMP and Nodal signaling synergistically, but functionally differently, orchestrate human peri-implantation lineage development. Specially, we dissect mechanisms underlying extraembryonic mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm specifications. Finally, an improved E-assembloid is developed to recapitulate the epiblast and hypoblast developments and tissue architectures in the pre-gastrulation human embryo. Our findings provide insights of the human peri-implantation development, and the E-assembloid offers a useful model to disentangle cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that drive human embryogenesis.\nPrimordial germ cell DNA demethylation and development require DNA translesion synthesis.\nAuthors: Shah, P.; Hill, R. J.; Clark, S.; Dion, C.; Abakir, A.; Arends, M.; Leitch, H.; Reik, W.; Crossan, G.\nScore: 23.1, Published: 2023-07-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547775\nMutations in DNA damage response (DDR) factors are associated with human infertility, which affects up to 15% of the population. It remains unclear if the role of DDR is solely in meiosis. One pathway implicated in human fertility is DNA translesion synthesis (TLS), which allows replication impediments to be bypassed. We find that TLS is essential for pre-meiotic germ cell development in the embryo. Loss of the central TLS component, REV1, significantly inhibits the induction of human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs). This is recapitulated in mice, where deficiencies in TLS initiation (Rev1-/- or PcnaK164R/K164R) or extension (Rev7-/-) result in a \u003e150-fold reduction in the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and complete sterility. In contrast, the absence of TLS does not impact the growth, function, or homeostasis of somatic tissues. Surprisingly, we find a complete failure in both activation of the germ cell transcriptional program and in DNA demethylation, a critical step in germline epigenetic reprogramming. Our findings show that for normal fertility, DNA repair is required not only for meiotic recombination but for progression through the earliest stages of germ cell development in mammals.\nTranscriptional clusters follow a conserved condensation-dispersal sequence during stem cell differentiation\nAuthors: Klingberg, T.; Wachter, I.; Pancholi, A.; Gohar, Y.; Kumar, P.; Sobucki, M.; Kämmer, E.; Eroglu-Kayikci, S.; Erhardt, S.; Ferrai, C.; Zaburdaev, V.; Hilbert, L.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547621\nSpatiotemporal organization of transcription is essential for organism development. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In stem cells, Pol II forms prominent clusters, which gradually disappear during differentiation, such that only smaller clusters remain. Here, we ask whether the formation and loss of large Pol II clusters is a stereotypical process explicable by changes in the Pol II transcriptional state during differentiation. We assess clusters by super-resolution microscopy in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, sperm precursor formation in fruit flies, and germ layer induction in zebrafish. In all cases, Pol II clusters first become larger and rounder, then unfold, and finally disperse into small clusters. These shape changes are accompanied by initial increase in recruited Pol II, subsequent transition into transcript elongation, and finally reduction of active enhancers. We reproduce these observations using a biophysical surface condensation model, where enhancers support Pol II cluster formation, and transcriptional activity unfolds clusters. Our work indicates that changes in enhancer marks and transcriptional activity during differentiation define a stereotyped trajectory through a generally applicable space of cluster shapes.

However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered \"immortal\" due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.\nMesenchymal Vangl facilitates airway elongation and widening independently of the planar cell polarity complex\nAuthors: Paramore, S. V.; Goodwin, K.; Devenport, D.; Nelson, C. M.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547543\nA hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.\nA cytokinetic ring-driven cell rotation achieves Hertwig's rule in early development\nAuthors: Middelkoop, T. C.; Neipel, J.; Cornell, C. E.; Naumann, R.; Pimpale, L. G.; Julicher, F.; Grill, S. W.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546115\nCells tend to divide along the direction in which they are longest, as famously stated by Oscar Hertwig in 1884 in his long axis rule1,2. The orientation of the mitotic spindle determines the cell division axis3, and Hertwigs long axis rule is usually ensured by forces stemming from microtubules4. Pulling on the spindle from the cell cortex can give rise to unstable behaviors5,6, and we here set out to understand how Hertwigs long axis rule is realized in early embryonic divisions where cortical pulling forces are prevalent. We focus on early C. elegans development, where we compressed embryos to reveal that cortical pulling forces favor an alignment of the spindle with the cells short axis. Strikingly, we find that this misalignment is corrected by an actomyosin-based mechanism that rotates the entire cell, including the mitotic spindle. We uncover that myosin-driven contractility in the cytokinetic ring generates inward forces that align it with the short axis, and thereby the spindle with the long axis. A theoretical model together with experiments using slightly compressed mouse zygotes suggest that a constricting cytokinetic ring can ensure Hertwigs long axis rule in cells that are free to rotate inside a confining structure, thereby generalizing the underlying principle.\nModelling Human Post-Implantation Development via Extra-Embryonic Niche Engineering\nAuthors: Hislop, J.

Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons. Additionally, human stem cell models of early post-implantation development with both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue morphogenesis are lacking. Here, we present iDiscoid, produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells via an engineered synthetic gene circuit. iDiscoids exhibit reciprocal co-development of human embryonic tissue and engineered extra-embryonic niche in a model of human post-implantation. They exhibit unanticipated self-organization and tissue boundary formation that recapitulates yolk sac-like tissue specification with extra-embryonic mesoderm and hematopoietic characteristics, the formation of bilaminar disc-like embryonic morphology, the development of an amniotic-like cavity, and acquisition of an anterior-like hypoblast pole and posterior-like axis. iDiscoids offer an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human early post-implantation development. Thus, they have the potential to provide a tractable human model for drug testing, developmental toxicology, and disease modeling.\nDistinct features of the regenerating heart uncovered through comparative single-cell profiling\nAuthors: Carey, C. M.; Hollins, H. L.; Schmid, A. V.; Gagnon, J. A.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-07-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.04.547574\nAdult humans respond to heart injury by forming a permanent scar, yet other vertebrates are capable of robust and complete cardiac regeneration. Despite progress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish and amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating vertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features truly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared cardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share similar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative capability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-resolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell types across both species. With this approach, we identified several key features that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating medaka ventricle. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell recruitment and a distinct pro-inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes, and an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In addition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and retinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we identified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack embryonic-like primordial layer cardiomyocytes, and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene program shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable variation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in zebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the hidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these seemingly similar vertebrates.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Our ability to study early human post-implantation development remains highly limited due to the ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development of the human embryo after implantation. Despite the great progress made on human gastruloids, axioloids and in vitro cultured blastoids, such elegant models do not constitute an integrated Stem cell-derived Embryo Models (SEMs) that includes all the key extra-embryonic tissues of the early post-implantation human conceptus (e.g., hypoblast, yolk-sac, trophoblasts, amnion, and extraembryonic mesoderm), and thus, do not recapitulate post-implantation epiblast development within the context of these extra-embryonic compartments. Mouse naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have recently been shown to give rise to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cells capable of self-assembling into post-gastrulation mouse SEMs, while bypassing the blastocyst-like stage, and eventually initiating organogenesis ex utero. Here, we implement critical adaptations to extend these finding to humans, while using only genetically unmodified human naive PSCs, thus circumventing the need for ectopic expression of lineage promoting transgenes. Such integrated human SEMs recapitulate the organization of all known compartments of early post-implantation stage human embryos, including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers. The organized human SEMs recapitulate key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf, Carnegie stage 6a), such as bilaminar disk formation, epiblast lumenogenesis, amniogenesis, anterior-posterior symmetry breaking, PGC specification, primary and secondary yolk sac formation, and extra-embryonic mesoderm expansion that defines a chorionic cavity and a connective stalk. This new platform constitutes a tractable stem cell-based model for experimentally interrogating previously inaccessible windows of human peri- and early post-implantation development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human embryo undergoes morphogenetic transformations following implantation into the uterus, yet our knowledge of this crucial stage is limited by the inability to observe the embryo in vivo. Stem cell-derived models of the embryo are important tools to interrogate developmental events and tissue-tissue crosstalk during these stages1. Here, we establish a human post-implantation embryo model comprised of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. We combine two types of extraembryonic-like cells generated by transcription factor overexpression with wildtype embryonic stem cells and promote their self-organization into structures that mimic aspects of the post-implantation human embryo. These self-organized aggregates contain a pluripotent epiblast-like domain surrounded by hypoblast-and trophoblast-like tissues. We demonstrate that these inducible human embryoids robustly generate several cell types, including amnion, extraembryonic mesenchyme, and primordial germ cell-like cells in response to BMP signaling. This model also allowed us to identify an inhibitory role for SOX17 in the specification of anterior hypoblast-like cells2. Modulation of the subpopulations in the hypoblast-like compartment demonstrated that extraembryonic-like cells impact epiblast-like domain differentiation, highlighting functional tissue-tissue crosstalk. In conclusion, we present a modular, tractable, integrated3 model of the human embryo that will allow us to probe key questions of human post-implantation development, a critical window when significant numbers of pregnancies fail.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies of cultured embryos have provided insights into human peri-implantation development. However, detailed knowledge of peri-implantation lineage developments as well as underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using 3D-cultured human embryos, herein we report a complete cell atlas of the early post-implantation lineages and decipher cellular composition and gene signatures of the epiblast and hypoblast derivatives. In addition, we develop an embryo-like assembloid (E-assembloid) by assembling naive hESCs and extraembryonic cells. Using human embryos and E-assembloids, we reveal that WNT, BMP and Nodal signaling synergistically, but functionally differently, orchestrate human peri-implantation lineage development. Specially, we dissect mechanisms underlying extraembryonic mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm specifications. Finally, an improved E-assembloid is developed to recapitulate the epiblast and hypoblast developments and tissue architectures in the pre-gastrulation human embryo. Our findings provide insights of the human peri-implantation development, and the E-assembloid offers a useful model to disentangle cellular behaviors and signaling interactions that drive human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) factors are associated with human infertility, which affects up to 15% of the population. It remains unclear if the role of DDR is solely in meiosis. One pathway implicated in human fertility is DNA translesion synthesis (TLS), which allows replication impediments to be bypassed. We find that TLS is essential for pre-meiotic germ cell development in the embryo. Loss of the central TLS component, REV1, significantly inhibits the induction of human PGC-like cells (hPGCLCs). This is recapitulated in mice, where deficiencies in TLS initiation (Rev1-/- or PcnaK164R/K164R) or extension (Rev7-/-) result in a &gt;150-fold reduction in the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and complete sterility. In contrast, the absence of TLS does not impact the growth, function, or homeostasis of somatic tissues. Surprisingly, we find a complete failure in both activation of the germ cell transcriptional program and in DNA demethylation, a critical step in germline epigenetic reprogramming. Our findings show that for normal fertility, DNA repair is required not only for meiotic recombination but for progression through the earliest stages of germ cell development in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spatiotemporal organization of transcription is essential for organism development. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In stem cells, Pol II forms prominent clusters, which gradually disappear during differentiation, such that only smaller clusters remain. Here, we ask whether the formation and loss of large Pol II clusters is a stereotypical process explicable by changes in the Pol II transcriptional state during differentiation. We assess clusters by super-resolution microscopy in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, sperm precursor formation in fruit flies, and germ layer induction in zebrafish. In all cases, Pol II clusters first become larger and rounder, then unfold, and finally disperse into small clusters. These shape changes are accompanied by initial increase in recruited Pol II, subsequent transition into transcript elongation, and finally reduction of active enhancers. We reproduce these observations using a biophysical surface condensation model, where enhancers support Pol II cluster formation, and transcriptional activity unfolds clusters. Our work indicates that changes in enhancer marks and transcriptional activity during differentiation define a stereotyped trajectory through a generally applicable space of cluster shapes.

        <p class="abstract">An ability to delay aging--or to reverse the negative effects of aging--could prevent age-related disease and greatly enhance quality of life in old age. However, whether it is possible to globally reverse the physiological effects of aging in order to extend healthspan is unknown. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been considered &#34;immortal&#34; due to its exceptional tissue regeneration capabilities. Here, we report that a sexually reproducing lineage of S. mediterranea exhibits age-associated physiological decline 12 months after birth. Age-associated changes include alterations in sensory organs, loss of neurons and muscle, loss of fertility, and impaired motility, but no reduction in stem cells at the age of 3 years. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing young and old planarian cells, furthermore revealed cell-type-specific changes in transcription as well as changes in classical aging pathways (e.g., insulin signaling). Remarkably, amputation followed by regeneration of lost tissues led to a global reversal of these age-associated changes. Older individuals that underwent regeneration showed restored youthful patterns of gene expression, stem cell states, tissue composition and rejuvenation of whole-animal physiology. Our work reveals a naturally evolved solution to age reversal in planaria that may provide insights into anti-aging strategies in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cells tend to divide along the direction in which they are longest, as famously stated by Oscar Hertwig in 1884 in his  long axis rule1,2. The orientation of the mitotic spindle determines the cell division axis3, and Hertwigs long axis rule is usually ensured by forces stemming from microtubules4. Pulling on the spindle from the cell cortex can give rise to unstable behaviors5,6, and we here set out to understand how Hertwigs long axis rule is realized in early embryonic divisions where cortical pulling forces are prevalent. We focus on early C. elegans development, where we compressed embryos to reveal that cortical pulling forces favor an alignment of the spindle with the cells short axis. Strikingly, we find that this misalignment is corrected by an actomyosin-based mechanism that rotates the entire cell, including the mitotic spindle. We uncover that myosin-driven contractility in the cytokinetic ring generates inward forces that align it with the short axis, and thereby the spindle with the long axis. A theoretical model together with experiments using slightly compressed mouse zygotes suggest that a constricting cytokinetic ring can ensure Hertwigs long axis rule in cells that are free to rotate inside a confining structure, thereby generalizing the underlying principle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Implantation of the human embryo commences a critical developmental stage that comprises profound morphogenetic alteration of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, axis formation, and gastrulation events. Our mechanistic knowledge of this window of human life remains limited due to restricted access to in vivo samples for both technical and ethical reasons. Additionally, human stem cell models of early post-implantation development with both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue morphogenesis are lacking. Here, we present iDiscoid, produced from human induced pluripotent stem cells via an engineered synthetic gene circuit. iDiscoids exhibit reciprocal co-development of human embryonic tissue and engineered extra-embryonic niche in a model of human post-implantation. They exhibit unanticipated self-organization and tissue boundary formation that recapitulates yolk sac-like tissue specification with extra-embryonic mesoderm and hematopoietic characteristics, the formation of bilaminar disc-like embryonic morphology, the development of an amniotic-like cavity, and acquisition of an anterior-like hypoblast pole and posterior-like axis. iDiscoids offer an easy-to-use, high-throughput, reproducible, and scalable platform to probe multifaceted aspects of human early post-implantation development. Thus, they have the potential to provide a tractable human model for drug testing, developmental toxicology, and disease modeling.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult humans respond to heart injury by forming a permanent scar, yet other vertebrates are capable of robust and complete cardiac regeneration. Despite progress towards characterizing the mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in fish and amphibians, the large evolutionary gulf between mammals and regenerating vertebrates complicates deciphering which cellular and molecular features truly enable regeneration. To better define these features, we compared cardiac injury responses in zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that share similar heart anatomy and common teleost ancestry but differ in regenerative capability. We used single-cell transcriptional profiling to create a time-resolved comparative cell atlas of injury responses in all major cardiac cell types across both species. With this approach, we identified several key features that distinguish cardiac injury response in the non-regenerating medaka ventricle. By comparing immune responses to injury, we found altered cell recruitment and a distinct pro-inflammatory gene program in medaka leukocytes, and an absence of the injury-induced interferon response seen in zebrafish. In addition, we found a lack of pro-regenerative signals, including nrg1 and retinoic acid, from medaka endothelial and epicardial cells. Finally, we identified alterations in the myocardial structure in medaka, where they lack embryonic-like primordial layer cardiomyocytes, and fail to employ a cardioprotective gene program shared by regenerating vertebrates. Our findings reveal notable variation in injury response across nearly all major cardiac cell types in zebrafish and medaka, demonstrating how evolutionary divergence influences the hidden cellular features underpinning regenerative potential in these seemingly similar vertebrates.</p>
