Here, we establish long-term, live light sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labeled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviors, and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labeling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track Actin, Tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus, and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization, and brain regionalization. Based on imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrixinduced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signaling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the Wnt Ligand Secretion Mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of nontelencephalic brain regions. Altogether, our work provides a new inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics, and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics play a central role during brain regionalization.\nModular control of time and space during vertebrate axis segmentation\nAuthors: Seleit, A.; Brettell, I.; Fitzgerald, T. W.; Vibe, C.; Loosli, F.; Wittbrodt, J.; Naruse, K.; Birney, E.; Aulehla, A.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555457\nHow temporal and spatial control of developmental processes are linked remains a fundamental question. Do underlying mechanisms form a single functional unit or are these dissociable modules? We address this question by studying the periodic process of embryonic axis segmentation, using genetic crosses of inbred medaka fish strains representing two species, Oryzias sakaizumii and latipes. Our analysis revealed correlated interspecies differences with regard to the timing of segmentation, the size of segments and of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), from which segments are periodically formed. We then did interspecies crosses and real-time imaging quantifications, which revealed extensive phenotypic variation in ~600 F2 embryos. Importantly, while the F2 analysis showed correlated changes of PSM and segment size, these spatial measures were not correlated to the timing of segmentation. This shows that the control of time and space of axis segmentation can, in principle, be decoupled. In line with this finding, we identified, using developmental quantitative trait loci (devQTL) mapping, distinct chromosomal regions linked to either the control of segmentation timing or PSM size. We were able to validate the devQTL findings using a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function approach on several candidate genes in vivo. Combined, this study reveals that a developmental constraint mechanism underlies spatial scaling of axis segmentation, while its spatial and temporal control are dissociable modules. Our findings emphasise the need to reveal the selective constraints linking these modules in the natural environment.\nA mechanically regulated liquid-liquid phase separation of the transcriptional regulator Tono instructs muscle development\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Avellaneda, J.; Spletter, M. L.; Lemke, S. B.; Mangeol, P.; Habermann, B. H.; Schnorrer, F.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.555003\nMuscle morphogenesis is a multi-step program, starting with myoblast fusion, followed by myotube-tendon attachment and sarcomere assembly, with subsequent sarcomere maturation, mitochondrial amplification and specialisation. The correct chronological order of these steps requires precise control of the transcriptional regulators and their effectors. How this regulation is achieved during muscle development is not well understood. In a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila, we identified the BTB-zinc finger protein Tono (CG32121) as a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator. tono mutant flight muscles display severe deficits in mitochondria and sarcomere maturation, resulting in uncontrolled contractile forces causing muscle atrophy during development. Tono protein is expressed during sarcomere maturation and localises in distinct condensates in flight muscle nuclei. Interestingly, internal pressure exerted by the maturing sarcomeres deforms the muscle nuclei into elongated shapes and changes the Tono condensates, suggesting that Tono senses the mechanical status of the muscle cells. Indeed, external mechanical pressure on the muscles triggers rapid liquid-liquid phase separation of Tono utilising its BTB domain. Thus, we propose that Tono senses high mechanical pressure to in turn adapt muscle transcription specifically at the sarcomere maturation stage. Consistently, tono mutant muscles display specific defects in a transcriptional switch that represses early muscle differentiation genes and boosts late ones. We hypothesise that a similar mechano-responsive regulation mechanism may control the activity of related BTB-zinc finger proteins that, if mutated, can result in uncontrolled force production in human muscle.\nMorphogen gradients can convey position and time in growing tissues\nAuthors: Vetter, R.; Iber, D.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555133\nDuring development, cells need to make fate decisions according to their position and the developmental timepoint. Morphogen gradients provide positional information, but how timing is controlled has remained elusive. Here, we show that in morphogen gradients with constant decay length, cells experience transient, hump-shaped concentration profiles if the morphogen source expands in parallel with the uniformly growing tissue. This transient signal can convey time. We further show that opposing steady-state morphogen gradients with equal decay length, as found in the vertebrate neural tube, can synchronise cell fate decisions along the entire expanding patterning axis, because the product of the two opposing concentration gradients is constant along it. In case of an increasing amplitude, cells experience a transient hump signal, while in case of constant gradient amplitudes, the concentration product declines continuously as the tissue expands - a hallmark of a depletion timer. Once the tissue reaches a critical size and the concentrations a critical value, a cell fate switch can be triggered. Timers based on morphogen gradients offer a simple mechanism for the simultaneous control of position and time and might apply in many patterning systems, as uniform growth is observed widely in development.\nA single-cell atlas of pig gastrulation as a resource for comparative embryology\nAuthors: Simpson, L.; Strange, A.; Klisch, D.; Kraunsoe, S.; Azami, T.; Goszczynski, D.; Le, T.; Planells, B.; Holmes, N.; Sang, F.; Henson, S.; Loose, M. W.; Nichols, J.; Alberio, R.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555712\nEarly mammalian gastrulations cell-fate decisions are poorly understood due to difficulties obtaining non-rodent embryos. The bilaminar disc of pig embryos mirrors humans, making them a useful proxy for studying gastrulation. Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig gastrulation, revealing cell-fate emergence dynamics, as well as conserved and divergent gene programs governing early porcine, primate, and murine development. We highlight heterochronicity in extraembryonic cell-type development, despite the broad conservation of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. We apply these findings in combination with functional investigations, to outline conserved spatial, molecular, and temporal events during definitive endoderm (DE). We find early FOXA2+/TBXT- embryonic disc cells directly from DE, contrasting later-emerging FOXA2/TBXT+ node/notochord progenitors. Unlike mesoderm, none of these progenitors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DE/Node fate hinges on balanced WNT and hypoblast-derived NODAL, which is extinguished upon DE differentiation. These findings emphasise the interplay between temporal and topological signalling in early fate decisions during gastrulation.\nReversal of Biological Age in Multiple Rat Organs by Young Porcine Plasma Fraction\nAuthors: Horvath, S.; Singh, K.; Raj, K.; Khairnar, S.; Sanghavi, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Zoller, J. A.; Li, C. Z.; Herenu, C. B.; Canatelli-Mallat, M.; Lehmann, M.; Habazin, S.; Vuckovic, F.; Solberg-Woods, L.; Garcia Martinez, A.; Wang, T.; Chiavellini, P.; Levine, A. J.; Chen, H.; Brooke, R. T.; Gordevicius, J.; Lauc, G.; Goya, R. G.; Katcher, H. L.\nScore: 59.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552148\nYoung blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.\nPrimate-expressed EPIREGULIN promotes basal progenitor proliferation in the developing neocortex\nAuthors: Cubillos, P.; Ditzer, N.; Kolodziejczyk, A.; Schwenk, G.; Hoffmann, J.; Schütze, T. M.; Derihaci, R. P.; Birdir, C.; Köllner, J. E. M.; Petzold, A.; Sarov, M.; Martin, U.; Long, K. R.; Wimberger, P.; Albert, M.\nScore: 21.5, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554446\nNeocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.\nInfection with the chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) may distort sex ratio via sex reversal but not sex-dependent mortality in a common Eurasian amphibian\nAuthors: Ujszegi, J.; Ujhegyi, N.; Balogh, E.; Miko, Z.; Kasler, A.; Hettyey, A.; Bokony, V.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-08-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.25.554788\nOne of the major factors driving the currently ongoing biodiversity crisis is the anthropogenic spread of infectious diseases. Diseases can have conspicuous consequences, such as mass mortality events, but may also exert covert but similarly severe effects, such as sex ratio distortion via sex-biased mortality or sex reversal. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is among the most important threats to amphibian biodiversity. Yet, whether Bd infection can skew sex ratios in amphibians is currently unknown, although such a hidden effect may cause the already dwindling amphibian populations to collapse. To investigate this possibility, we collected common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles from a natural habitat in Hungary, and continuously treated them until metamorphosis with sterile Bd culture medium (control), or a liquid culture of a Hungarian or a Spanish Bd isolate. Three months after metamorphosis we dissected the individuals and diagnosed their phenotypic and genetic sex. Bd prevalence was high in animals that died during the experiment but was almost zero at sexing. Survival was generally low in the control group, but it was further lowered by the Bd treatments. We did not observe sex-dependent mortality in either treatment. However, treatment with the Spanish Bd isolate significantly increased the frequency of sex reversal: 3 out of 9 genetic females developed into phenotypic males. Based on our results, Bd infection may have the potential to affect sex ratio in common toads through female-to-male sex reversal, but future research is needed to ascertain the generality of these findings.\nDynamics of chromatin accessibility during human first-trimester neurodevelopment\nAuthors: Mannens, C. C. A.; Hu, L.; Lonnerberg, P.; Schipper, M.; Reagor, C.; Li, X.; He, X.; Barker, R. A.; Sundstrom, E.; Posthuma, D.; Linnarsson, S.\nScore: 32.9, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553878\nThe human brain is capable of highly complex functions that develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, expressed transcription factors and changes in chromatin accessibility. While extensive datasets exist describing gene expression across the developing brain with single-cell resolution, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain. Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million nuclei and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.\nFoxg1 bimodally tunes L1-mRNA and -DNA dynamics in the developing murine neocortex\nAuthors: Liuzzi, G.; Mallamaci, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552831\nFoxg1 masters telencephalic development via a pleiotropic control of its articulation. L1 is a large retrotransposon family expressed within CNS and suggested to contribute to its genomic plasticity. Foxg1 represses gene transcription, and L1 elements share putative Foxg1 binding motifs, suggesting the former might limit telencephalic expression (and activity) of the latter. We tested such prediction, in vivo as well as in engineered primary neural cultures, by loss- and gain-of-function approaches. We showed that Foxg1-dependent, transcriptional L1 repression specifically occurs in neopallial neuronogenic progenitors and post-mitotic neurons, where it is supported by specific changes in the L1 epigenetic landscape. Unexpectedly, we also found that Foxg1 physically interacts with L1-mRNA and positively impacts on neonatal neopallium L1-DNA content, antagonizing the retrotranscription-suppressing activity exerted by Mov10 and Ddx39a helicases. To our knowledge, Foxg1 is the first CNS patterning gene acting as a bimodal retrotransposon modulator, limiting and promoting L1 transcription and amplification, respectively, within a specific domain of the developing mouse brain.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development, and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems. Here, we establish long-term, live light sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labeled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviors, and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labeling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track Actin, Tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus, and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization, and brain regionalization. Based on imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrixinduced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signaling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the Wnt Ligand Secretion Mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of nontelencephalic brain regions. Altogether, our work provides a new inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics, and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics play a central role during brain regionalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How temporal and spatial control of developmental processes are linked remains a fundamental question. Do underlying mechanisms form a single functional unit or are these dissociable modules? We address this question by studying the periodic process of embryonic axis segmentation, using genetic crosses of inbred medaka fish strains representing two species, Oryzias sakaizumii and latipes. Our analysis revealed correlated interspecies differences with regard to the timing of segmentation, the size of segments and of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), from which segments are periodically formed. We then did interspecies crosses and real-time imaging quantifications, which revealed extensive phenotypic variation in ~600 F2 embryos. Importantly, while the F2 analysis showed correlated changes of PSM and segment size, these spatial measures were not correlated to the timing of segmentation. This shows that the control of time and space of axis segmentation can, in principle, be decoupled. In line with this finding, we identified, using developmental quantitative trait loci (devQTL) mapping, distinct chromosomal regions linked to either the control of segmentation timing or PSM size. We were able to validate the devQTL findings using a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function approach on several candidate genes in vivo. Combined, this study reveals that a developmental constraint mechanism underlies spatial scaling of axis segmentation, while its spatial and temporal control are dissociable modules. Our findings emphasise the need to reveal the selective constraints linking these modules in the natural environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscle morphogenesis is a multi-step program, starting with myoblast fusion, followed by myotube-tendon attachment and sarcomere assembly, with subsequent sarcomere maturation, mitochondrial amplification and specialisation. The correct chronological order of these steps requires precise control of the transcriptional regulators and their effectors. How this regulation is achieved during muscle development is not well understood. In a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila, we identified the BTB-zinc finger protein Tono (CG32121) as a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator. tono mutant flight muscles display severe deficits in mitochondria and sarcomere maturation, resulting in uncontrolled contractile forces causing muscle atrophy during development. Tono protein is expressed during sarcomere maturation and localises in distinct condensates in flight muscle nuclei. Interestingly, internal pressure exerted by the maturing sarcomeres deforms the muscle nuclei into elongated shapes and changes the Tono condensates, suggesting that Tono senses the mechanical status of the muscle cells. Indeed, external mechanical pressure on the muscles triggers rapid liquid-liquid phase separation of Tono utilising its BTB domain. Thus, we propose that Tono senses high mechanical pressure to in turn adapt muscle transcription specifically at the sarcomere maturation stage. Consistently, tono mutant muscles display specific defects in a transcriptional switch that represses early muscle differentiation genes and boosts late ones. We hypothesise that a similar mechano-responsive regulation mechanism may control the activity of related BTB-zinc finger proteins that, if mutated, can result in uncontrolled force production in human muscle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During development, cells need to make fate decisions according to their position and the developmental timepoint. Morphogen gradients provide positional information, but how timing is controlled has remained elusive. Here, we show that in morphogen gradients with constant decay length, cells experience transient, hump-shaped concentration profiles if the morphogen source expands in parallel with the uniformly growing tissue. This transient signal can convey time. We further show that opposing steady-state morphogen gradients with equal decay length, as found in the vertebrate neural tube, can synchronise cell fate decisions along the entire expanding patterning axis, because the product of the two opposing concentration gradients is constant along it. In case of an increasing amplitude, cells experience a transient hump signal, while in case of constant gradient amplitudes, the concentration product declines continuously as the tissue expands - a hallmark of a depletion timer. Once the tissue reaches a critical size and the concentrations a critical value, a cell fate switch can be triggered. Timers based on morphogen gradients offer a simple mechanism for the simultaneous control of position and time and might apply in many patterning systems, as uniform growth is observed widely in development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early mammalian gastrulations cell-fate decisions are poorly understood due to difficulties obtaining non-rodent embryos. The bilaminar disc of pig embryos mirrors humans, making them a useful proxy for studying gastrulation. Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig gastrulation, revealing cell-fate emergence dynamics, as well as conserved and divergent gene programs governing early porcine, primate, and murine development. We highlight heterochronicity in extraembryonic cell-type development, despite the broad conservation of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. We apply these findings in combination with functional investigations, to outline conserved spatial, molecular, and temporal events during definitive endoderm (DE). We find early FOXA2&#43;/TBXT- embryonic disc cells directly from DE, contrasting later-emerging FOXA2/TBXT&#43; node/notochord progenitors. Unlike mesoderm, none of these progenitors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DE/Node fate hinges on balanced WNT and hypoblast-derived NODAL, which is extinguished upon DE differentiation. These findings emphasise the interplay between temporal and topological signalling in early fate decisions during gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.</p>

        <p class="abstract">One of the major factors driving the currently ongoing biodiversity crisis is the anthropogenic spread of infectious diseases. Diseases can have conspicuous consequences, such as mass mortality events, but may also exert covert but similarly severe effects, such as sex ratio distortion via sex-biased mortality or sex reversal. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is among the most important threats to amphibian biodiversity. Yet, whether Bd infection can skew sex ratios in amphibians is currently unknown, although such a hidden effect may cause the already dwindling amphibian populations to collapse. To investigate this possibility, we collected common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles from a natural habitat in Hungary, and continuously treated them until metamorphosis with sterile Bd culture medium (control), or a liquid culture of a Hungarian or a Spanish Bd isolate. Three months after metamorphosis we dissected the individuals and diagnosed their phenotypic and genetic sex. Bd prevalence was high in animals that died during the experiment but was almost zero at sexing. Survival was generally low in the control group, but it was further lowered by the Bd treatments. We did not observe sex-dependent mortality in either treatment. However, treatment with the Spanish Bd isolate significantly increased the frequency of sex reversal: 3 out of 9 genetic females developed into phenotypic males. Based on our results, Bd infection may have the potential to affect sex ratio in common toads through female-to-male sex reversal, but future research is needed to ascertain the generality of these findings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human brain is capable of highly complex functions that develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, expressed transcription factors and changes in chromatin accessibility. While extensive datasets exist describing gene expression across the developing brain with single-cell resolution, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain. Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million nuclei and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Foxg1 masters telencephalic development via a pleiotropic control of its articulation. L1 is a large retrotransposon family expressed within CNS and suggested to contribute to its genomic plasticity. Foxg1 represses gene transcription, and L1 elements share putative Foxg1 binding motifs, suggesting the former might limit telencephalic expression (and activity) of the latter. We tested such prediction, in vivo as well as in engineered primary neural cultures, by loss- and gain-of-function approaches. We showed that Foxg1-dependent, transcriptional L1 repression specifically occurs in neopallial neuronogenic progenitors and post-mitotic neurons, where it is supported by specific changes in the L1 epigenetic landscape. Unexpectedly, we also found that Foxg1 physically interacts with L1-mRNA and positively impacts on neonatal neopallium L1-DNA content, antagonizing the retrotranscription-suppressing activity exerted by Mov10 and Ddx39a helicases. To our knowledge, Foxg1 is the first CNS patterning gene acting as a bimodal retrotransposon modulator, limiting and promoting L1 transcription and amplification, respectively, within a specific domain of the developing mouse brain.</p>
