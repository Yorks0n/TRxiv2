Fishes and amphibians possess two somatosensory systems in the trunk: the primary somatosensory system, formed by the Rohon-Beard neurons, and the secondary somatosensory system, formed by the neural crest cell-derived neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.\nA non-canonical role of somatic CYCLIN D/CYD-1 in oogenesis and reproductive aging, dependent on the FOXO/DAF-16 activation state\nAuthors: Rautela, U.; Sarkar, G. C.; Chaudhary, A.; Chatterjee, D.; Rosh, M.; Arimbasseri, A. G.; Mukhopadhyay, A.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.09.570929\nFor the optimal survival of a species, an organism coordinates its reproductive decisions with the nutrient availability of its niche. Thus, nutrient-sensing pathways like insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS) play an important role in modulating cell division, oogenesis, and reproductive aging. Lowering of the IIS leads to the activation of the downstream FOXO transcription factor (TF) DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans which promotes oocyte quality and delays reproductive aging. However, less is known about how the IIS axis responds to changes in cell cycle proteins, particularly in the somatic tissues. Here, we show a new aspect of the regulation of the germline by this nutrient-sensing axis. First, we show that the canonical G1-S cyclin, cyclin D/cyd-1, regulates reproductive aging from the uterine tissue of wild-type worms. Then, we show that knocking down cyd-1 in the uterine tissue of an IIS receptor mutant arrests oogenesis at the pachytene stage of meiosis-1 in a FOXO/DAF-16-dependent manner. We find that activated FOXO/DAF-16 destroys the somatic gonad tissues like the sheath cells, and transcriptionally prevents the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch to orchestrate this arrest. Deleting FOXO/DAF-16 releases the arrest and restores the somatic gonad but leads to the production of poor-quality oocytes. Together, our study reveals the unrecognized cell non-autonomous interaction of CYD-1 and FOXO/DAF-16 in reproductive aging and the regulation of oogenesis.\nTemporal recording of mammalian development and precancer\nAuthors: Islam, M.; Yang, Y.; Simmons, A.

J.; Liu, Q.; Zafar, H.; Kalhor, R.; Church, G. M.; Shrubsole, M. J.; Coffey, R. J.; Lau, K.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572260\nKey to understanding many biological phenomena is knowing the temporal ordering of cellular events, which often require continuous direct observations [1, 2]. An alternative solution involves the utilization of irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using NSC-seq, a newly designed and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, while incorporating assigned cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development and identified new intestinal epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas and single-cell multi-omic profiling of human precancers as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), including 116 scRNA-seq datasets and clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers, revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Thus, our multimodal framework augments existing single-cell analyses and lays the foundation for in vivo multimodal recording, enabling the tracking of lineage and temporal events during development and tumorigenesis.\nThe Developmental Transcription Factor TBX3 Physically Engages with the Wnt/β-catenin Transcriptional Complex in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells to Regulate Metastasis Genes\nAuthors: Jauregi-Miguel, A.; Soderholm, S.; Weiss, T. L.; Nordin, A.; Ghezzi, V.; Bruetsch, S. M.; Pagella, P.; van de Grift, Y.; Zambanini, G.; Ulisse, J.; Mattias, A.; Deviatiiarov, R.; Faustini, E.; Moparthi, L.; Lottersberger, F.; Koch, S.; Moor, A. E.; Sun, X.-F.; von Castelmur, E.; Sheng, G.; Cantu', C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571901\nWnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear {beta}-catenin. Furthermore, neoplasia of the colorectal epithelium begins with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Yet, little is known about how {beta}-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. We have previously identified the developmental transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is present and functionally active in human colorectal cancers. TBX3 genomic binding pattern suggests a regulatory role that broadly coincides with that of Wnt/{beta}-catenin. Moreover, proteomics proximity labelling indicated that, during Wnt pathway activation, TBX3 is vicinal to several protein partners, including the transcription factors TCF/LEF and chromatin remodeling complexes which are usually found at Wnt responsive elements. Sequence and structure analysis revealed that TBX3 possesses an exposed Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif predicted by AlphaFold2 Multimer to mediate direct interactions with several Wnt-activated TBX3 partners. Deletion of NPF abrogates TBX3 proximity to these partners and its ability to modulate Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin in colorectal cancer, and its mechanism of action exposes a novel druggable protein interaction surface.\nNiche signalling regulates eIF3d1 phosphorylation to promote distinct modes of translation initiation in stem and differentiating cells\nAuthors: Wang, R.; Roiuk, M.; Storer, F. T.; Teleman, A. A.; Amoyel, M.\nScore: 2.9, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571284\nStem cells have the unique ability among adult cells to give rise to cells of different identities. To do so, they must change gene expression in response to environmental signals. Much work has focused on how transcription is regulated to achieve these changes, however in many cell types, transcripts and proteins correlate poorly, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation is important. To assess how translational control can influence stem cell fate, we use the Drosophila testis as a model. The testis niche secretes a ligand to activate the JAK/STAT pathway in two stem cell populations, germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). We find that global translation rates are high in CySCs and decrease during differentiation, and that JAK/STAT signalling regulates translation. To determine how translation was regulated, we knocked down translation initiation factors and found that the cap binding complex, eIF4F, is dispensable in differentiating cells, but is specifically required in CySCs for self-renewal, acting downstream of JAK/STAT activity. Moreover, we identify eIF3d1 as a key regulator of CySC fate, and show that its phosphorylation is critical to maintain CySC self-renewal. We further show that Casein Kinase II, which controls eIF3d1 phosphorylation, is sufficient to restore CySC function in the absence of JAK/STAT. We propose a model in which niche signals regulate a specific translation programme in which only some mRNAs are translated, through regulation of eIF3d phosphorylation. The mechanism we identify allows stem cells to switch between modes of translation, adding a layer of regulation on top of transcription and providing cells with the ability to rapidly change gene expression upon receiving external stimuli.\nAnp32e protects against accumulation of H2A.Z at Sox motif containing promoters during zebrafish gastrulation\nAuthors: Halblander, F. H.; Meng, F. W.; Murphy, P. J.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572196\nEpigenetic regulation of chromatin states is crucial for proper gene expression programs and progression during development, but precise mechanisms by which epigenetic factors influence differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we find that the histone variant H2A.Z accumulates at Sox motif-containing promoters during zebrafish gastrulation while neighboring genes become transcriptionally active. These changes coincide with reduced expression of anp32e, the H2A.Z histone removal chaperone, suggesting that loss of Anp32e may lead to increases in H2A.Z during differentiation. Remarkably, genetic removal of Anp32e in embryos leads to H2A.Z accumulation prior to gastrulation, and precocious developmental transcription of Sox motif associated genes. Altogether, our results provide compelling evidence for a mechanism in which Anp32e restricts H2A.Z accumulation at Sox motif-containing promoters, and subsequent down-regulation of Anp32e enables temporal up-regulation of Sox motif associated genes.\nSingle-cell RNAseq reveals the pro-regenerative role of senescent FAPs in muscle regeneration\nAuthors: Chen, C.; Saclier, M.; Chantrel, J.; Mella, S.; Chiche, A.; Li, H.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571148\nMuscle regeneration is associated with transient induction of cellular senescence. However, the role of senescence in muscle regeneration of young mice remains unclear. Using a mouse model deficient in both Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, we find that a marked reduction in senescent cells correlates with delayed muscle regeneration. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a heterogeneous senescence program composing of multiple cell types. Notably, senescent fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) upregulate Mcl-1 to acquire apoptosis resistance. Moreover, removing senescent FAPs using a Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 impairs muscle regeneration. Furthermore, we find that senescent FAPs promotes myogenic differentiation in a paracrine manner. Hence, these results highlight the beneficial role of senescent stromal cells in supporting muscle regeneration.\nHofbauer cells and fetal brain microglia share transcriptional profiles and responses to maternal diet-induced obesity\nAuthors: Batorsky, R.; Ceasrine, A.

G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.571680\nMaternal immune activation is associated with adverse offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes, many mediated by in utero microglial programming. As microglia remain inaccessible throughout development, identification of noninvasive biomarkers reflecting fetal brain microglial programming could permit screening and intervention. We used lineage tracing to demonstrate the shared ontogeny between fetal brain macrophages (microglia) and fetal placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells) in a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity, and single-cell RNA-seq to demonstrate shared transcriptional programs. Comparison with human datasets demonstrated conservation of placental resident macrophage signatures between mice and humans. Single-cell RNA-seq identified common alterations in fetal microglial and Hofbauer cell gene expression induced by maternal obesity, as well as sex differences in these alterations. We propose that Hofbauer cells, which are easily accessible at birth, provide novel insights into fetal brain microglial programs, and may facilitate the early identification of offspring vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders in the setting of maternal exposures.\nMicroplastics are detected in bull and dog sperm and polystyrene microparticles impair sperm fertilization\nAuthors: Grechi, N.; Ferronato, G.; Devkota, S.; de Almeida Monteiro Melo Ferraz, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571802\nThe alarming increase in global infertility rates has coincided with the pervasive accumulation of microplastics (MPs) resulting from the poor management of plastic waste. This concerning trend is particularly troubling because only 10% of male infertility cases can be attributed to identifiable causes, leaving a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of their underlying factors. To bridge this critical gap, it is important to explore the connection between the accumulation of MPs and the observed decline in male fertility. Here, the presence of microplastics in reproductive fluids from bulls and dogs was assessed and used as baseline concentrations for bull sperm exposure. Bovine epididymal sperm (ES) presented a mean of 72.5 MP particles mL-1 (0.3691 g mL-1) while canine seminal plasma had an average of 35.4 MP particles mL-1 (0.0066 g mL-1). Bovine sperm was exposed to three different concentrations of a mixture of 1.1, 0.5, and 0.3 {micro}m polystyrene (PS) beads: (1) 0.7 g mL-1, blood concentration of PS in cows (bPS); (2) 0.37 g mL-1, concentration of total MPs in ES (esMP); and (3) 0.026 g mL-1, concentration of PS in ES (esPS). All sperm samples incubated with PS exhibited reduced motility compared with the CT at 0.5 h. However, PS exposure did not affect acrosome or induced oxidative stress. When used for in vitro fertilization, the sperm exposed to PS had decreased blastocyst rates, in addition to inducing ROS formation and apoptosis on resulting embryos. By employing realistic exposure concentrations, this research sought to shed light on the comprehensive impact of MPs on bovine sperm and the quality of resulting embryos, providing the first evidence of MPs in bovine and dog sperm and demonstrating the detrimental effect of PS MPs on sperm motility and functionality.

Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The somatosensory system detects peripheral stimuli that are translated into behaviors necessary for survival. Fishes and amphibians possess two somatosensory systems in the trunk: the primary somatosensory system, formed by the Rohon-Beard neurons, and the secondary somatosensory system, formed by the neural crest cell-derived neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For the optimal survival of a species, an organism coordinates its reproductive decisions with the nutrient availability of its niche. Thus, nutrient-sensing pathways like insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS) play an important role in modulating cell division, oogenesis, and reproductive aging. Lowering of the IIS leads to the activation of the downstream FOXO transcription factor (TF) DAF-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans which promotes oocyte quality and delays reproductive aging. However, less is known about how the IIS axis responds to changes in cell cycle proteins, particularly in the somatic tissues. Here, we show a new aspect of the regulation of the germline by this nutrient-sensing axis. First, we show that the canonical G1-S cyclin, cyclin D/cyd-1, regulates reproductive aging from the uterine tissue of wild-type worms. Then, we show that knocking down cyd-1 in the uterine tissue of an IIS receptor mutant arrests oogenesis at the pachytene stage of meiosis-1 in a FOXO/DAF-16-dependent manner. We find that activated FOXO/DAF-16 destroys the somatic gonad tissues like the sheath cells, and transcriptionally prevents the spermatogenesis-to-oogenesis switch to orchestrate this arrest. Deleting FOXO/DAF-16 releases the arrest and restores the somatic gonad but leads to the production of poor-quality oocytes. Together, our study reveals the unrecognized cell non-autonomous interaction of CYD-1 and FOXO/DAF-16 in reproductive aging and the regulation of oogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Key to understanding many biological phenomena is knowing the temporal ordering of cellular events, which often require continuous direct observations [1, 2]. An alternative solution involves the utilization of irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using NSC-seq, a newly designed and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, while incorporating assigned cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development and identified new intestinal epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas and single-cell multi-omic profiling of human precancers as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), including 116 scRNA-seq datasets and clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers, revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Thus, our multimodal framework augments existing single-cell analyses and lays the foundation for in vivo multimodal recording, enabling the tracking of lineage and temporal events during development and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear {beta}-catenin. Furthermore, neoplasia of the colorectal epithelium begins with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Yet, little is known about how {beta}-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. We have previously identified the developmental transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is present and functionally active in human colorectal cancers. TBX3 genomic binding pattern suggests a regulatory role that broadly coincides with that of Wnt/{beta}-catenin. Moreover, proteomics proximity labelling indicated that, during Wnt pathway activation, TBX3 is vicinal to several protein partners, including the transcription factors TCF/LEF and chromatin remodeling complexes which are usually found at Wnt responsive elements. Sequence and structure analysis revealed that TBX3 possesses an exposed Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif predicted by AlphaFold2 Multimer to mediate direct interactions with several Wnt-activated TBX3 partners. Deletion of NPF abrogates TBX3 proximity to these partners and its ability to modulate Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin in colorectal cancer, and its mechanism of action exposes a novel druggable protein interaction surface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem cells have the unique ability among adult cells to give rise to cells of different identities. To do so, they must change gene expression in response to environmental signals. Much work has focused on how transcription is regulated to achieve these changes, however in many cell types, transcripts and proteins correlate poorly, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation is important. To assess how translational control can influence stem cell fate, we use the Drosophila testis as a model. The testis niche secretes a ligand to activate the JAK/STAT pathway in two stem cell populations, germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). We find that global translation rates are high in CySCs and decrease during differentiation, and that JAK/STAT signalling regulates translation. To determine how translation was regulated, we knocked down translation initiation factors and found that the cap binding complex, eIF4F, is dispensable in differentiating cells, but is specifically required in CySCs for self-renewal, acting downstream of JAK/STAT activity. Moreover, we identify eIF3d1 as a key regulator of CySC fate, and show that its phosphorylation is critical to maintain CySC self-renewal. We further show that Casein Kinase II, which controls eIF3d1 phosphorylation, is sufficient to restore CySC function in the absence of JAK/STAT. We propose a model in which niche signals regulate a specific translation programme in which only some mRNAs are translated, through regulation of eIF3d phosphorylation. The mechanism we identify allows stem cells to switch between modes of translation, adding a layer of regulation on top of transcription and providing cells with the ability to rapidly change gene expression upon receiving external stimuli.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epigenetic regulation of chromatin states is crucial for proper gene expression programs and progression during development, but precise mechanisms by which epigenetic factors influence differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we find that the histone variant H2A.Z accumulates at Sox motif-containing promoters during zebrafish gastrulation while neighboring genes become transcriptionally active. These changes coincide with reduced expression of anp32e, the H2A.Z histone removal chaperone, suggesting that loss of Anp32e may lead to increases in H2A.Z during differentiation. Remarkably, genetic removal of Anp32e in embryos leads to H2A.Z accumulation prior to gastrulation, and precocious developmental transcription of Sox motif associated genes. Altogether, our results provide compelling evidence for a mechanism in which Anp32e restricts H2A.Z accumulation at Sox motif-containing promoters, and subsequent down-regulation of Anp32e enables temporal up-regulation of Sox motif associated genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscle regeneration is associated with transient induction of cellular senescence. However, the role of senescence in muscle regeneration of young mice remains unclear. Using a mouse model deficient in both Cdkn1a and Cdkn2a, we find that a marked reduction in senescent cells correlates with delayed muscle regeneration. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a heterogeneous senescence program composing of multiple cell types. Notably, senescent fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) upregulate Mcl-1 to acquire apoptosis resistance. Moreover, removing senescent FAPs using a Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 impairs muscle regeneration. Furthermore, we find that senescent FAPs promotes myogenic differentiation in a paracrine manner. Hence, these results highlight the beneficial role of senescent stromal cells in supporting muscle regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Maternal immune activation is associated with adverse offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes, many mediated by in utero microglial programming. As microglia remain inaccessible throughout development, identification of noninvasive biomarkers reflecting fetal brain microglial programming could permit screening and intervention. We used lineage tracing to demonstrate the shared ontogeny between fetal brain macrophages (microglia) and fetal placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells) in a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity, and single-cell RNA-seq to demonstrate shared transcriptional programs. Comparison with human datasets demonstrated conservation of placental resident macrophage signatures between mice and humans. Single-cell RNA-seq identified common alterations in fetal microglial and Hofbauer cell gene expression induced by maternal obesity, as well as sex differences in these alterations. We propose that Hofbauer cells, which are easily accessible at birth, provide novel insights into fetal brain microglial programs, and may facilitate the early identification of offspring vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders in the setting of maternal exposures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The alarming increase in global infertility rates has coincided with the pervasive accumulation of microplastics (MPs) resulting from the poor management of plastic waste. This concerning trend is particularly troubling because only 10% of male infertility cases can be attributed to identifiable causes, leaving a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of their underlying factors. To bridge this critical gap, it is important to explore the connection between the accumulation of MPs and the observed decline in male fertility. Here, the presence of microplastics in reproductive fluids from bulls and dogs was assessed and used as baseline concentrations for bull sperm exposure. Bovine epididymal sperm (ES) presented a mean of 72.5 MP particles mL-1 (0.3691 g mL-1) while canine seminal plasma had an average of 35.4 MP particles mL-1 (0.0066 g mL-1). Bovine sperm was exposed to three different concentrations of a mixture of 1.1, 0.5, and 0.3 {micro}m polystyrene (PS) beads: (1) 0.7 g mL-1, blood concentration of PS in cows (bPS); (2) 0.37 g mL-1, concentration of total MPs in ES (esMP); and (3) 0.026 g mL-1, concentration of PS in ES (esPS). All sperm samples incubated with PS exhibited reduced motility compared with the CT at 0.5 h. However, PS exposure did not affect acrosome or induced oxidative stress. When used for in vitro fertilization, the sperm exposed to PS had decreased blastocyst rates, in addition to inducing ROS formation and apoptosis on resulting embryos. By employing realistic exposure concentrations, this research sought to shed light on the comprehensive impact of MPs on bovine sperm and the quality of resulting embryos, providing the first evidence of MPs in bovine and dog sperm and demonstrating the detrimental effect of PS MPs on sperm motility and functionality.

        <p class="abstract">Compaction is the first morphogenetic movement of the eutherian mammals and involves a developmentally regulated adhesion process. Previous studies investigated cellular and mechanical aspects of compaction. During mouse and human compaction, cells spread onto each other as a result of a contractility-mediated increase in surface tension pulling at the edges of their cell-cell contacts. However, how compaction may affect the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts remains unknown. Here, we used a dual pipette aspiration assay on cell doublets to quantitatively analyze the mechanical stability of compacting mouse embryos. We measured increased mechanical stability of contacts with rupture forces growing from 40 to 70 nN, which was highly correlated with cell-cell contact expansion. Analyzing the dynamic molecular reorganization of cell-cell contacts, we find minimal recruitment of the cell-cell adhesion molecule Cdh1 (also known as E-cadherin) to contacts but we observe its reorganization into a peripheral adhesive ring. However, this reorganization is not associated with increased effective bond density, contrary to previous reports in other adhesive systems. Using genetics, we reduce the levels of Cdh1 or replace it with a chimeric adhesion molecule composed of the extracellular domain of Cdh1 and the intracellular domain of Cdh2 (also known as N-cadherin). We find that reducing the levels of Cdh1 impairs the mechanical stability of cell-cell contacts due to reduced contact growth, which nevertheless show higher effective bond density than WT contacts of similar size. On the other hand, chimeric adhesion molecules cannot form large or strong contacts indicating that the intracellular domain of Cdh2 is unable to reorganize contacts and/or is mechanically weaker than the one of Cdh1 in mouse embryos. Together, we find that mouse embryo compaction mechanically strengthens cell-cell adhesion via the expansion of Cdh1 adhesive rings that maintain pre-compaction levels of effective bond density.</p>
