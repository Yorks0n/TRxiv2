L.; Farrell, J. A.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573643\nDuring differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system - the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.\nDMSO derives Trophectoderm and Clonal Blastoid from Single Human Pluripotent Stem Cell\nAuthors: Alsolami, S.; Chandrasekaran, A. P.; Jin, Y.; Shakir, I. M.; Zhang, Y.; Ramos-Mandujano, G.; Yuan, B.; Saera-Vila, A.; Izpisua Belm, J. C. o.; Li, M.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573770\nHuman naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) can differentiate into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), a critical step in the generation of the integrated embryo model termed blastoid. The current paradigm of blastoid generation necessitates the aggregation of dozens of nPSCs treated with multiple small molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or genetic modifications to initiate TE differentiation. The presence of complex crosstalk among pathways and cellular heterogeneity in these models complicates mechanistic study and genetic screens. Here, we show that a single small molecule, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potently induces TE differentiation in basal medium without pharmacological and genetic perturbations. DMSO enhances blastoid generation and, more importantly, is sufficient for blastoid generation by itself. DMSO blastoids resemble blastocysts in morphology and lineage composition. DMSO induces blastoid formation through PKC signaling and cell cycle regulation. Lastly, DMSO enables single nPSC-derived clonal blastoids, which could facilitate genetic screens for mechanistic understanding of human embryogenesis.\nLive-imaging reveals Coordinated Cell Migration and Cardiac Fate Determination during Mammalian Gastrulation.\nAuthors: Abukar, S.; Embacher, P.; Cicarrelli, A.; Varsani-Brown, S.; Dean, J. A.; Briscoe, J.; Ivanovitch, k.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572445\nHeart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.\nDNA replication in early mammalian embryos is patterned, predisposing lamina-associated regions to fragility\nAuthors: Xu, S.; Wang, N.; Zuccaro, M.; Gerhardt, J.; Baslan, T.; Koren, A.; Egli, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573304\nDNA replication in differentiated cells follows a defined program, but when and how it is established during mammalian development is not known. Here we show using single-cell sequencing, that both bovine and mouse cleavage stage embryos progress through S-phase in a defined pattern. Late replicating regions are associated with the nuclear lamina from the first cell cycle after fertilization, and contain few active origins, and few but long genes. Chromosome breaks, which form spontaneously in bovine embryos at sites concordant with human embryos, preferentially locate to late replicating regions. In mice, late replicating regions show enhanced fragility due to a sparsity of dormant origins that can be activated under conditions of replication stress. This pattern predisposes regions with long neuronal genes to fragility and genetic change prior to segregation of soma and germ line. Our studies show that the formation of early and late replicating regions is among the first layers of epigenetic regulation established on the mammalian genome after fertilization.\nDirect Male Development in Chromosomally ZZ Zebrafish\nAuthors: Wilson, C. A.; Batzel, P.; Postlethwait, J. H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573483\nThe genetics of sex determination varies across taxa, sometimes even within a species. Major domesticated strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including AB and TU, lack a strong genetic sex determining locus, but strains more recently derived from nature, like Nadia (NA), possess a ZZ male/ZW female chromosomal sex-determination system. AB strain fish pass through a juvenile ovary stage, forming oocytes that survive in fish that become females but die in fish that become males. To understand mechanisms of gonad development in NA zebrafish, we studied histology and single cell transcriptomics in developing ZZ and ZW fish. ZW fish developed oocytes by 22 days post-fertilization (dpf) but ZZ fish directly formed testes, avoiding a juvenile ovary phase. Gonads of some ZW and WW fish, however, developed oocytes that died as the gonad became a testis, mimicking AB fish, suggesting that the gynogenetically derived AB strain is chromosomally WW. Single-cell RNA-seq of 19dpf gonads showed similar cell types in ZZ and ZW fish, including germ cells, precursors of gonadal support cells, steroidogenic cells, interstitial/stromal cells, and immune cells, consistent with a bipotential juvenile gonad. In contrast, scRNA-seq of 30dpf gonads revealed that cells in ZZ gonads had transcriptomes characteristic of testicular Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells while ZW gonads had granulosa cells, theca cells, and developing oocytes. Hematopoietic and vascular cells were similar in both sex genotypes. These results show that juvenile NA zebrafish initially develop a bipotential gonad; that a factor on the NA W chromosome or fewer than two Z chromosomes is essential to initiate oocyte development; and without the W factor or with two Z doses, NA gonads develop directly into testes without passing through the juvenile ovary stage. Sex determination in AB and TU strains mimics NA ZW and WW zebrafish, suggesting loss of the Z chromosome during domestication. Genetic analysis of the NA strain will facilitate our understanding of the evolution of sex determination mechanisms.\nLearning a conserved mechanism for early neuroectoderm morphogenesis\nAuthors: Lefebvre, M. F.; Colen, J.; Claussen, N. H.; Brauns, F.; Raich, M. K.; Mitchell, N.; Fruchart, M.; Vitelli, V.; Streichan, S. J.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573058\nMorphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.\nSteroid signaling controls sex-specific development in an invertebrate\nAuthors: Grmai, L.; Jimenez, E.; Baxter, K.; Van Doren, M.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573099\nIn vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.\nMaternal gut Bifidobacterium breve modifies fetal brain metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lopez-Tello, J.; Kiu, R.; Schofield, Z.; van Sinderen, D.; Le Gall, G.; Hall, L. J.; Sferruzzi-Perri, A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573756\nIn recent years, our understanding of the gut microbiome's impact on host physiology and metabolism has grown exponentially. Yet, the specific role of certain microorganisms in regulating gestational health and fetal development remains largely unexplored. During pregnancy, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus that provides multiple benefits, including changes in placental development and fetal glycaemia. In this study, using germ-free mice colonized with or without Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 during pregnancy, we demonstrated that this bacterium is important for controlling fetal brain metabolism. In particular, presence of maternal Bifidobacterium led to reduced levels of nine metabolites (including citrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and carnitine) in the fetal brain, with concurrent elevated abundance of transporters involved in glucose and branched-chain amino acid uptake. B. breve supplementation was also associated with increased expression of critical metabolic and cellular pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, AMPK, STAT5 and Wnt-{beta}-catenin (including its receptor Frizzled-7) in the fetal brain. Furthermore, maternal-associated Bifidobacterium resulted in HIF-2 protein stabilization and altered a number of genes and proteins involved in cellular growth, axogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These findings highlight that Bifidobacterium breve colonisation of the maternal gut is important for the metabolism and growth of the fetal brain.\nDihydroceramide desaturase governs endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet homeostasis to promote glial function in the nervous system\nAuthors: Zhu, Y.; Cho, K.; Lacin, H.; Zhu, Y.; DiPaola, J.; Wilson, B. A.; Patti, G. J.; Skeath, J. B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573836\nDihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides in the last step of the de novo ceramide pathway. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function in humans leads to the rare neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18, but the exact mechanism that underlies the disease remains unclear. Through a forward genetic screen, we discovered that infertile crescent (ifc), the sole Drosophila dihydroceramide desaturase, governs central nervous system development and morphology. Expressed and genetically active most prominently in glia rather than neurons, ifc primarily controls nervous system development through a cell autonomous function in glia. Within the nervous system, loss of ifc results in ceramide depletion, dihydroceramide accumulation, and increased saturation of major membrane phospholipids. At the cellular level, loss of ifc leads to severe glial defects, particularly in cortex glia, including expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, cell swelling, failure to enwrap neurons, and lipid droplet depletion. Our research supports a model in which inappropriate retention of dihydroceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of glial cells drives ER expansion and cell swelling, disrupting glial function and leading to subsequent nervous system dysfunction. Given the conserved nature of the de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway, our findings in the fly system suggest that dihydroceramide-triggered expansion of the ER in the membrane-rich glial cells may be the proximal cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 in humans.\nCell density couples tissue mechanics to control the elongation speed of the body axis\nAuthors: Lu, C.; Vidigueira, J. M. N.; Jie, C. C. J.; Maksymiuk, A.; Xiong, F.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573670\nThe vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation (1,2,3). Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock (4). As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size (5,6) or elongation progress (7,8), the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy (9) on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system - the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) can differentiate into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), a critical step in the generation of the integrated embryo model termed blastoid. The current paradigm of blastoid generation necessitates the aggregation of dozens of nPSCs treated with multiple small molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or genetic modifications to initiate TE differentiation. The presence of complex crosstalk among pathways and cellular heterogeneity in these models complicates mechanistic study and genetic screens. Here, we show that a single small molecule, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potently induces TE differentiation in basal medium without pharmacological and genetic perturbations. DMSO enhances blastoid generation and, more importantly, is sufficient for blastoid generation by itself. DMSO blastoids resemble blastocysts in morphology and lineage composition. DMSO induces blastoid formation through PKC signaling and cell cycle regulation. Lastly, DMSO enables single nPSC-derived clonal blastoids, which could facilitate genetic screens for mechanistic understanding of human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA replication in differentiated cells follows a defined program, but when and how it is established during mammalian development is not known. Here we show using single-cell sequencing, that both bovine and mouse cleavage stage embryos progress through S-phase in a defined pattern. Late replicating regions are associated with the nuclear lamina from the first cell cycle after fertilization, and contain few active origins, and few but long genes. Chromosome breaks, which form spontaneously in bovine embryos at sites concordant with human embryos, preferentially locate to late replicating regions. In mice, late replicating regions show enhanced fragility due to a sparsity of dormant origins that can be activated under conditions of replication stress. This pattern predisposes regions with long neuronal genes to fragility and genetic change prior to segregation of soma and germ line. Our studies show that the formation of early and late replicating regions is among the first layers of epigenetic regulation established on the mammalian genome after fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The genetics of sex determination varies across taxa, sometimes even within a species. Major domesticated strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including AB and TU, lack a strong genetic sex determining locus, but strains more recently derived from nature, like Nadia (NA), possess a ZZ male/ZW female chromosomal sex-determination system. AB strain fish pass through a juvenile ovary stage, forming oocytes that survive in fish that become females but die in fish that become males. To understand mechanisms of gonad development in NA zebrafish, we studied histology and single cell transcriptomics in developing ZZ and ZW fish. ZW fish developed oocytes by 22 days post-fertilization (dpf) but ZZ fish directly formed testes, avoiding a juvenile ovary phase. Gonads of some ZW and WW fish, however, developed oocytes that died as the gonad became a testis, mimicking AB fish, suggesting that the gynogenetically derived AB strain is chromosomally WW. Single-cell RNA-seq of 19dpf gonads showed similar cell types in ZZ and ZW fish, including germ cells, precursors of gonadal support cells, steroidogenic cells, interstitial/stromal cells, and immune cells, consistent with a bipotential juvenile gonad. In contrast, scRNA-seq of 30dpf gonads revealed that cells in ZZ gonads had transcriptomes characteristic of testicular Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells while ZW gonads had granulosa cells, theca cells, and developing oocytes. Hematopoietic and vascular cells were similar in both sex genotypes. These results show that juvenile NA zebrafish initially develop a bipotential gonad; that a factor on the NA W chromosome or fewer than two Z chromosomes is essential to initiate oocyte development; and without the W factor or with two Z doses, NA gonads develop directly into testes without passing through the juvenile ovary stage. Sex determination in AB and TU strains mimics NA ZW and WW zebrafish, suggesting loss of the Z chromosome during domestication. Genetic analysis of the NA strain will facilitate our understanding of the evolution of sex determination mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, our understanding of the gut microbiome&#39;s impact on host physiology and metabolism has grown exponentially. Yet, the specific role of certain microorganisms in regulating gestational health and fetal development remains largely unexplored. During pregnancy, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus that provides multiple benefits, including changes in placental development and fetal glycaemia. In this study, using germ-free mice colonized with or without Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 during pregnancy, we demonstrated that this bacterium is important for controlling fetal brain metabolism. In particular, presence of maternal Bifidobacterium led to reduced levels of nine metabolites (including citrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and carnitine) in the fetal brain, with concurrent elevated abundance of transporters involved in glucose and branched-chain amino acid uptake. B. breve supplementation was also associated with increased expression of critical metabolic and cellular pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, AMPK, STAT5 and Wnt-{beta}-catenin (including its receptor Frizzled-7) in the fetal brain. Furthermore, maternal-associated Bifidobacterium resulted in HIF-2 protein stabilization and altered a number of genes and proteins involved in cellular growth, axogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These findings highlight that Bifidobacterium breve colonisation of the maternal gut is important for the metabolism and growth of the fetal brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides in the last step of the de novo ceramide pathway. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function in humans leads to the rare neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18, but the exact mechanism that underlies the disease remains unclear. Through a forward genetic screen, we discovered that infertile crescent (ifc), the sole Drosophila dihydroceramide desaturase, governs central nervous system development and morphology. Expressed and genetically active most prominently in glia rather than neurons, ifc primarily controls nervous system development through a cell autonomous function in glia. Within the nervous system, loss of ifc results in ceramide depletion, dihydroceramide accumulation, and increased saturation of major membrane phospholipids. At the cellular level, loss of ifc leads to severe glial defects, particularly in cortex glia, including expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, cell swelling, failure to enwrap neurons, and lipid droplet depletion. Our research supports a model in which inappropriate retention of dihydroceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of glial cells drives ER expansion and cell swelling, disrupting glial function and leading to subsequent nervous system dysfunction. Given the conserved nature of the de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway, our findings in the fly system suggest that dihydroceramide-triggered expansion of the ER in the membrane-rich glial cells may be the proximal cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation (1,2,3). Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock (4). As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size (5,6) or elongation progress (7,8), the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy (9) on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.</p>
