E.; Ikawa, M.; Pauli, A.\nScore: 32.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550750\nFertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.\nGrowth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle\nAuthors: Yadav, A. S.; Hong, L.; Klees, P. M.; Kiss, A.; He, X.; Barrios, I. M.; Heeney, M.; Galang, A. M. D.; Smith, R. S.; Boudaoud, A.; Roeder, A. H. K.\nScore: 27.9, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.549953\nFrom smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes. One-Sentence SummaryThe keys to unlocking sepal smoothness are unidirectional growth and even stiffness; misplace them, its time to buckle up!\nBMP-dependent patterning of ectoderm tissue material properties modulates lateral mesendoderm cell migration during early zebrafish gastrulation\nAuthors: Tavano, S.; Brueckner, D. B.; Tasciyan, S.; Tong, X.; Kardos, R.; Schauer, A.; Hauschild, R.; Heisenberg, C.-P.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550024\nCell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.\nMacrophages heterogeneity and significance during human fetal pancreatic development\nAuthors: Migliorini, A.; Ge, S.; Atkins, M. H.; Sambathkumar, R.; Sing, A.; Chua, C.; Gehring, A. J.; Keller, G. M.; Notta, F.; Nostro, M. C.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.549142\nOrganogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW) but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.\nOrb2 enables rare-codon-enriched mRNA expression during Drosophila neuron differentiation\nAuthors: Stewart, R. K.; Nguyen, P.; Laederach, A.; Volkan, P. C.; Sawyer, J. K.; Fox, D. T.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550700\nRegulation of codon optimality is an increasingly appreciated layer of cell- and tissue-specific protein expression control. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to show that differentiation of Drosophila neural stem cells into neurons enables protein expression from rare-codon-enriched genes. From a candidate screen, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein Orb2 as a positive regulator of rare-codon-dependent expression in neurons. Using RNA sequencing, we reveal that Orb2-upregulated mRNAs in the brain with abundant Orb2 binding sites have a rare-codon bias. From these Orb2-regulated mRNAs, we demonstrate that rare-codon enrichment is important for expression control and social behavior function of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which neural stem cell differentiation shifts genetic code regulation to enable critical mRNA and protein expression.\nIn vivo reprogramming and epigenetic rejuvenation of adult cardiomyocytes ameliorate heart failure in mice\nAuthors: de Lazaro, I.; Zhang, B.; Makarova, N. E.; Mariotti, M.; Orejon-Sanchez, T. L.; Tringides, C. M.; Gladyshev, V. N.; Mooney, D.\nScore: 18.3, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2021.12.22.473302\nPartial cell reprogramming has been demonstrated in certain mouse tissues by in situ overexpression of Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc (OKSM) transcription factors, and can induce rejuvenation and/or augment regeneration. Reprogramming of adult cardiomyocytes has been elusive until recently, but its success could help overcome the lack of endogenous regenerative capacity of the mammalian myocardium. Here, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific, doxycycline-inducible, reprogrammable mice and demonstrated that sustained OKSM induction reprograms cardiomyocytes fully into teratoma-forming pluripotent cells. However, we also showed that cyclic OKSM upregulation induces significant decrease of epigenetic age in the cardiomyocytes without de-differentiation or reacquisition of pluripotency. In mice with progressive heart failure, cardiomyocyte epigenetic rejuvenation correlated with stabilization of systolic heart function. These findings confirm that OKSM can reprogram adult mouse cardiomyocytes to different states depending on the duration of their expression, and provide further evidence that partially reprogrammed cardiomyocytes may contribute to ameliorate cardiac disease.\nDevelopment of a hepatic cryoinjury model to study liver regeneration\nAuthors: Sande-Melon, M.; Bergemann, D.; Gonzalez-Rosa, J. M.; Cox, A. G.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-07-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.550437\nThe liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

K. G.; Shaw, H. G.; Murray, D. H.; Findlay, G. M.; Januschke, J.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550680\nThe generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of Drosophila, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts, and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel in vivo phosphorylation of Bazooka, the Drosophila homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. Remarkably, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts and sensory organ precursors, and not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. We further show that Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation in neuroblasts and sensory organ formation in sensory organ precursors. Finally, we show that CDK1 can phosphorylate human PARD3 in vitro, suggestive of a conserved kinase-substrate relationship between CDK1 and PAR-3.\nConnexin 41.8 mediates the correct temporal induction of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells\nAuthors: Petzold, T.; Watanabe, M.; BERTRAND, J. Y.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550806\nHaematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to- haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2alpha (Hif1/2alpha), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.\nHindbrain rhombomere centers harbor a heterogenous population of dividing progenitors which rely on Notch-signaling\nAuthors: Belmonte-Mateos, C.; Meister, L.; Pujades, C.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550945\nTissue growth and morphogenesis are interrelated processes, whose tight coordination is essential for the production of different cell fates and the timely precise allocation of stem cell capacities. The zebrafish embryonic brainstem, the hindbrain, exemplifies such coupling between spatiotemporal cell diversity acquisition and tissue growth, as the neurogenic commitment is differentially distributed over time. Here, we combined cell lineage and in vivo imaging approaches to reveal the emergence of different specific cell population properties within the very same rhombomeres, and focused on the hindbrain rhombomere centers. We studied the molecular identity of rhombomere centers, and showed that they harbor different progenitor capacities that change over time. By clonal analysis, we revealed that cells within the rhombomeres decrease the proliferative capacity over time to remain mainly in G1-phase. Proliferating progenitors give rise to neurons by asymmetric and symmetric neurogenic divisions, while maintaining the pool of progenitors. The proliferative capacity of these cells differs from their neighbors, and they are delayed in the onset of Notch-activity. By functional studies we demonstrated that they rely on Notch3-signaling to be maintained as non-committed progenitors. In this study we show that cells in rhombomere centers might share steps of a similar program, despite the neurogenic asynchrony from the rhombomere counterparts, to ensure proper tissue growth.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe keys to unlocking sepal smoothness are unidirectional growth and even stiffness; misplace them, its time to buckle up!</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organogenesis is a complex process that relies on a dynamic interplay between extrinsic factors originating from the microenvironment and intrinsic factors specific to the tissue. For the endocrine cells of the islet of Langerhans, the local microenvironment consists of various cell types including pancreatic acinar and ductal cells as well as neuronal, immune, endothelial, and stromal cells. Interestingly, hematopoietic cells have been detected in human pancreas as early as 6 post-conception weeks (PCW) but whether they play a role during islet formation in humans remains largely unknown. To shed light on this question, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing of the human fetal pancreas during the early weeks of the second trimester, specifically focusing on the molecular interaction between the hematopoietic niche and the pancreatic epithelium. Our analysis identified a wide range of hematopoietic cells as well as two distinct subsets of macrophages that are unique to the fetal pancreas and absent in neonatal or adult pancreatic tissues. Leveraging this discovery, we developed a co-culture system of hESC-derived endocrine-macrophage organoids to model their interaction in vitro. Remarkably, we found that macrophages promoted the differentiation and viability of developing endocrine cells in vitro and enhanced tissue engraftment in immunocompromised mice, supporting a role for these cells in future tissue engineering strategies for diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulation of codon optimality is an increasingly appreciated layer of cell- and tissue-specific protein expression control. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to show that differentiation of Drosophila neural stem cells into neurons enables protein expression from rare-codon-enriched genes. From a candidate screen, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) protein Orb2 as a positive regulator of rare-codon-dependent expression in neurons. Using RNA sequencing, we reveal that Orb2-upregulated mRNAs in the brain with abundant Orb2 binding sites have a rare-codon bias. From these Orb2-regulated mRNAs, we demonstrate that rare-codon enrichment is important for expression control and social behavior function of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). Our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which neural stem cell differentiation shifts genetic code regulation to enable critical mRNA and protein expression.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Partial cell reprogramming has been demonstrated in certain mouse tissues by in situ overexpression of Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc (OKSM) transcription factors, and can induce rejuvenation and/or augment regeneration. Reprogramming of adult cardiomyocytes has been elusive until recently, but its success could help overcome the lack of endogenous regenerative capacity of the mammalian myocardium. Here, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific, doxycycline-inducible, reprogrammable mice and demonstrated that sustained OKSM induction reprograms cardiomyocytes fully into teratoma-forming pluripotent cells. However, we also showed that cyclic OKSM upregulation induces significant decrease of epigenetic age in the cardiomyocytes without de-differentiation or reacquisition of pluripotency. In mice with progressive heart failure, cardiomyocyte epigenetic rejuvenation correlated with stabilization of systolic heart function. These findings confirm that OKSM can reprogram adult mouse cardiomyocytes to different states depending on the duration of their expression, and provide further evidence that partially reprogrammed cardiomyocytes may contribute to ameliorate cardiac disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The liver is a remarkable organ that can regenerate in response to injury. Depending on the extent of injury, the liver can undergo compensatory hyperplasia or fibrosis. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood. Here, we developed a new model to study liver regeneration based on cryoinjury. To visualise liver regeneration at cellular resolution, we adapted the CUBIC tissue-clearing approach. Hepatic cryoinjury induced a localised necrotic and apoptotic lesion characterised by inflammation and infiltration of innate immune cells. Following this initial phase, we observed fibrosis, which resolved as regeneration re-established homeostasis in 30 days. Importantly, this approach enables the comparison of healthy and injured parenchyma with an individual animal, providing unique advantages to previous models. In summary, the hepatic cryoinjury model provides a fast and reproducible method for studying the cellular and molecular pathways underpinning fibrosis and liver regeneration.

        <p class="abstract">The generation of distinct cell fates during development depends on asymmetric cell division of progenitor cells. In the central and peripheral nervous system of Drosophila, progenitor cells respectively called neuroblasts or sensory organ precursors use PAR polarity during mitosis to control cell fate determination in their daughter cells. How polarity and the cell cycle are coupled, and how the cell cycle machinery regulates PAR protein function and cell fate determination is poorly understood. Here, we generate an analog sensitive allele of CDK1 and reveal that its partial inhibition weakens but does not abolish apical polarity in embryonic and larval neuroblasts, and leads to defects in polarisation of fate determinants. We describe a novel in vivo phosphorylation of Bazooka, the Drosophila homolog of PAR-3, on Serine180, a consensus CDK phosphorylation site. Remarkably, phosphorylation of Serine180 occurs in asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts and sensory organ precursors, and not in their symmetrically dividing neighbours. We further show that Serine180 phosphomutants disrupt the timing of basal polarisation in neuroblasts and sensory organ formation in sensory organ precursors. Finally, we show that CDK1 can phosphorylate human PARD3 in vitro, suggestive of a conserved kinase-substrate relationship between CDK1 and PAR-3.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derive from a subset of endothelial cells (ECs), known as haemogenic ECs by the process of endothelial-to- haematopoietic transition (EHT) [1-4]. Although many factors involved in EHT have been elucidated [5], we still have a poor understanding of the temporal regulation of this process. Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to stabilise hypoxia-inducible factors 1/2alpha (Hif1/2alpha), allowing them to positively regulate EHT [6, 7]. Here, we show a developmental delay in EHT and HSPC induction in a gap junction mutant, connexin (cx)41.8 (orthologous to mammalian CX40), in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, CX40 has been shown to localise to the mitochondria [8]. We demonstrate that Cx41.8 is important for the correct temporal generation of mitochondrial ROS, which stabilise the Hif pathway, allowing for the subsequent specification of the haemogenic endothelium. Taken together, our data indicate that Cx41.8 mediates the correct induction of HSPCs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue growth and morphogenesis are interrelated processes, whose tight coordination is essential for the production of different cell fates and the timely precise allocation of stem cell capacities. The zebrafish embryonic brainstem, the hindbrain, exemplifies such coupling between spatiotemporal cell diversity acquisition and tissue growth, as the neurogenic commitment is differentially distributed over time. Here, we combined cell lineage and in vivo imaging approaches to reveal the emergence of different specific cell population properties within the very same rhombomeres, and focused on the hindbrain rhombomere centers. We studied the molecular identity of rhombomere centers, and showed that they harbor different progenitor capacities that change over time. By clonal analysis, we revealed that cells within the rhombomeres decrease the proliferative capacity over time to remain mainly in G1-phase. Proliferating progenitors give rise to neurons by asymmetric and symmetric neurogenic divisions, while maintaining the pool of progenitors. The proliferative capacity of these cells differs from their neighbors, and they are delayed in the onset of Notch-activity. By functional studies we demonstrated that they rely on Notch3-signaling to be maintained as non-committed progenitors. In this study we show that cells in rhombomere centers might share steps of a similar program, despite the neurogenic asynchrony from the rhombomere counterparts, to ensure proper tissue growth.</p>
