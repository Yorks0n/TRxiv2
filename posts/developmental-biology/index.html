  "articleBody": " Loss of PAX6 alters the excitatory/inhibitory neuronal ratio in human cerebral organoids\nAuthors: Chan, W. K.; Negro, D.; Munro, V. M.; Marshall, H. L.; Kozic, Z.; Brown, M.; Beltran, M.; Henderson, N.; Price, D. J.; Mason, J. O.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-08-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551262\nThe transcription factor PAX6 is a crucial regulator of multiple aspects of embryonic forebrain development. Its well-known roles in mice include regulating differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the embryonic cortex. PAX6s roles during human forebrain development are less well understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we investigated PAX6s roles in human neurodevelopment. Homozygous PAX6 mutant (PAX6-/-) organoids were larger than controls and contained inhibitory cell types not found in PAX6+/+ controls. These inhibitory cells exhibited clear transcriptomic similarities and comparable distribution to analogous inhibitory cells previously described in Pax6-/- mice. Differentiation trajectory inferencing showed that the inhibitory cells were generated from both radial glia and neuroectodermal progenitor populations. Inferring cell-cell communication using CellChat showed that loss of PAX6 in cerebral organoids increased the probability of cells engaging with inappropriate signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that while PAX6s role in controlling excitatory versus inhibitory neural differentiation is conserved, there are alterations in the activities of intercellular signalling pathways in human PAX6-/- cortical progenitors that have not been described in mice, indicating potential species-specific mechanistic differences. Summary StatementTo identify likely roles of PAX6 during human embryonic development, we generated and analysed human PAX6 mutant cerebral organoids, revealing strong similarities and some differences to Pax6s well-known roles in rodents.\nReversal of Biological Age in Multiple Rat Organs by Young Porcine Plasma Fraction\nAuthors: Horvath, S.; Singh, K.; Raj, K.; Khairnar, S.; Sanghavi, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Zoller, J. A.; Li, C. Z.; Herenu, C. B.; Canatelli-Mallat, M.; Lehmann, M.; Habazin, S.; Vuckovic, F.; Solberg-Woods, L.; Garcia Martinez, A.; Wang, T.; Chiavellini, P.; Levine, A. J.; Chen, H.; Brooke, R. T.; Gordevicius, J.; Lauc, G.; Goya, R. G.; Katcher, H. L.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552148\nYoung blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro- to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.\nSpontaneous enteric nervous system activity precedes maturation of gastrointestinal motility\nAuthors: Dershowitz, L. B.; Garcia, H. B.; Perley, A. S.; Coleman, T. P.; Kaltschmidt, J. A.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551847\nSpontaneous neuronal network activity is essential in development of central and peripheral circuits, yet whether this is a feature of enteric nervous system development has yet to be established. Using ex vivo gastrointestinal (GI) motility assays with unbiased computational analyses, we identify a previously unknown pattern of spontaneous neurogenic GI motility. We further show that this motility is driven by cholinergic signaling, which may inform GI pharmacology for preterm patients.\nA molecular atlas of adult C. elegans motor neurons reveals ancient diversity delineated by conserved transcription factor codes\nAuthors: Smith, J. J.; Taylor, S. R.; Blum, J. A.; Gitler, A.; Miller, D. M.; Kratsios, P.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552048\nMotor neurons (MNs) constitute an ancient cell type targeted by multiple adult-onset diseases. It is therefore important to define the molecular makeup of adult MNs in animal models and extract organizing principles. Here, we generated a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans MNs and a searchable database (http://celegans.spinalcordatlas.org). Single-cell RNA-sequencing of 13,200 cells revealed that ventral nerve cord MNs cluster into 29 molecularly distinct subclasses. All subclasses are delineated by unique expression codes of either neuropeptide or transcription factor gene families. Strikingly, we found that combinatorial codes of homeodomain transcription factor genes define adult MN diversity both in C. elegans and mice. Further, molecularly defined MN subclasses in C. elegans display distinct patterns of connectivity. Hence, our study couples the connectivity map of the C. elegans motor circuit with a molecular atlas of its constituent MNs, and uncovers organizing principles and conserved molecular codes of adult MN diversity.\nTranscriptional control of compartmental boundary positioning during Drosophila wing development\nAuthors: Aguilar, G.; Sickmann, M. E.; Born, G.; Bieli, D.; Affolter, M.; Müller, M.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.05.552106\nThe establishment of tissue axes is fundamental during embryonic development. In the Drosophila wing, the anterior/posterior (AP) and the dorsal/ventral (DV) compartment boundaries provide the basic coordinates around which the tissue develops. These boundaries arise as a result of two lineage decisions, the acquisition of posterior fate by the selector gene engrailed (en) and of dorsal fate by the selector gene apterous (ap). While en expression domain is set up during embryogenesis, ap expression only starts during early wing development. Thus, the correct establishment of ap expression pattern with respect to en must be tightly controlled. Here we have functionally investigated the transcriptional inputs integrated by the early ap enhancer (apE) and their requirement for correct boundary positioning. Detailed mutational analyses using CRISPR/Cas revealed a role of apE in positioning the DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary, with apE mutants often displaying mirror-image anterior wing duplications. We then accomplished tissue-specific enhancer disruption via dCas9 expression. This approach allowed us to dissect the spatio-temporal requirement of apE function, challenging the mechanism by which apE miss-regulation leads to AP defects. Base-pair resolution analyses of apE uncovered a single HOX binding site essential for wing development, which, when mutated, led to wingless flies. Along these lines, we found that the HOX gene Antennapedia (Antp) is fundamental for ap expression. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription factors Pointed (Pnt), Homothorax (Hth) and Grain (Grn) are necessary for apE function. Together, our results provide a comprehensive molecular basis of early ap activation and the developmental consequences of its miss-regulation, shedding light on how compartmental boundaries are be set up during development.\nPolyadenylation of mRNAs encoding secreted proteins by TENT5 family of enzymes is essential for gametogenesis in mice.\nAuthors: Brouze, M.; Cieciura, A. C.; Gewartowska, O.; Kusio-Kobialka, M.; Jachacy, K.; Szpila, M.; Tarkowski, B.; Gruchota, J.; Krawczyk, P.; Mroczek, S.; Borsuk, E.; Dziembowski, A.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551432\nCytoplasmic polyadenylation plays a vital role in gametogenesis, however, the participating enzymes and substrates in mammals remain unclear. Using knockout and knock-in mouse models, we describe the essential role of 4 TENT5 poly(A) polymerases in mice fertility and gametogenesis. TENT5B and TENT5C play crucial, but redundant roles in oogenesis, with double knockout of both genes leading to oocyte degeneration. Additionally, TENT5B-GFP knock-in females display gain-of-function infertility effect with multiple chromosomal aberrations in ovulated oocytes. TENT5C and TENT5D both regulate different stages of spermatogenesis, shown by sterility of males with either genes knockout mutation. Finally, Tent5a knockout significantly lowers fertility, although the underlying mechanism is not directly related to gametogenesis. Through Direct RNA sequencing we discovered that TENT5s polyadenylate mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted proteins essential for gametogenesis. Sequence motives analysis and reporter mRNA assay revealed that the presence of endoplasmic reticulum-leader represents the primary determinant of TENT5-mediated regulation.\nGlobal decoupling of cell differentiation from cell division in early embryo development\nAuthors: Kukreja, K.; Patel, N.; Megason, S. G.; Klein, A. M.\nScore: 44.5, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551123\nAs tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.\nThe two plant-specific DREAM components FLIC and FLAC repress floral transition in Arabidopsis\nAuthors: Lang, L.; Boewer, F.; Tuncay-Elbasi, H.; Eeckhout, D.; Marschlich, N.; de Jaeger, G.; Heese, M.; Schnittger, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552284\nThe DREAM complex is a key transcriptional regulator especially involved in the control of the cell cycle and development. Here, we characterise two novel plant-specific DREAM components, FLIC and FLAC, which we identified through tandem affinity purification experiments as interactors of conserved core DREAM constituents. We demonstrate that plants lacking both FLIC and FLAC exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including stunted growth and reduced fertility. Notably, flic flac double mutants show an early-flowering phenotype, an aspect that we found to be shared with mutants of the core DREAM component LIN37, with which FLIC and FLAC interact in binary protein-protein interaction assays. Performing reverse affinity purification experiments, we detected the JMJ14/NAC050/NAC052 module, known for its involvement in flowering repression, in the interactome of both FLIC and FLAC. Subsequent binary interaction studies then link the JMJ14/NAC050/NAC052 module via LIN37 to the DREAM complex providing a mechanistic framework on how flowering time could be transcriptionally controlled by the DREAM complex.\nMembrane molecule bouncer enables follicle fertilization in a viviparous teleost: Poecilia reticulata (guppy)\nAuthors: Yoshida, J.; Tajika, Y.; Uchida, K.; Kuwahara, M.; Sano, K.; Suzuki, T.; Hondo, E.; Iida, A.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551741\nFertilization is a fundamental mechanism of sexual reproduction. Generally, oocytes are ovulated from the ovarian follicles and contact the sperm outside the ovarian medulla. Unlike this, follicle fertilization which means the egg contact with sperm in the ovarian medulla without ovulation is known in the viviparous teleost species belonging to the Poeciliidae. In this study, we focused on a viviparous teleost species, Poecilia reticulata (guppy). Our sperm tracking assay indicated that the sperm reached the immature oocytes with a germinal vesicle, and the fertilized immature oocytes were presumed to contribute to littermates. The binding between immature oocytes and sperm is a specific trait in the guppy, which was not observed in Danio rerio (zebrafish) or Oryzias latipes (medaka). The loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that bouncer plays a critical role in immature oocyte-to-sperm binding. This fertilization trait in immature oocytes may provide certain advantages for females with respect to nutrition or other gestation costs. Our findings shed light on the unique reproductive strategies of guppy and contribute to our understanding of the diverse reproductive mechanisms in vertebrates. Summary statementUnlike general vertebrates, guppys oocyte fertilizes with sperm in the ovarian medulla at the immature stages. The distinctive trait depends on the Ly6/uPAR protein bouncer.\nPeriods of environmental sensitivity couple larval behavior and development\nAuthors: Faerberg, D. F.; Aprison, E. Z.; Ruvinsky, I.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.552015\nThe typical life cycle in most animal phyla includes a larval period that bridges embryogenesis and adulthood1. Despite the great diversity of larval forms, all larvae grow, acquire adult morphology and function, while navigating their habitats to obtain resources necessary for development. How larval development is coordinated with behavior remains substantially unclear. Here, we describe features of the iterative organization of larval stages that serve to assess the environment and procure resources prior to costly developmental commitments. We found that male-excreted pheromones accelerate2-4 the onset of adulthood in C. elegans hermaphrodites by coordinately advancing multiple developmental events and growth during the last larval stage. The larvae are sensitive to the accelerating male pheromones only at the end of the penultimate larval stage, just before the acceleration begins. Other larval stages also contain windows of sensitivity to environmental inputs. Importantly, behaviors associated with search and consumption of food are distinct between early and late portions of larval stages. We infer that each larval stage in C. elegans is subdivided into two epochs: A) global assessment of the environment to identify the most suitable patch and B) consumption of sufficient food and acquisition of salient information for developmental events in the next stage. We predict that in larvae of other species behavior is also divided into distinct epochs optimized either for assessing the habitat or obtaining the resources. Thus, a major role of larval behavior is to coordinate the orderly progression of development in variable environments.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The transcription factor PAX6 is a crucial regulator of multiple aspects of embryonic forebrain development. Its well-known roles in mice include regulating differentiation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the embryonic cortex. PAX6s roles during human forebrain development are less well understood. Using human cerebral organoids, we investigated PAX6s roles in human neurodevelopment. Homozygous PAX6 mutant (PAX6-/-) organoids were larger than controls and contained inhibitory cell types not found in PAX6&#43;/&#43; controls. These inhibitory cells exhibited clear transcriptomic similarities and comparable distribution to analogous inhibitory cells previously described in Pax6-/- mice. Differentiation trajectory inferencing showed that the inhibitory cells were generated from both radial glia and neuroectodermal progenitor populations. Inferring cell-cell communication using CellChat showed that loss of PAX6 in cerebral organoids increased the probability of cells engaging with inappropriate signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that while PAX6s role in controlling excitatory versus inhibitory neural differentiation is conserved, there are alterations in the activities of intercellular signalling pathways in human PAX6-/- cortical progenitors that have not been described in mice, indicating potential species-specific mechanistic differences.

Summary StatementTo identify likely roles of PAX6 during human embryonic development, we generated and analysed human PAX6 mutant cerebral organoids, revealing strong similarities and some differences to Pax6s well-known roles in rodents.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro- to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spontaneous neuronal network activity is essential in development of central and peripheral circuits, yet whether this is a feature of enteric nervous system development has yet to be established. Using ex vivo gastrointestinal (GI) motility assays with unbiased computational analyses, we identify a previously unknown pattern of spontaneous neurogenic GI motility. We further show that this motility is driven by cholinergic signaling, which may inform GI pharmacology for preterm patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Motor neurons (MNs) constitute an ancient cell type targeted by multiple adult-onset diseases. It is therefore important to define the molecular makeup of adult MNs in animal models and extract organizing principles. Here, we generated a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans MNs and a searchable database (http://celegans.spinalcordatlas.org). Single-cell RNA-sequencing of 13,200 cells revealed that ventral nerve cord MNs cluster into 29 molecularly distinct subclasses. All subclasses are delineated by unique expression codes of either neuropeptide or transcription factor gene families. Strikingly, we found that combinatorial codes of homeodomain transcription factor genes define adult MN diversity both in C. elegans and mice. Further, molecularly defined MN subclasses in C. elegans display distinct patterns of connectivity. Hence, our study couples the connectivity map of the C. elegans motor circuit with a molecular atlas of its constituent MNs, and uncovers organizing principles and conserved molecular codes of adult MN diversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The establishment of tissue axes is fundamental during embryonic development. In the Drosophila wing, the anterior/posterior (AP) and the dorsal/ventral (DV) compartment boundaries provide the basic coordinates around which the tissue develops. These boundaries arise as a result of two lineage decisions, the acquisition of posterior fate by the selector gene engrailed (en) and of dorsal fate by the selector gene apterous (ap). While en expression domain is set up during embryogenesis, ap expression only starts during early wing development. Thus, the correct establishment of ap expression pattern with respect to en must be tightly controlled. Here we have functionally investigated the transcriptional inputs integrated by the early ap enhancer (apE) and their requirement for correct boundary positioning. Detailed mutational analyses using CRISPR/Cas revealed a role of apE in positioning the DV boundary with respect to the AP boundary, with apE mutants often displaying mirror-image anterior wing duplications. We then accomplished tissue-specific enhancer disruption via dCas9 expression. This approach allowed us to dissect the spatio-temporal requirement of apE function, challenging the mechanism by which apE miss-regulation leads to AP defects. Base-pair resolution analyses of apE uncovered a single HOX binding site essential for wing development, which, when mutated, led to wingless flies. Along these lines, we found that the HOX gene Antennapedia (Antp) is fundamental for ap expression. In addition, we demonstrated that the transcription factors Pointed (Pnt), Homothorax (Hth) and Grain (Grn) are necessary for apE function. Together, our results provide a comprehensive molecular basis of early ap activation and the developmental consequences of its miss-regulation, shedding light on how compartmental boundaries are be set up during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cytoplasmic polyadenylation plays a vital role in gametogenesis, however, the participating enzymes and substrates in mammals remain unclear. Using knockout and knock-in mouse models, we describe the essential role of 4 TENT5 poly(A) polymerases in mice fertility and gametogenesis.

TENT5B and TENT5C play crucial, but redundant roles in oogenesis, with double knockout of both genes leading to oocyte degeneration. Additionally, TENT5B-GFP knock-in females display gain-of-function infertility effect with multiple chromosomal aberrations in ovulated oocytes. TENT5C and TENT5D both regulate different stages of spermatogenesis, shown by sterility of males with either genes knockout mutation. Finally, Tent5a knockout significantly lowers fertility, although the underlying mechanism is not directly related to gametogenesis.

Through Direct RNA sequencing we discovered that TENT5s polyadenylate mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted proteins essential for gametogenesis. Sequence motives analysis and reporter mRNA assay revealed that the presence of endoplasmic reticulum-leader represents the primary determinant of TENT5-mediated regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The DREAM complex is a key transcriptional regulator especially involved in the control of the cell cycle and development. Here, we characterise two novel plant-specific DREAM components, FLIC and FLAC, which we identified through tandem affinity purification experiments as interactors of conserved core DREAM constituents. We demonstrate that plants lacking both FLIC and FLAC exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including stunted growth and reduced fertility. Notably, flic flac double mutants show an early-flowering phenotype, an aspect that we found to be shared with mutants of the core DREAM component LIN37, with which FLIC and FLAC interact in binary protein-protein interaction assays. Performing reverse affinity purification experiments, we detected the JMJ14/NAC050/NAC052 module, known for its involvement in flowering repression, in the interactome of both FLIC and FLAC. Subsequent binary interaction studies then link the JMJ14/NAC050/NAC052 module via LIN37 to the DREAM complex providing a mechanistic framework on how flowering time could be transcriptionally controlled by the DREAM complex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fertilization is a fundamental mechanism of sexual reproduction. Generally, oocytes are ovulated from the ovarian follicles and contact the sperm outside the ovarian medulla. Unlike this, follicle fertilization which means the egg contact with sperm in the ovarian medulla without ovulation is known in the viviparous teleost species belonging to the Poeciliidae. In this study, we focused on a viviparous teleost species, Poecilia reticulata (guppy). Our sperm tracking assay indicated that the sperm reached the immature oocytes with a germinal vesicle, and the fertilized immature oocytes were presumed to contribute to littermates. The binding between immature oocytes and sperm is a specific trait in the guppy, which was not observed in Danio rerio (zebrafish) or Oryzias latipes (medaka). The loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that bouncer plays a critical role in immature oocyte-to-sperm binding. This fertilization trait in immature oocytes may provide certain advantages for females with respect to nutrition or other gestation costs. Our findings shed light on the unique reproductive strategies of guppy and contribute to our understanding of the diverse reproductive mechanisms in vertebrates.

Summary statementUnlike general vertebrates, guppys oocyte fertilizes with sperm in the ovarian medulla at the immature stages. The distinctive trait depends on the Ly6/uPAR protein bouncer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The typical life cycle in most animal phyla includes a larval period that bridges embryogenesis and adulthood1. Despite the great diversity of larval forms, all larvae grow, acquire adult morphology and function, while navigating their habitats to obtain resources necessary for development. How larval development is coordinated with behavior remains substantially unclear. Here, we describe features of the iterative organization of larval stages that serve to assess the environment and procure resources prior to costly developmental commitments. We found that male-excreted pheromones accelerate2-4 the onset of adulthood in C. elegans hermaphrodites by coordinately advancing multiple developmental events and growth during the last larval stage. The larvae are sensitive to the accelerating male pheromones only at the end of the penultimate larval stage, just before the acceleration begins. Other larval stages also contain windows of sensitivity to environmental inputs. Importantly, behaviors associated with search and consumption of food are distinct between early and late portions of larval stages. We infer that each larval stage in C. elegans is subdivided into two epochs: A) global assessment of the environment to identify the most suitable patch and B) consumption of sufficient food and acquisition of salient information for developmental events in the next stage. We predict that in larvae of other species behavior is also divided into distinct epochs optimized either for assessing the habitat or obtaining the resources. Thus, a major role of larval behavior is to coordinate the orderly progression of development in variable environments.</p>
