  "articleBody": " Tgfbr1 controls developmental plasticity between the hindlimb and external genitalia by remodeling their regulatory landscape\nAuthors: Lozovska, A.; Korovesi, A. G.; Dias, A.; Lopes, A.; Fowler, D. A.; Martins, G. G.; Novoa, A.; Mallo, M.\nScore: 61.3, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548120\nThe hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species 1. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors 2-5. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.\nSea lamprey enlightens the origin of the coupling of retinoic acid signaling to vertebrate hindbrain segmentation\nAuthors: Bedois, A.; Parker, H. J.; Bronner, M. E.; Krumlauf, R.\nScore: 10.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548143\nRetinoic acid (RA) is involved in antero-posterior patterning of the chordate body axis and, in jawed vertebrates, has been shown to play a major role at multiple levels of the gene regulatory network (GRN) regulating hindbrain segmentation. Knowing when and how RA became coupled to the core hindbrain GRN is important for understanding how ancient signaling pathways and patterning genes can evolve and generate diversity. Hence, we investigated the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an important jawless vertebrate model providing clues to decipher ancestral vertebrate features. Combining genomics, gene expression, and functional analyses of major components involved in RA synthesis (Aldh1as) and degradation (Cyp26s), we demonstrate that RA signaling is coupled to hindbrain segmentation in lamprey. Thus, the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation is a pan vertebrate feature of the hindbrain and likely evolved at the base of vertebrates.\nJaw size variation is associated with a novel craniofacial function for galanin receptor 2 in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes\nAuthors: Palominos, M. F.; Muhl, V.; Richards, E. J.; Miller, C. T.; Martin, C. H.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543513\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putative Sry transcription factor binding site in the upstream region of galr2 in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 expression among pupfish species in Meckels cartilage and premaxilla using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel function for Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to drugs that inhibit Galr2 activity. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckels cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression of galr2 due to the loss of a putative Sry binding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckels cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a postulated Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions.\nSpecialized mesenteric lymphatic capillaries by-pass the mesenteric lymph node chain to transport peritoneal antigens directly into mediastinal lymph nodes.\nAuthors: Redder, E.; Kirschnick, N.; Fang, S.; Kuhlmann, M.; Gonzalez-Loyola, A.; Wyss, T.; Stehling, M.; Adams, R. H.; Petrova, T. V.; Alitalo, K. K.; Rot, A.; Kiefer, F.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548304\nLymphatic vessels (LVs) are indispensable for tissue fluid homeostasis and immune cell trafficking. The network of LVs that channel fluids from the gut into mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) has been recognized as the sole lymphatic system in the mesentery. Here we describe an alternative, functionally autonomous set of capillary mesenteric LVs (capMLVs) that by-pass the MLNs and drain directly into mediastinal LNs. CapMLVs develop perinatally from valves of collective mesenteric lymphatic vessels (colMLVs) in response to arterial endothelial cell-derived VEGF-C. Once extended, capMLVs detach from colMLVs to form an independent elongated network comprised of LYVE1+, CCL21+ endothelial cells. Avascular areas of the mesentery juxtaposed to capMLVs contain cell islets that express ACKR4. This CCL21-scavenging atypical receptor facilitates the migration of mesenteric phagocytes into capMLVs to be channeled directly into mediastinal LNs. This allows peritoneum-derived ominous antigens to be processed separately from alimentary antigens.\nClonal neural tube organoids self-organise floorplate through BMP-mediated cluster competition\nAuthors: Krammer, T.; Stuart, H.

A.; Elvassore, N.; Siggia, E.; Briscoe, J.; Kicheva, A.; Tanaka, E. M.\nScore: 40.9, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546258\nOrganoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2+ floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2+ clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable \"winning\" floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2+ clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2+ cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.\nAblation of OCT4 function in cattle embryos by double electroporation of CRISPR-Cas for DNA and RNA targeting (CRISPR-DART)\nAuthors: Nix, J. L.; Schettini, G.; Speckhart, S. L.; Ealy, A. D.; Biase, F. H.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548144\nCRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins are important tools for gene editing in pre-implantation embryos. However, the inefficient production of biallelic deletions in cattle zygotes has hindered mechanistic studies of gene function. In addition, the presence of maternal RNAs that support embryo development until embryonic genome activation may cause confounding phenotypes. Here, we aimed to improve the efficiency of biallelic deletions and deplete specific maternal RNAs in cattle zygotes using CRISPR-Cas editing technology. Two electroporation sessions with Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1 and the promoter of OCT4 produced biallelic deletions in 91% of the embryos tested. In most cases, the deletions were longer than 1000 nucleotides long. Electroporation of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins prevents the production of the corresponding proteins. We electroporated Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1, including the promoter region, of OCT4 in two sessions with inclusion of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins targeting OCT4 mRNAs in the second session to ablate OCT4 function in cattle embryos. A lack of OCT4 resulted in embryos arresting development prior to blastocyst formation at a greater proportion (13%) than controls (31.6%, P\u003c0.001). The few embryos that developed past the morula stage did not form a normal inner cell mass. Transcriptome analysis of single blastocysts, confirmed to lack exon 1 and promoter region of OCT4, revealed a significant (FDR\u003c0.1) reduction in transcript abundance of many genes functionally connected to stemness, including markers of pluripotency (CADHD1, DPPA4, GNL3, RRM2). The results confirm that OCT4 is key regulator of genes that modulate pluripotency and is required to form a functional blastocyst in cattle. Significance StatementCRISPR-Cas mediated DNA editing can revolutionize agriculture and biomedicine due to its simplicity of design and use. Modifications induced in embryos, though challenging to accomplish, are beneficial for the advancement of livestock production and the study of biological function. Here, we developed an approach using CRISPR-Cas enzymes to remove DNA segments of the cattle genome in one-cell embryos. Our results show major advancement in the efficiency of producing large deletions in the genome of cattle embryos. Using our approach, we removed the function of the OCT4 gene. Our results confirmed OCT4 as a major regulator of pluripotency genes during embryo development and its requirement for the formation of an inner cell mass in cattle.\nscRNA-seq reveals the diversity of the developing cardiac cell lineage and molecular building blocks of the primary pacemaker\nAuthors: Abu Nahia, K.; Sulej, A.; Migdal, M.; Ochocka, N.; Ho, R.; Kaminska, B.; Zagorski, M.; Winata, C.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-06-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546508\nThe heart is comprised of a variety of specialized cell types that work in unison to maintain blood flow. Here we utilized scRNA-seq analysis to delineate the diversity of cardiac cell types in the zebrafish. With the growing use of the zebrafish to model human heart biology, a deeper insight into its complex cellular composition is critical for a better understanding of heart function, development, and associated malformations. We present a high resolution atlas of zebrafish heart single cells transcriptomics, consisting of over 50 000 cells representing the building blocks of the zebrafish heart at 48 and 72 hpf. We defined 18 discrete cell populations comprising major cell lineages and sublineages of the developing heart. We pinpointed a population of cells likely to be the primary pacemaker and identified the transcriptome profile defining this critical cell type. Our analyses identified two genes, atp1b3b and colec10, which were enriched in the sinoatrial pacemaker cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of these two genes significantly reduced heart rate which is accompanied by arrhythmia or morphological defects, suggesting their novel function in cardiac development and conduction. Additionally, we describe other subpopulations of cardiac cell lineages, including the endothelial and neural cells, whose expression profiles we provide as a resource for further investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this organ.\nIntegrated single-cell multiomics uncovers foundational regulatory mechanisms of lens development and pathology\nAuthors: Tangeman, J. A.; Rebull, S. M.; Grajales-Esquivel, E.; Weaver, J. M.; Bendezu-Sayas, S.; Robinson, M. L.; Lachke, S. A.; Del Rio-Tsonis, K.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548451\nOcular lens development entails epithelial to fiber cell differentiation, defects in which cause congenital cataract. We report the first single-cell multiomic atlas of lens development, leveraging snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and CUT\u0026RUN-seq to discover novel mechanisms of cell fate determination and cataract-linked regulatory networks. A comprehensive profile of cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, including for the cataract-linked transcription factor MAF, is established across a temporal trajectory of fiber cell differentiation. Further, we divulge a conserved epigenetic paradigm of cellular differentiation, defined by progressive loss of H3K27 methylation writer Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 localizes to heterochromatin domains across master-regulator transcription factor gene bodies, suggesting it safeguards epithelial cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that FGF hyper-stimulation in vivo leads to MAF network activation and the emergence of novel lens cell states. Collectively, these data depict a comprehensive portrait of lens fiber cell differentiation, while defining regulatory effectors of cell identity and cataract formation.\nTemporal Dynamics of Apoptosis-Induced Proliferation in Pupal Wing Development: Implications for Regenerative Ability\nAuthors: Ahmed-de-Prado, S.; Estella, C.; Baonza, A.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-07-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548326\nThe ability of animals to regenerate damaged tissue is a complex process that involves various cellular mechanisms. As animals age, they lose their regenerative abilities, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that limit regenerative ability during aging. Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs are epithelial structures that can regenerate after tissue injury. While significant research has focused on investigating regenerative responses during larval stages, particularly regarding the regulation and function of the JNK pathway, our comprehension of the regenerative potential of pupal wings and the underlying mechanisms contributing to the decline of regenerative responses remains limited. This study explores the temporal dynamics during pupal development of the proliferative response triggered by the induction of cell death, a typical regenerative response. Our results indicate that the apoptosis-induced proliferation response can be initiated as late as 30 hours after pupa formation (APF), when in normal circumstances cell proliferation ceases at around 20 hours APF. Furthermore, our data revealed that after 35 hours APF, cell death alone fails to induce further proliferation. Interestingly, the failure of reinitiating the cell cycle beyond this time point is not attributed to an incapacity to activate the JNK pathway. Instead, one of the constraining factors in the apoptotic-induced proliferation process during pupal development seems to be the activity level of ecdysone-responsive genes. Author SummaryAnimals have the remarkable ability to regenerate damaged tissues, but this regenerative potential diminishes with age. Understanding the mechanisms underlying age-related decline in regenerative abilities is crucial. Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs provide a valuable model for studying tissue regeneration. While significant research has focused on regenerative responses during larval stages, our understanding of the regenerative potential and mechanisms in pupal wings remains limited. In this study, we investigate the temporal dynamics of the proliferative response triggered by cell death during late during the development, in pupal development. Our findings reveal that the apoptosis-induced proliferation response can occur during pupal development, even after normal cell proliferation has ceased. However, at late stages of pupal development this response does not occur. We have found that, the inability to reinitiate the cell cycle beyond this time point is influenced by the activity of the hormone ecdysone and its-responsive genes. These findings shed light on the dynamic processes involved in tissue regeneration during pupal development. This study expands our understanding of the complex interplay between cell death, proliferation, and gene activity during tissue regeneration, providing valuable insights for future research in regenerative biology.\nThe transcription factor OCT6 promotes the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state by repressing Nanog and activating a formative state gene regulatory network.\nAuthors: Waisman, A.; Sevlever, F.; Saulnier, D.; Francia, M. G.; Lombardi, A.; Biani, M. C.; Palma, M. B.; Scarafia, A.; Smucler, J.; Amin, G.; La Greca, A.; Moro, L.; Sevlever, G. E.; Guberman, A.; Miriuka, S. G.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548918\nAnimal development relies on complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the nearly irreversible changes that occur during cell differentiation. In this work we aimed to determine key transcription factors (TFs) associated with the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and the acquisition of a formative identity. We identified OCT6 as one of the earliest TFs induced during the onset of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) differentiation. To investigate its role, we generated an Oct6 knockout mESC line, which failed to acquire the characteristic cell morphology associated with the formative state. Transcriptome analysis of differentiating cells revealed nearly 300 differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type cells, including pluripotency TFs Nanog, Klf2, Nr5a2, Prdm14, and Esrrb, that failed to correctly downregulate. Notably, premature expression of OCT6 in naive cells triggered a rapid morphological transformation mirroring differentiation, accompanied by self-induction of Oct6 and expression of TFs such as Sox3, Zic2/3, Foxp1, as well as the formative genes Dnmt3A and FGF5. Strikingly, the majority of OCT6-expressing cells did not express NANOG. Gene expression and single molecule RNA-FISH analysis confirmed that this regulation was at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our results establish OCT6 as a key TF in the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and support a model where Oct6 and Nanog form a double negative feedback loop which could act as a toggle switch important for the transition to the formative state.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species 1. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors 2-5. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Retinoic acid (RA) is involved in antero-posterior patterning of the chordate body axis and, in jawed vertebrates, has been shown to play a major role at multiple levels of the gene regulatory network (GRN) regulating hindbrain segmentation. Knowing when and how RA became coupled to the core hindbrain GRN is important for understanding how ancient signaling pathways and patterning genes can evolve and generate diversity. Hence, we investigated the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an important jawless vertebrate model providing clues to decipher ancestral vertebrate features. Combining genomics, gene expression, and functional analyses of major components involved in RA synthesis (Aldh1as) and degradation (Cyp26s), we demonstrate that RA signaling is coupled to hindbrain segmentation in lamprey. Thus, the link between RA signaling and hindbrain segmentation is a pan vertebrate feature of the hindbrain and likely evolved at the base of vertebrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putative Sry transcription factor binding site in the upstream region of galr2 in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 expression among pupfish species in Meckels cartilage and premaxilla using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel function for Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to drugs that inhibit Galr2 activity. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckels cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression of galr2 due to the loss of a putative Sry binding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckels cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a postulated Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are indispensable for tissue fluid homeostasis and immune cell trafficking. The network of LVs that channel fluids from the gut into mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) has been recognized as the sole lymphatic system in the mesentery. Here we describe an alternative, functionally autonomous set of capillary mesenteric LVs (capMLVs) that by-pass the MLNs and drain directly into mediastinal LNs. CapMLVs develop perinatally from valves of collective mesenteric lymphatic vessels (colMLVs) in response to arterial endothelial cell-derived VEGF-C. Once extended, capMLVs detach from colMLVs to form an independent elongated network comprised of LYVE1&#43;, CCL21&#43; endothelial cells. Avascular areas of the mesentery juxtaposed to capMLVs contain cell islets that express ACKR4. This CCL21-scavenging atypical receptor facilitates the migration of mesenteric phagocytes into capMLVs to be channeled directly into mediastinal LNs. This allows peritoneum-derived ominous antigens to be processed separately from alimentary antigens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organoids can undergo pattern formation by spontaneously forming spatially-localised signaling centers called organisers. Understanding how molecular pathways participate in this regulative process is a central challenge in biology. Here, we investigated self-organisation of a SHH-expressing floorplate in clonal neural tube organoids (NTOs). In NTOs, a pulse of retinoic acid (RA) applied at Day 2 triggers self-organisation of a FOXA2&#43; floorplate by Day 6. FOXA2 expression was initially spatially scattered before resolving into multiple clusters. These FOXA2&#43; clusters underwent competition and physical sorting, resulting in a stable &#34;winning&#34; floorplate. We identified BMP signalling as a key governor of long-range cluster competition. The pathway displayed characteristics of a reaction-diffusion system: FOXA2&#43; clusters secreted BMP4 ligand suppressing FOXA2 in receiving cells, while simultaneously expressing the BMP-inhibitor NOGGIN to secure FOXA2&#43; cluster survival. Genetic deletion of Noggin perturbed the floorplate not only in vitro in NTOs but also in vivo at the mid-hindbrain region of mouse neural tube. These results demonstrate how the floorplate can form in the absence of its well-known inducer, the notochord and the in vivo relevance of these findings. Defining molecular pathways that govern organiser self-organization is an important step in harnessing the developmental plasticity of stem cells toward directed tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins are important tools for gene editing in pre-implantation embryos. However, the inefficient production of biallelic deletions in cattle zygotes has hindered mechanistic studies of gene function. In addition, the presence of maternal RNAs that support embryo development until embryonic genome activation may cause confounding phenotypes. Here, we aimed to improve the efficiency of biallelic deletions and deplete specific maternal RNAs in cattle zygotes using CRISPR-Cas editing technology. Two electroporation sessions with Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1 and the promoter of OCT4 produced biallelic deletions in 91% of the embryos tested. In most cases, the deletions were longer than 1000 nucleotides long. Electroporation of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins prevents the production of the corresponding proteins. We electroporated Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1, including the promoter region, of OCT4 in two sessions with inclusion of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins targeting OCT4 mRNAs in the second session to ablate OCT4 function in cattle embryos. A lack of OCT4 resulted in embryos arresting development prior to blastocyst formation at a greater proportion (13%) than controls (31.6%, P&lt;0.001). The few embryos that developed past the morula stage did not form a normal inner cell mass. Transcriptome analysis of single blastocysts, confirmed to lack exon 1 and promoter region of OCT4, revealed a significant (FDR&lt;0.1) reduction in transcript abundance of many genes functionally connected to stemness, including markers of pluripotency (CADHD1, DPPA4, GNL3, RRM2). The results confirm that OCT4 is key regulator of genes that modulate pluripotency and is required to form a functional blastocyst in cattle.

Significance StatementCRISPR-Cas mediated DNA editing can revolutionize agriculture and biomedicine due to its simplicity of design and use. Modifications induced in embryos, though challenging to accomplish, are beneficial for the advancement of livestock production and the study of biological function. Here, we developed an approach using CRISPR-Cas enzymes to remove DNA segments of the cattle genome in one-cell embryos. Our results show major advancement in the efficiency of producing large deletions in the genome of cattle embryos. Using our approach, we removed the function of the OCT4 gene. Our results confirmed OCT4 as a major regulator of pluripotency genes during embryo development and its requirement for the formation of an inner cell mass in cattle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The heart is comprised of a variety of specialized cell types that work in unison to maintain blood flow. Here we utilized scRNA-seq analysis to delineate the diversity of cardiac cell types in the zebrafish. With the growing use of the zebrafish to model human heart biology, a deeper insight into its complex cellular composition is critical for a better understanding of heart function, development, and associated malformations. We present a high resolution atlas of zebrafish heart single cells transcriptomics, consisting of over 50 000 cells representing the building blocks of the zebrafish heart at 48 and 72 hpf. We defined 18 discrete cell populations comprising major cell lineages and sublineages of the developing heart. We pinpointed a population of cells likely to be the primary pacemaker and identified the transcriptome profile defining this critical cell type. Our analyses identified two genes, atp1b3b and colec10, which were enriched in the sinoatrial pacemaker cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of these two genes significantly reduced heart rate which is accompanied by arrhythmia or morphological defects, suggesting their novel function in cardiac development and conduction. Additionally, we describe other subpopulations of cardiac cell lineages, including the endothelial and neural cells, whose expression profiles we provide as a resource for further investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this organ.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ocular lens development entails epithelial to fiber cell differentiation, defects in which cause congenital cataract. We report the first single-cell multiomic atlas of lens development, leveraging snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and CUT&amp;RUN-seq to discover novel mechanisms of cell fate determination and cataract-linked regulatory networks. A comprehensive profile of cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, including for the cataract-linked transcription factor MAF, is established across a temporal trajectory of fiber cell differentiation. Further, we divulge a conserved epigenetic paradigm of cellular differentiation, defined by progressive loss of H3K27 methylation writer Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 localizes to heterochromatin domains across master-regulator transcription factor gene bodies, suggesting it safeguards epithelial cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that FGF hyper-stimulation in vivo leads to MAF network activation and the emergence of novel lens cell states. Collectively, these data depict a comprehensive portrait of lens fiber cell differentiation, while defining regulatory effectors of cell identity and cataract formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of animals to regenerate damaged tissue is a complex process that involves various cellular mechanisms. As animals age, they lose their regenerative abilities, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that limit regenerative ability during aging. Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs are epithelial structures that can regenerate after tissue injury. While significant research has focused on investigating regenerative responses during larval stages, particularly regarding the regulation and function of the JNK pathway, our comprehension of the regenerative potential of pupal wings and the underlying mechanisms contributing to the decline of regenerative responses remains limited. This study explores the temporal dynamics during pupal development of the proliferative response triggered by the induction of cell death, a typical regenerative response. Our results indicate that the apoptosis-induced proliferation response can be initiated as late as 30 hours after pupa formation (APF), when in normal circumstances cell proliferation ceases at around 20 hours APF. Furthermore, our data revealed that after 35 hours APF, cell death alone fails to induce further proliferation. Interestingly, the failure of reinitiating the cell cycle beyond this time point is not attributed to an incapacity to activate the JNK pathway. Instead, one of the constraining factors in the apoptotic-induced proliferation process during pupal development seems to be the activity level of ecdysone-responsive genes.

Author SummaryAnimals have the remarkable ability to regenerate damaged tissues, but this regenerative potential diminishes with age. Understanding the mechanisms underlying age-related decline in regenerative abilities is crucial. Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs provide a valuable model for studying tissue regeneration. While significant research has focused on regenerative responses during larval stages, our understanding of the regenerative potential and mechanisms in pupal wings remains limited.

In this study, we investigate the temporal dynamics of the proliferative response triggered by cell death during late during the development, in pupal development. Our findings reveal that the apoptosis-induced proliferation response can occur during pupal development, even after normal cell proliferation has ceased. However, at late stages of pupal development this response does not occur. We have found that, the inability to reinitiate the cell cycle beyond this time point is influenced by the activity of the hormone ecdysone and its-responsive genes.

These findings shed light on the dynamic processes involved in tissue regeneration during pupal development. This study expands our understanding of the complex interplay between cell death, proliferation, and gene activity during tissue regeneration, providing valuable insights for future research in regenerative biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal development relies on complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the nearly irreversible changes that occur during cell differentiation. In this work we aimed to determine key transcription factors (TFs) associated with the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and the acquisition of a formative identity. We identified OCT6 as one of the earliest TFs induced during the onset of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) differentiation. To investigate its role, we generated an Oct6 knockout mESC line, which failed to acquire the characteristic cell morphology associated with the formative state. Transcriptome analysis of differentiating cells revealed nearly 300 differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type cells, including pluripotency TFs Nanog, Klf2, Nr5a2, Prdm14, and Esrrb, that failed to correctly downregulate. Notably, premature expression of OCT6 in naive cells triggered a rapid morphological transformation mirroring differentiation, accompanied by self-induction of Oct6 and expression of TFs such as Sox3, Zic2/3, Foxp1, as well as the formative genes Dnmt3A and FGF5. Strikingly, the majority of OCT6-expressing cells did not express NANOG. Gene expression and single molecule RNA-FISH analysis confirmed that this regulation was at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our results establish OCT6 as a key TF in the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and support a model where Oct6 and Nanog form a double negative feedback loop which could act as a toggle switch important for the transition to the formative state.</p>
