A.; Sundstrom, E.; Posthuma, D.; Linnarsson, S.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553878\nThe human brain is capable of highly complex functions that develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, expressed transcription factors and changes in chromatin accessibility. While extensive datasets exist describing gene expression across the developing brain with single-cell resolution, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain. Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million nuclei and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.\nReversal of Biological Age in Multiple Rat Organs by Young Porcine Plasma Fraction\nAuthors: Horvath, S.; Singh, K.; Raj, K.; Khairnar, S.; Sanghavi, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Zoller, J. A.; Li, C. Z.; Herenu, C. B.; Canatelli-Mallat, M.; Lehmann, M.; Habazin, S.; Vuckovic, F.; Solberg-Woods, L.; Garcia Martinez, A.; Wang, T.; Chiavellini, P.; Levine, A. J.; Chen, H.; Brooke, R. T.; Gordevicius, J.; Lauc, G.; Goya, R. G.; Katcher, H. L.\nScore: 51.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552148\nYoung blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.\nHow a reaction-diffusion signal can control spinal cord regeneration in axolotls: A modelling study\nAuthors: Caliaro, V.; Peurichard, D.; Chara, O.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.554065\nAxolotls are uniquely able to completely regenerate the spinal cord after amputation. The underlying governing mechanisms of this regenerative response have not yet been fully elucidated. We previously found that spinal cord regeneration is mainly driven by cell cycle acceleration of ependymal cells, recruited by a hypothetical signal propagating from the injury. However, the nature of the signal and its propagation remain unknown. In this theoretical study, we investigated whether the regeneration-inducing signal can follow a reaction-diffusion process. We developed a computational model, validated it with experimental data and showed that the signal dynamics can be understood in terms of reaction-diffusion mechanism. By developing a theory of the regenerating outgrowth in the limit of fast reaction-diffusion, we demonstrate that control of regenerative response solely relies on cell-to-signal sensitivity and the signal reaction-diffusion characteristic length. This study lays foundations for further identification of the signal controlling regeneration of the spinal cord.\nPrimate-expressed EPIREGULIN promotes basal progenitor proliferation in the developing neocortex\nAuthors: Cubillos, P.; Ditzer, N.; Kolodziejczyk, A.; Schwenk, G.; Hoffmann, J.; Schütze, T. M.; Derihaci, R. P.; Birdir, C.; Köllner, J. E. M.; Petzold, A.; Sarov, M.; Martin, U.; Long, K. R.; Wimberger, P.; Albert, M.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554446\nNeocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.\nFOXL2 interaction with different binding partners regulates the dynamics of ovarian development\nAuthors: Migale, R.; Neumann, M.; Mitter, R.; Rafiee, M.-R.; Wood, S.; Olsen, J.; Lovell-Badge, R.\nScore: 24.2, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.04.14.536403\nThe transcription factor FOXL2 is required in ovarian somatic cells for female fertility. Differential timing of Foxl2 deletion, in embryonic versus adult mouse ovary, leads to distinctive outcomes suggesting different roles across development. Here, we comprehensively investigated FOXL2 role through a multi-omics approach to characterise gene expression dynamics and chromatin accessibility changes, coupled with genome-wide identification of FOXL2 targets and on-chromatin interacting partners in granulosa cells across ovarian development. We found that FOXL2 regulates more targets postnatally, through interaction with factors regulating primordial follicle activation (PFA) and steroidogenesis. Deletion of one interactor, Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), induces PFA blockage, impaired ovary development and sterility. Our datasets constitute a comprehensive resource for exploration of the molecular mechanisms of ovarian development and causes of female infertility.\nThe molecular basis of macrochaete diversification highlighted by a single-cell atlas of Bicyclus anynana butterfly pupal forewings\nAuthors: Prakash, A.; Dion, E.; Monteiro, A.\nScore: 10.3, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554425\nButterfly wings display a large diversity of cell types, including scale cells of different colors, shapes, and sizes, yet the molecular basis of such diversity is poorly understood. Scales are single-cellular projections homologous to sensory bristles in other arthropods, and different scale types are often found intermingled on the wing, alongside other sensory and epidermal cell types, making the analysis of the complete transcriptomes of each scale type difficult to achieve. To explore scale cell diversity at a transcriptomic level we employed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~5200 large cells (\u003e6 um) from 22.5-25-hour male pupal forewings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Using single-cell unsupervised, transcriptome clustering, based on shared and differentially expressed genes, followed by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and CRISPR/Cas9 editing of candidate cell type specific genes, we annotate various cell types on the wing. We identify the molecular identities of non-innervated scale cells at various stages of differentiation, innervated sensory cell types, and pheromone producing glandular cells. We further show that senseless, a zinc finger transcription factor, and HR38, a hormone receptor, determine the identity, size, and color of different scale cell types and are important regulators of scale cell differentiation.\nA conserved fertilization complex of Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 mediates sperm-egg interaction in vertebrates\nAuthors: Deneke, V. E.; Blaha, A.; Lu, Y.; Draper, J. M.; Phan, C. S.; Panser, K.; Schleiffer, A.; Jacob, L.; Humer, T.; Stejskal, K.; Krssakova, G.; Handler, D.; Kamoshita, M.; Vance, T. D. R.; Roitinger, E.; Lee, J. E.; Ikawa, M.; Pauli, A.\nScore: 46.0, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550750\nFertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.\nVolumetric trans-scale imaging of massive quantity of heterogeneous cell populations in centimeter-wide tissue and embryo\nAuthors: Ichimura, T.; Kakizuka, T.; Sato, Y.; Itano, K.; Seiriki, K.; Hashimoto, H.; Itoga, H.; Onami, S.; Nagai, T.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553997\nWe established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of 2x and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 {micro}m across an FOV of approximately 1.5 x 1.0 cm2. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 x 105 vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.\nLineage-based scaling of germline intercellular bridges during oogenesis\nAuthors: Shaikh, U.; Sherlock, K.; Wilson, J.; Gilliland, W.; Lewellyn, L.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553876\nThe size of subcellular structures must be tightly controlled to maintain normal cell function; this is especially important when cells are part of developing tissues or organs. Despite its importance, few studies have determined how the size of organelles or other structures is maintained during tissue growth, when cells are growing, dividing, and rearranging. The developing egg chamber is a powerful model in which to study the relative growth rates of subcellular structures. The egg chamber contains a cluster of sixteen germ cells, which are connected through intercellular bridges called ring canals. Ring canals are formed following incomplete cytokinesis after each of four germ cell divisions. As the egg chamber grows, the nurse cells and the ring canals that connect them increase in size. Here, we demonstrate that ring canal size scaling is related to their lineage; the largest, \"first born\" ring canals grow at a relatively slower rate than ring canals derived from subsequent mitotic divisions. This lineage-based scaling relationship is maintained even if directed transport is reduced, ring canal size is altered, or if the germ cells go through an additional mitotic division. Further, we propose that changes in ring canal scaling could provide a mechanism to alter egg size.\nTrabeculations of the porcine and human cardiac ventricles are different in number but similar in total volume.\nAuthors: Jensen, B.; Salvatori, D.; Schouten, J.; Meijborg, V. M.; Lauridsen, H.; Agger, P.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553743\nAn intricate meshwork of trabeculations lines the luminal side of cardiac ventricles. Compaction, a developmental process, is thought to reduce trabeculations by adding them to the neighboring compact wall which is then enlarged. When pig, a plausible cardiac donor for xenotransplantation, is compared to human, the ventricular walls appear to have fewer trabeculations. We hypothesized the trabecular volume is proportionally smaller in pig than in human. Macroscopically, we observed in sixteen pig hearts that the ventricular walls harbor few but large trabeculations. Close inspection revealed a high number of tiny trabeculations, a few hundred, within the recesses of the large trabeculations. While tiny, these were still larger than embryonic trabeculations and even when considering their number, the total tally of trabeculations in pig was much fewer than in human. Volumetrics based on high-resolution MRI of additional six pig hearts compared to six human hearts, revealed the left ventricles were not significantly differently trabeculated (21.5 versus 22.8%, respectively), and the porcine right ventricles were only slightly less trabeculated (42.1 versus 49.3%, respectively). We then analyzed volumetrically ten pig embryonic hearts from gestational day 14 to 35. The trabecular and compact layer always grew, as did the intertrabecular recesses, in contrast to what compaction predicts. The proportions of the trabecular and compact layers changed substantially, nonetheless, due to differences in their growth rate rather than compaction. In conclusion, processes that affect the trabecular morphology do not necessarily affect the proportion of trabecular-to-compact myocardium and they are then distinct from compaction.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The human brain is capable of highly complex functions that develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, expressed transcription factors and changes in chromatin accessibility. While extensive datasets exist describing gene expression across the developing brain with single-cell resolution, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain. Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million nuclei and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Axolotls are uniquely able to completely regenerate the spinal cord after amputation. The underlying governing mechanisms of this regenerative response have not yet been fully elucidated. We previously found that spinal cord regeneration is mainly driven by cell cycle acceleration of ependymal cells, recruited by a hypothetical signal propagating from the injury. However, the nature of the signal and its propagation remain unknown. In this theoretical study, we investigated whether the regeneration-inducing signal can follow a reaction-diffusion process. We developed a computational model, validated it with experimental data and showed that the signal dynamics can be understood in terms of reaction-diffusion mechanism. By developing a theory of the regenerating outgrowth in the limit of fast reaction-diffusion, we demonstrate that control of regenerative response solely relies on cell-to-signal sensitivity and the signal reaction-diffusion characteristic length. This study lays foundations for further identification of the signal controlling regeneration of the spinal cord.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transcription factor FOXL2 is required in ovarian somatic cells for female fertility. Differential timing of Foxl2 deletion, in embryonic versus adult mouse ovary, leads to distinctive outcomes suggesting different roles across development. Here, we comprehensively investigated FOXL2 role through a multi-omics approach to characterise gene expression dynamics and chromatin accessibility changes, coupled with genome-wide identification of FOXL2 targets and on-chromatin interacting partners in granulosa cells across ovarian development. We found that FOXL2 regulates more targets postnatally, through interaction with factors regulating primordial follicle activation (PFA) and steroidogenesis. Deletion of one interactor, Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), induces PFA blockage, impaired ovary development and sterility. Our datasets constitute a comprehensive resource for exploration of the molecular mechanisms of ovarian development and causes of female infertility.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Butterfly wings display a large diversity of cell types, including scale cells of different colors, shapes, and sizes, yet the molecular basis of such diversity is poorly understood. Scales are single-cellular projections homologous to sensory bristles in other arthropods, and different scale types are often found intermingled on the wing, alongside other sensory and epidermal cell types, making the analysis of the complete transcriptomes of each scale type difficult to achieve. To explore scale cell diversity at a transcriptomic level we employed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~5200 large cells (&gt;6 um) from 22.5-25-hour male pupal forewings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Using single-cell unsupervised, transcriptome clustering, based on shared and differentially expressed genes, followed by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and CRISPR/Cas9 editing of candidate cell type specific genes, we annotate various cell types on the wing. We identify the molecular identities of non-innervated scale cells at various stages of differentiation, innervated sensory cell types, and pheromone producing glandular cells. We further show that senseless, a zinc finger transcription factor, and HR38, a hormone receptor, determine the identity, size, and color of different scale cell types and are important regulators of scale cell differentiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg, is essential for sexual reproduction. While several proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for the binding and fusion of gametes in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms driving this key process are poorly understood. Here, we performed a protein interaction screen using AlphaFold-Multimer to uncover protein-protein interactions in fertilization. This screen resulted in the prediction of a trimeric complex composed of the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6, and Tmem81, a protein previously not implicated in fertilization. We show that Tmem81 is a conserved, testis-expressed transmembrane protein that is evolutionarily related to Izumo1 and Spaca6 and is essential for male fertility in fish and mice. Consistent with trimer formation in vivo, zebrafish izumo1-/-, spaca6-/-, and tmem81-/- mutants exhibit the same sperm-egg binding defect and show co-depletion of all three proteins in sperm. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm. Strikingly, the Izumo1-Spaca6 interaction is predicted to form a cleft that serves as a binding site for Bouncer, the only identified egg protein essential for fertilization in zebrafish. Together, these results provide compelling evidence for a conserved sperm factor complex in vertebrates that forms a specific interface for the sperm-egg interaction required for successful fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of 2x and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 {micro}m across an FOV of approximately 1.5 x 1.0 cm2. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 x 105 vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The size of subcellular structures must be tightly controlled to maintain normal cell function; this is especially important when cells are part of developing tissues or organs. Despite its importance, few studies have determined how the size of organelles or other structures is maintained during tissue growth, when cells are growing, dividing, and rearranging. The developing egg chamber is a powerful model in which to study the relative growth rates of subcellular structures. The egg chamber contains a cluster of sixteen germ cells, which are connected through intercellular bridges called ring canals. Ring canals are formed following incomplete cytokinesis after each of four germ cell divisions. As the egg chamber grows, the nurse cells and the ring canals that connect them increase in size. Here, we demonstrate that ring canal size scaling is related to their lineage; the largest, &#34;first born&#34; ring canals grow at a relatively slower rate than ring canals derived from subsequent mitotic divisions. This lineage-based scaling relationship is maintained even if directed transport is reduced, ring canal size is altered, or if the germ cells go through an additional mitotic division. Further, we propose that changes in ring canal scaling could provide a mechanism to alter egg size.</p>

        <p class="abstract">An intricate meshwork of trabeculations lines the luminal side of cardiac ventricles. Compaction, a developmental process, is thought to reduce trabeculations by adding them to the neighboring compact wall which is then enlarged. When pig, a plausible cardiac donor for xenotransplantation, is compared to human, the ventricular walls appear to have fewer trabeculations. We hypothesized the trabecular volume is proportionally smaller in pig than in human. Macroscopically, we observed in sixteen pig hearts that the ventricular walls harbor few but large trabeculations. Close inspection revealed a high number of tiny trabeculations, a few hundred, within the recesses of the large trabeculations. While tiny, these were still larger than embryonic trabeculations and even when considering their number, the total tally of trabeculations in pig was much fewer than in human. Volumetrics based on high-resolution MRI of additional six pig hearts compared to six human hearts, revealed the left ventricles were not significantly differently trabeculated (21.5 versus 22.8%, respectively), and the porcine right ventricles were only slightly less trabeculated (42.1 versus 49.3%, respectively). We then analyzed volumetrically ten pig embryonic hearts from gestational day 14 to 35. The trabecular and compact layer always grew, as did the intertrabecular recesses, in contrast to what compaction predicts. The proportions of the trabecular and compact layers changed substantially, nonetheless, due to differences in their growth rate rather than compaction. In conclusion, processes that affect the trabecular morphology do not necessarily affect the proportion of trabecular-to-compact myocardium and they are then distinct from compaction.</p>
