R.; Tassou, A.; Geron, M.; Scherrer, G.; O'Brien, L. L.\nScore: 101.5, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567276\nThe kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)+, substance P+, Trpv1+, and Piezo2+, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2+ sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.\nThe regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs in translational control during zebrafish embryogenesis\nAuthors: M. Reimao-Pinto, M.; Castillo-Hair, S. M.; Seelig, G.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 34.7, Published: 2023-11-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.568470\nThe 5' UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5' UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5' UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5' UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5' UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5' UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5' UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5' UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.

They undergo gastrulation-like processes leading to the self-organization into highly reproducible biological objects. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this remarkable property. We report that self-organization competence is associated with a cell-specific coordination of a Cadherin switch. We find that N-Cadherin hinders gastruloids morphogenetic competence, for its inactivation leads to the formation of trunk-like structures in absence of extra-cellular matrix analogues. In contrast, E-Cadherin repression by Snai1 is critical for self-organization: Snai1 establishes a cell-specific repressive pace by triggering the repression of a pluripotency-associated transcription program and its chromatin landscape, thus allowing a proper transition from E- to N-Cadherin to occur. Altogether, this work establishes a molecular mechanism that integrates the exit from pluripotency and the pace of cell differentiation, leading to the observed self-organizing potential of gastruloids.\nNephron progenitors rhythmically alternate between renewal and differentiation in synchrony with kidney branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Davis, S. N.; Grindel, S. H.; Viola, J. M.; Liu, G. Y.; Liu, J.; Qian, G.; Porter, C. M.; Hughes, A. J.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-11-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568157\nThe mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.\nModelling variability and heterogeneity of EMT scenarios highlights nuclear positioning and protrusions as main drivers of extrusion\nAuthors: Plunder, S.; Danesin, C.; Glise, B.; Ferreira, M. A.; Merino Aceituno, S.; THEVENEAU, E.\nScore: 11.8, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.17.567510\nEpithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a key process in physiological and pathological settings (i.e. development, fibrosis, cancer). EMT is often presented as a linear sequence of events including (i) disassembly of cell-cell junctions, (ii) loss of epithelial polarity and (iii) reorganization of the cytoskeleton leading to basal extrusion from the epithelium. Once out, cells can adopt a migratory phenotype with a front-rear polarity and may additionally become invasive. While this stereotyped sequence can occur, many in vivo observations have challenged this notion. It is now accepted that there are multiple EMT scenarios and that cell populations implementing EMT are often heterogeneous. However, the relative importance of each EMT step towards extrusion is unclear. Similarly, the overall impact of variability and heterogeneity on the efficiency and directionality of cell extrusion has not been assessed. Here we used computational modelling of a pseudostratified epithelium to model multiple EMT-like scenarios. We confronted these in silico data to the EMT occurring during neural crest delamination. Overall, our simulated and biological data point to a key role of nuclear positioning and protrusive activity to generate timely basal extrusion of cells and suggest a non-linear model of EMT allowing multiple scenarios to co-exist.\nFormation of recurring transient Ca2+-based intercellular communities during Drosophila hematopoiesis\nAuthors: Ben David, S.; Ho, K. Y. L.; Tanentzapf, G.; Zaritsky, A.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-11-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.568594\nTissue development occurs through a complex interplay between many individual cells. Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development. We demonstrated this intermediate scale of emergent signaling using Ca2+ signaling in the intact, ex vivo cultured, live developing Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG). Recurrent activation of these transient signaling communities defined self-organized signaling \"hotspots\" that receive and transmit information to facilitate repetitive interactions with non-hotspot neighbors, transfer information across cells, and regulate the developmental progression of hotspots. Overall, this work bridges the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior providing key mechanistic insight into how cells establish tissue-scale communication networks. Significance statementCells coordinate their internal state and behavior by exchanging information with other cells in their vicinity. These local interactions are integrated across space and time to enable synchronized function at the tissue scale. Using live microscopy imaging of the Drosophila Lymph Gland, and by applying computational analyses, we identified and characterized a new mode of cellular communication through self-organized recurring coordinated short-term activation at the intermediate scale of 3-8 cells, which we call \"hotspots\". We reveal that hotspots form over the course of tissue development, and are dependent on specific proteins, called gap-junctions, that enable communication between adjacent cells. Hotspots repeatedly transmit and retrieve information to and from their non-hotspot neighbors to spread information throughout the tissue to regulate and coordinate tissue function.\nMating-induced ecdysone in the testis disrupts soma-germline contacts and stem cell cytokinesis\nAuthors: Roach, T. V.; Lenhart, K. F.\nScore: 15.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562562\nGermline maintenance relies on adult stem cells to continually replenish lost gametes over a lifetime and respond to external cues altering the demands on the tissue. Mating worsens germline homeostasis over time, yet a negative impact on stem cell behavior has not been explored. Using extended live imaging of the Drosophila testis stem cell niche, we find that short periods of mating in young males disrupts cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs). This defect leads to failure of abscission, preventing release of differentiating cells from the niche. We find that GSC abscission failure is caused by increased ecdysone hormone signaling induced upon mating, which leads to disrupted somatic encystment of the germline. Abscission failure is rescued by isolating males from females but recurs with resumption of mating. Importantly, reiterative mating also leads to increased GSC loss, requiring increased restoration of stem cells via symmetric renewal and de-differentiation. Together, these results suggest a model whereby acute mating results in hormonal changes that negatively impact GSC cytokinesis but preserves the stem cell population.

F.; Antony, J.; Horsfield, J. A.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-11-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.21.568176\nCohesin, a chromatin-associated protein complex with four core subunits (Smc1a, Smc3, Rad21 and either Stag1 or 2), has a central role in cell proliferation and gene expression in metazoans. Human developmental disorders termed \"cohesinopathies\" are characterised by germline mutations in cohesin or its regulators that do not entirely eliminate cohesin function. However, it is not clear if mutations in individual cohesin subunits have independent developmental consequences. Here we show that zebrafish rad21 or stag2 mutants independently influence embryonic tailbud development. Both mutants have altered mesoderm induction, but only homozygous or heterozygous rad21 mutation affects cell cycle gene expression. stag2 mutants have narrower notochords and reduced Wnt signaling in neuromesodermal progenitors as revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing. Stimulation of Wnt signaling rescues transcription and morphology in stag2, but not rad21 mutants. Our results suggest that mutations altering the quantity versus composition of cohesin have independent developmental consequences, with implications for the understanding and management of cohesinopathies. TeaserViable zebrafish mutants show that cohesin complex quantity versus composition lead to different transcriptional and developmental outcomes in the early embryo.\nMicroinjection, gene knockdown, and CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in in the hard coral, Astrangia poculata\nAuthors: Warner, J. F.; Besemer, R.; Schickle, A.; Changsut, I. V.; Borbee, E.; Sharp, K.; Babonis, L. S.\nScore: 41.4, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.16.567385\nCnidarians have become valuable models for understanding many aspects of developmental biology including the evolution of body plan diversity, novel cell type specification, and regeneration. Most of our understanding of gene function during early development in cnidarians comes from a small number of experimental systems including the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Few molecular tools have been developed for use in hard corals, limiting our understanding of this diverse and ecologically important clade. Here, we report the development of a suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing gene expression during early development in the northern star coral, Astrangia poculata. We present methods for gene knockdown using short hairpin RNAs, gene overexpression using exogenous mRNAs, and endogenous gene tagging using CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in. Combined with our ability to control spawning in the laboratory, these tools make A. poculata a tractable experimental system for investigative studies of coral development. Further application of these tools will enable functional analyses of embryonic patterning and morphogenesis across Anthozoa and open new frontiers in coral biology research. Summary StatementThis study reports the development of the first transgenic knock-in coral, providing the opportunity to track the behavior of various cell types during early coral development.\nFeedback control of organ size precision is mediated by BMP2-regulated apoptosis in the Drosophila eye\nAuthors: Navarro, T.; Iannini, A.; Neto, M.; Campoy-Lopez, A.; Munoz-Garcia, J.; Pereira, P. S.; Ares, S.; Casares, F.\nScore: 17.6, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.02.530805\nBiological processes are intrinsically noisy and yet, the result of development -like the species-specific size and shape of organs- is usually remarkably precise. This precision suggests the existence of mechanisms of feedback control that ensure that deviations from a target size are minimized. Still, we have very limited understanding of how these mechanisms operate. Here, we investigate the problem of organ size precision using the Drosophila eye. The size of the adult eye depends on the rates at which eye progenitor cells grow and differentiate. We first find that the progenitor net growth rate results from the balance between their proliferation and apoptosis, with this latter contributing to determining both final eye size and its variability. In turn, apoptosis of progenitor cells is hampered by Dpp, a BMP2/4 signaling molecule transiently produced by early differentiating retinal cells. Our genetic and computational experiments show how the status of retinal differentiation is communicated to progenitors through the differentiation-dependent production of Dpp which, by adjusting the rate of apoptosis, exerts a feedback control over the net growth of progenitors to reduce final eye size variability.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The kidney functions as a finely tuned sensor to balance body fluid composition and filter out waste through complex coordinated mechanisms. This versatility requires tight neural control, with innervating efferent nerves playing a crucial role in regulating blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, water and sodium reabsorption, and renin release. In turn sensory afferents provide feedback to the central nervous system for the modulation of cardiovascular function. However, the cells targeted by sensory afferents and the physiological sensing mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Moreover, how the kidney is innervated during development to establish these functions remains elusive. Here, we utilized a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy to generate anatomical maps of kidney sensory and sympathetic nerves throughout development and resolve the establishment of functional crosstalk. Our analyses revealed that kidney innervation initiates at embryonic day (E)13.5 as the nerves associate with vascular smooth muscle cells and follow arterial differentiation. By E17.5 axonal projections associate with kidney structures such as glomeruli and tubules and the network continue to expand postnatally. These nerves are synapsin I-positive, highlighting ongoing axonogenesis and the potential for functional crosstalk. We show that sensory and sympathetic nerves innervate the kidney concomitantly and classify the sensory fibers as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)&#43;, substance P&#43;, Trpv1&#43;, and Piezo2&#43;, establishing the presence of Piezo2 mechanosensory fibers in the kidney. Using retrograde tracing, we identified the primary dorsal root ganglia, T10-L2, from which Piezo2&#43; sensory afferents project to the kidney. Taken together our findings elucidate the temporality of kidney innervation and resolve the identity of kidney sympathetic and sensory nerves.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The 5&#39; UTRs of mRNAs are critical for translation regulation, but their in vivo regulatory features are poorly characterized. Here, we report the regulatory landscape of 5&#39; UTRs during early zebrafish embryogenesis using a massively parallel reporter assay of 18,154 sequences coupled to polysome profiling. We found that the 5&#39; UTR is sufficient to confer temporal dynamics to translation initiation, and identified 86 motifs enriched in 5&#39; UTRs with distinct ribosome recruitment capabilities. A quantitative deep learning model, DaniO5P, revealed a combined role for 5&#39; UTR length, translation initiation site context, upstream AUGs and sequence motifs on in vivo ribosome recruitment. DaniO5P predicts the activities of 5&#39; UTR isoforms and indicates that modulating 5&#39; UTR length and motif grammar contributes to translation initiation dynamics. This study provides a first quantitative model of 5&#39; UTR-based translation regulation in early vertebrate development and lays the foundation for identifying the underlying molecular effectors.

        <p class="abstract">Gastruloids have recently emerged as an efficient four-dimensional model for studying some aspects of post-implantation embryonic patterning. They undergo gastrulation-like processes leading to the self-organization into highly reproducible biological objects. Here, we sought to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying this remarkable property. We report that self-organization competence is associated with a cell-specific coordination of a Cadherin switch. We find that N-Cadherin hinders gastruloids morphogenetic competence, for its inactivation leads to the formation of trunk-like structures in absence of extra-cellular matrix analogues. In contrast, E-Cadherin repression by Snai1 is critical for self-organization: Snai1 establishes a cell-specific repressive pace by triggering the repression of a pluripotency-associated transcription program and its chromatin landscape, thus allowing a proper transition from E- to N-Cadherin to occur. Altogether, this work establishes a molecular mechanism that integrates the exit from pluripotency and the pace of cell differentiation, leading to the observed self-organizing potential of gastruloids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mammalian kidney achieves massive parallelization of function by exponentially duplicating nephron-forming niches during development. Each niche caps a tip of the ureteric bud epithelium (the future urinary collecting duct tree) as it undergoes branching morphogenesis, while nephron progenitors within niches balance self-renewal and differentiation to early nephron cells. Nephron formation rate approximately matches branching rate over a large fraction of mouse gestation, yet the nature of this apparent pace-maker is unknown. Here we correlate spatial transcriptomics data with branching  life-cycle to discover rhythmically alternating signatures of nephron progenitor differentiation and renewal across Wnt, retinoic acid (RA), Hippo-Yap and other pathways. We then reveal stark differences in progenitor renewal vs. differentiation rates depending on whether Yap is activated in- or out-of-phase with Wnt/{beta}-catenin-induced differentiation of human stem-cell derived nephron progenitor organoids. Our data brings temporal resolution to the renewal vs. differentiation balance in the nephrogenic niche, and informs new strategies to achieve self-sustaining niches in synthetic human kidney tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a key process in physiological and pathological settings (i.e. development, fibrosis, cancer). EMT is often presented as a linear sequence of events including (i) disassembly of cell-cell junctions, (ii) loss of epithelial polarity and (iii) reorganization of the cytoskeleton leading to basal extrusion from the epithelium. Once out, cells can adopt a migratory phenotype with a front-rear polarity and may additionally become invasive. While this stereotyped sequence can occur, many in vivo observations have challenged this notion. It is now accepted that there are multiple EMT scenarios and that cell populations implementing EMT are often heterogeneous. However, the relative importance of each EMT step towards extrusion is unclear. Similarly, the overall impact of variability and heterogeneity on the efficiency and directionality of cell extrusion has not been assessed. Here we used computational modelling of a pseudostratified epithelium to model multiple EMT-like scenarios. We confronted these in silico data to the EMT occurring during neural crest delamination. Overall, our simulated and biological data point to a key role of nuclear positioning and protrusive activity to generate timely basal extrusion of cells and suggest a non-linear model of EMT allowing multiple scenarios to co-exist.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue development occurs through a complex interplay between many individual cells. Yet, the fundamental question of how collective tissue behavior emerges from heterogeneous and noisy information processing and transfer at the single-cell level remains unknown. Here, we reveal that tissue scale signaling regulation can arise from local gap-junction mediated cell-cell signaling through the spatiotemporal establishment of an intermediate-scale of transient multicellular communication communities over the course of tissue development. We demonstrated this intermediate scale of emergent signaling using Ca2&#43; signaling in the intact, ex vivo cultured, live developing Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the Lymph Gland (LG). Recurrent activation of these transient signaling communities defined self-organized signaling &#34;hotspots&#34; that receive and transmit information to facilitate repetitive interactions with non-hotspot neighbors, transfer information across cells, and regulate the developmental progression of hotspots. Overall, this work bridges the scales between single-cell and emergent group behavior providing key mechanistic insight into how cells establish tissue-scale communication networks.

Significance statementCells coordinate their internal state and behavior by exchanging information with other cells in their vicinity. These local interactions are integrated across space and time to enable synchronized function at the tissue scale. Using live microscopy imaging of the Drosophila Lymph Gland, and by applying computational analyses, we identified and characterized a new mode of cellular communication through self-organized recurring coordinated short-term activation at the intermediate scale of 3-8 cells, which we call &#34;hotspots&#34;. We reveal that hotspots form over the course of tissue development, and are dependent on specific proteins, called gap-junctions, that enable communication between adjacent cells. Hotspots repeatedly transmit and retrieve information to and from their non-hotspot neighbors to spread information throughout the tissue to regulate and coordinate tissue function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germline maintenance relies on adult stem cells to continually replenish lost gametes over a lifetime and respond to external cues altering the demands on the tissue. Mating worsens germline homeostasis over time, yet a negative impact on stem cell behavior has not been explored. Using extended live imaging of the Drosophila testis stem cell niche, we find that short periods of mating in young males disrupts cytokinesis in germline stem cells (GSCs). This defect leads to failure of abscission, preventing release of differentiating cells from the niche. We find that GSC abscission failure is caused by increased ecdysone hormone signaling induced upon mating, which leads to disrupted somatic encystment of the germline. Abscission failure is rescued by isolating males from females but recurs with resumption of mating. Importantly, reiterative mating also leads to increased GSC loss, requiring increased restoration of stem cells via symmetric renewal and de-differentiation. Together, these results suggest a model whereby acute mating results in hormonal changes that negatively impact GSC cytokinesis but preserves the stem cell population.

        <p class="abstract">Cohesin, a chromatin-associated protein complex with four core subunits (Smc1a, Smc3, Rad21 and either Stag1 or 2), has a central role in cell proliferation and gene expression in metazoans. Human developmental disorders termed &#34;cohesinopathies&#34; are characterised by germline mutations in cohesin or its regulators that do not entirely eliminate cohesin function. However, it is not clear if mutations in individual cohesin subunits have independent developmental consequences. Here we show that zebrafish rad21 or stag2 mutants independently influence embryonic tailbud development. Both mutants have altered mesoderm induction, but only homozygous or heterozygous rad21 mutation affects cell cycle gene expression. stag2 mutants have narrower notochords and reduced Wnt signaling in neuromesodermal progenitors as revealed by single cell RNA-sequencing.

Stimulation of Wnt signaling rescues transcription and morphology in stag2, but not rad21 mutants. Our results suggest that mutations altering the quantity versus composition of cohesin have independent developmental consequences, with implications for the understanding and management of cohesinopathies.

TeaserViable zebrafish mutants show that cohesin complex quantity versus composition lead to different transcriptional and developmental outcomes in the early embryo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cnidarians have become valuable models for understanding many aspects of developmental biology including the evolution of body plan diversity, novel cell type specification, and regeneration. Most of our understanding of gene function during early development in cnidarians comes from a small number of experimental systems including the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Few molecular tools have been developed for use in hard corals, limiting our understanding of this diverse and ecologically important clade. Here, we report the development of a suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing gene expression during early development in the northern star coral, Astrangia poculata. We present methods for gene knockdown using short hairpin RNAs, gene overexpression using exogenous mRNAs, and endogenous gene tagging using CRISPR-mediated gene knock-in. Combined with our ability to control spawning in the laboratory, these tools make A. poculata a tractable experimental system for investigative studies of coral development. Further application of these tools will enable functional analyses of embryonic patterning and morphogenesis across Anthozoa and open new frontiers in coral biology research.

Summary StatementThis study reports the development of the first transgenic knock-in coral, providing the opportunity to track the behavior of various cell types during early coral development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological processes are intrinsically noisy and yet, the result of development -like the species-specific size and shape of organs- is usually remarkably precise. This precision suggests the existence of mechanisms of feedback control that ensure that deviations from a target size are minimized. Still, we have very limited understanding of how these mechanisms operate. Here, we investigate the problem of organ size precision using the Drosophila eye. The size of the adult eye depends on the rates at which eye progenitor cells grow and differentiate. We first find that the progenitor net growth rate results from the balance between their proliferation and apoptosis, with this latter contributing to determining both final eye size and its variability. In turn, apoptosis of progenitor cells is hampered by Dpp, a BMP2/4 signaling molecule transiently produced by early differentiating retinal cells. Our genetic and computational experiments show how the status of retinal differentiation is communicated to progenitors through the differentiation-dependent production of Dpp which, by adjusting the rate of apoptosis, exerts a feedback control over the net growth of progenitors to reduce final eye size variability.</p>
