G.; McDevitt, T. C.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565933\nIn the nascent mesoderm, levels of Brachyury (TBXT) expression must be precisely regulated to ensure cells exit the primitive streak and pattern the anterior-posterior axis, but how this varying dosage informs morphogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we define the transcriptional consequences of TBXT dose reduction during early human gastrulation using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of gastrulation and mesoderm differentiation. Multiomic single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing of 2D gastruloids comprised of WT, TBXT heterozygous (TBXT-Het), or TBXT null (TBXT-KO) hiPSCs reveal that varying TBXT dosage does not compromise a cell's ability to differentiate into nascent mesoderm, but that the loss of TBXT significantly delays the temporal progression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This delay is dependent on TBXT dose, as cells heterozygous for TBXT proceed with EMT at an intermediate pace relative to WT or TBXT-KO. By differentiating iPSCs of the allelic series into nascent mesoderm in a monolayer format, we further illustrate that TBXT dose directly impacts the persistence of junctional proteins and cell-cell adhesions. These results demonstrate that EMT progression can be decoupled from the acquisition of mesodermal identity in the early gastrula and shed light on the mechanisms underlying human embryogenesis.\nMulti-Step Cellular Control of Molecular Condensation by Microtubules in Early Oogenesis\nAuthors: Deis, R.; Kar, S.; Ahmad, A.; Bogoch, Y.; Dominitz, A.; Shvaizer, G.; Sasson, E.; Mytlis, A.; Ben-Zvi, A.; Elkouby, Y. M.\nScore: 22.9, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.11.484019\nThe Balbiani body (Bb) is a membraneless organelle that forms in oocytes from insects to humans. In most vertebrates the Bb contains essential RNA-protein (RNP) granules, establishes oocyte polarity, and is required embryogenesis and reproduction. In mammals the Bb is associated with primordial follicle formation. However, despite its discovery in 1845, the mechanisms of Bb formation are still unknown in any species. Here, we discovered mechanisms of Bb formation in zebrafish. We first provide three lines of live-imaging, molecular, and biochemical evidence in developing ovaries in-vivo to conclude that the Bb forms a molecular condensate. We show that Bb RNPs form insoluble complexes dependently on Buc, an intrinsically disordered protein with a functional prion-like domain, which is essential for Bb formation. By using in vivo live-imaging, FRAP experiments and genetics, we reveal that Bb condensation requires the early liquid-liquid phase-transition of Buc, which later progresses to liquid-solid phase-separation. Further, we uncovered multi-step regulation by microtubules in controlling Bb condensation: first, by direct dynein-mediated trafficking of early condensing Buc granules, then by scaffolding condensed granules likely via molecular crowding, and finally by caging the mature Bb to prevent its over-growth and coarsening, likely by a Pickering effect. These regulatory steps ensure the formation of a single Bb condensate, which is essential for oocyte polarization and development. Our work resolves the origins of embryonic polarity, and identifies molecular condensation as an overlooked phenomena in the developing vertebrate ovary. While phase-separation is often viewed as a self-assembly process, our work proposes a new paradigm for the regulation of molecular condensation widely in biology.\nOOCYTE AND EMBRYO CULTURE UNDER OIL PROFOUNDLY ALTERS EFFECTIVE CONCENTRATIONS OF SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS\nAuthors: Remillard Labrosse, G.; Cohen, S.; Boucher, E.; Gagnon, K.; Vasilev, F.; Mihajlovic, A. I.; FitzHarris, G.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566607\nCulture of oocytes and embryos in media under oil is a cornerstone of fertility treatment, and extensively employed in experimental investigation of early mammalian development. It has been noted anecdotally by some that certain small molecule inhibitors might lose activity in oil-covered culture systems, presumably by drug partitioning into the oil. Here we took a pseudo-pharmacological approach to appraise this formally. Using different culture dish designs with defined media:oil volume ratios, we show that the EC50 of the widely employed microtubule poison nocodazole shifts as a function of the media:oil ratio, such that nocodazole concentrations that prevent cell division in oil-free culture fail to in oil-covered media drops. Relatively subtle changes in culture dish design lead to measurable changes in EC50. This effect is not specific to one type of culture oil, and can be readily observed both in oocyte and embryo culture experiments. We subsequently applied a similar approach to a small panel of widely employed cell cycle-related inhibitors, finding that most lose activity in standard oil-covered oocyte/embryo culture systems. Our data suggest that loss of small molecule activity in oil-covered oocyte and embryo culture is a widespread phenomenon with potentially far-reaching implications for data reproducibility, and we recommend avoiding oil-covered culture for experiments employing inhibitors/drugs wherever possible.\nVangl2 deficient zebrafish exhibit hallmarks of neural tube closure defects\nAuthors: MacGowan, J.; Cardenas, M.; Williams, M. K.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566412\nNeural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most devastating and common congenital anomalies worldwide, and the ability to model these conditions in vivo is essential for identifying causative genetic and environmental factors. Although zebrafish are ideal for rapid candidate testing, their neural tubes develop primarily via a solid neural keel rather that the fold-and-fuse method employed by mammals, raising questions about their suitability as an NTD model. Here, we demonstrate that despite outward differences, zebrafish anterior neurulation closely resembles that of mammals. For the first time, we directly observe fusion of the bilateral neural folds to enclose a lumen in zebrafish embryos. The neural folds fuse by zippering between multiple distinct but contiguous closure sites. Embryos lacking vangl2, a core planar cell polarity and NTD risk gene, exhibit delayed neural fold fusion and abnormal neural groove formation, yielding distinct openings and midline bifurcations in the developing neural tube. These data provide direct evidence for fold-and-fuse neurulation in zebrafish and its disruption upon loss of an NTD risk gene, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the utility of zebrafish for modeling NTDs.\nTranscriptome analysis of the mouse fetal and adult rete ovarii and surrounding tissues\nAuthors: Anbarci, D. N.; ORourke, R.; Xiang, Y.; Peters, D. T.; Capel, B.; McKey, J.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565717\nThe rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during fetal development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood in mice. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it has been absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three distinct regions: the intraovarian rete (IOR) within the ovary, the extraovarian rete (EOR) in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete (CR) linking the EOR and IOR. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in maintaining ovarian homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. To uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptome analysis, encompassing bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level sequencing of both fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre- H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP. This study presents three datasets, which highlight RO-specific gene expression signatures and reveal differences in gene expression across the three RO regions during development and in adulthood. The integration and rigorous validation of these datasets will advance our understanding of the ROs roles in ovarian development, female maturation, and adult female fertility. Short narrativeThis study employs comprehensive bulk, single cell and single nucleus transcriptome analysis to uncover gene expression signatures of the fetal and adult rete ovarii (RO).\nHuman organoid modeling of congenital malformations caused by RFX6 mutations reveal an essential role for this transcription factor in establishing and maintaining duodenal identity upstream of PDX1\nAuthors: Wells, J. M.; Sanchez, G.; Rankin, S. A.; Paul, E.; McCauley, H. A.; Kechele, D.; Enriquez, J.; Jones, N.-H.; Greeley, S. A.; Letourneau-Friedberg, L.; Zorn, A. A.; Krishnamurthy, M.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566480\nThe gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of highly specialized organs from the proximal esophagus to the distal colon, each with unique functions. Rare congenital malformations of the GI tract, including organ atresia, agenesis or mis-patterning are linked to gene mutations although the molecular basis of these malformations has been poorly studied due to lack of model systems to study human development. We identified a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 with pancreatic agenesis as previously described. In addition, the patient had duodenal mal-rotation and atresia suggesting that establishment of the proximal small intestine was impaired in these patients. To identify the molecular basis of the intestinal malformation we generated induced pluripotent stem cell lines from this patient, and derived human intestinal organoid (HIOs) to identify how mutations in RFX6 impact intestinal patterning and function. We identified that the duodenal identity of HIOs and patient tissues had adopted a more distal small intestinal signature, including expression of SATB2, normally expressed in the ileum and colon. CRISPR-mediated correction of RFX6 restored duodenal identity, including expression of PDX1, which is required for duodenal development. Using transcriptomic approaches in HIOs and Xenopus embryos we identified that PDX1 is a downstream transcriptional target of RFX6 and that PDX1 expression in a RFX6 mutant background was sufficient to rescue duodenal identity. However, RFX6 had a PDX1-independent role in regulating expression of components of WNT, HH, and BMP signaling pathways that are critical for establishing early regional identity in the GI tract. In summary, we have identified that RFX6 is one of the most upstream regulators early intestinal patterning in vertebrates and that it acts by regulating key transcriptional and signaling pathways.\nGeneration and characterization of Sema6aΔcyt conditional knockout mice\nAuthors: Verhagen, M. G.; van Battum, E. Y.; van den Munkhof, M. H.; Lemstra, S.; Rehberg, K.; van der Meer, C.; van Kronenburg, N. C. H.; Adolfs, Y.; Pasterkamp, R. J.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565851\nThe axon guidance molecule Semaphorin-6A (SEMA6A) plays a key role during nervous system development. SEMA6A, classically known as a ligand for Plexin-A2 and -A4, is a transmembrane protein that can also elicit signaling via its intracellular domain in vitro. However, the physiological relevance of this reverse signaling route is largely unknown. We generated a new transgenic mouse model, Sema6a{Delta}cytfl/fl, in which the cytosolic part of SEMA6A can be conditionally removed using Cre-recombination. Upon Sema6a{Delta}cyt mutation, SEMA6A can only act as a ligand and reverse signaling is perturbed. Germline deletion of SEMA6As intracellular part results in developmental defects in axon pathfinding and neuron migration that partially phenocopy defects observed in full Sema6a knockout mice. These defects include disorganization of the anterior commissure, piriform cortex, lateral olfactory tract, thalamocortical and corticospinal white matter tracts, and defected neuron migration in the neocortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, the hippocampal malformation described in Sema6a full knockout mice was not reproduced, suggesting a specific role for SEMA6A forward signaling in hippocampal development. Our results indicate that the intracellular domain of SEMA6A is essential for proper axon targeting and neuron migration, and provide the first proof of a SEMA6A reverse signaling pathway in vivo.\nAlk1/Endoglin dependent increases in vein endothelial cell sizes precipitate arteriovenous malformations\nAuthors: Siekmann, A. F.; Diwan, Z.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566079\nAberrations in blood vessel diameters can disrupt the hierarchical patterning of the vasculature and cause congenital vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Despite the identification of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway as a major driver in AVM pathology, we still lack an understanding of the early embryonic events regulating vessel hierarchy and arteriovenous shunt formation in vivo. We therefore studied blood vessel diameter control of the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV) in zebrafish embryos. Our findings reveal that increases in blood flow during embryonic development result in increases in arterial endothelial cell (EC) sizes, ultimately enlarging DA diameters. By contrast, anterior regions of the PCV did not respond to changes in blood flow, while caudal regions, close to the artery-vein junction, responded to changes in flow like the DA, but to a lesser extent. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the reduced response of PCV ECs to flow, we studied zebrafish embryos mutant for the BMP pathway components endoglin and alk1. Through the generation of genetic mosaics, we discovered that both Endoglin and Alk1 were required cell autonomously in PCV cells to restrict EC sizes and thereby limit venous diameter increases in response to flow. We further revealed that initial increases in the diameter of the caudal PCV secondarily led to increased DA diameters and cell sizes. Therefore, Alk1/Endoglin signaling prevents vein ECs from behaving like arterial ECs. This differential response of arterial and venous EC cells to increases in flow is necessary to prevent the development of AVMs. This study thus offers insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of vessel hierarchy during early development and identifies changes in EC shapes as an important contributor in determining blood vessel diameters. Failure in this mechanism underlies the vein-specific initiation of AVMs in vertebrate models of HHT.\nCFL1-dependent dynamicity of surface ectoderm filopodia-like protrusions increases neurulation zippering speed in mice\nAuthors: Marshall, A.; Krstevski, A.; Crosswell, H.; Shah, R.; Maniou, E.; Greene, N.; Copp, A.; Galea, G. L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-11-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.565942\nProgression of caudally-directed embryonic neural tube closure must exceed that of body axis elongation, otherwise closure is incomplete and neural tube defects arise. Genetic deletion and pharmacological antagonism studies establish the critical role of actomyosin regulation in this closure process in mice, but many models of impaired F-actin regulation are limited by early embryonic lethality, which precludes mechanistic insight in vivo. Here, we test the physiological functions of the F-actin severing protein CFL1 by selective deletion in various tissues of mouse embryos undergoing neural tube closure. Loss of CFL1 in the cranial neuroepithelium diminishes selective apical localisation of F-actin and produces dysmorphic, asymmetrical headfolds which fail to meet at the dorsal midline, causing exencephaly, with partial penetrance. During spinal neurulation, neuroepithelial CFL1 is dispensable, but its expression in the surface ectoderm enhances the dynamicity of filopodia-like protrusions involved in the zippering process of midline epithelial fusion. Compared with littermate controls, spinal zippering speed is decreased by 30% in embryos lacking surface ectoderm CFL1 and approximately 30% of embryos develop spina bifida. These findings suggest that molecular-level cytoskeletal regulation by CFL1 sets the cellular-level dynamicity of filopodial extensions which limit tissue- level zippering speed necessary to fully close the neural tube.\nNetrin1 patterns the dorsal spinal cord through modulation of Bmp signaling\nAuthors: Alvarez, S.; Gupta, S.; Honeychurch, K.; Mercado-Ayon, Y.; Kawaguchi, R.; Butler, S. J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.02.565384\nWe have identified an unexpected role for netrin1 as a suppressor of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling in the developing dorsal spinal cord. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches in chicken, embryonic stem cell (ESC), and mouse models, we have observed that manipulating the level of netrin1 specifically alters the patterning of the Bmp-dependent dorsal interneurons (dIs), dI1-dI3. Altered netrin1 levels also change Bmp signaling activity, as measured by bioinformatics, and monitoring phosophoSmad1/5/8 activation, the canonical intermediate of Bmp signaling, and Id levels, a known Bmp target. Together, these studies support the hypothesis that netrin1 acts from the intermediate spinal cord to regionally confine Bmp signaling to the dorsal spinal cord. Thus, netrin1 has reiterative activities shaping dorsal spinal circuits, first by regulating cell fate decisions and then acting as a guidance cue to direct axon extension.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In the nascent mesoderm, levels of Brachyury (TBXT) expression must be precisely regulated to ensure cells exit the primitive streak and pattern the anterior-posterior axis, but how this varying dosage informs morphogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we define the transcriptional consequences of TBXT dose reduction during early human gastrulation using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of gastrulation and mesoderm differentiation. Multiomic single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing of 2D gastruloids comprised of WT, TBXT heterozygous (TBXT-Het), or TBXT null (TBXT-KO) hiPSCs reveal that varying TBXT dosage does not compromise a cell&#39;s ability to differentiate into nascent mesoderm, but that the loss of TBXT significantly delays the temporal progression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This delay is dependent on TBXT dose, as cells heterozygous for TBXT proceed with EMT at an intermediate pace relative to WT or TBXT-KO. By differentiating iPSCs of the allelic series into nascent mesoderm in a monolayer format, we further illustrate that TBXT dose directly impacts the persistence of junctional proteins and cell-cell adhesions. These results demonstrate that EMT progression can be decoupled from the acquisition of mesodermal identity in the early gastrula and shed light on the mechanisms underlying human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Balbiani body (Bb) is a membraneless organelle that forms in oocytes from insects to humans. In most vertebrates the Bb contains essential RNA-protein (RNP) granules, establishes oocyte polarity, and is required embryogenesis and reproduction. In mammals the Bb is associated with primordial follicle formation. However, despite its discovery in 1845, the mechanisms of Bb formation are still unknown in any species. Here, we discovered mechanisms of Bb formation in zebrafish. We first provide three lines of live-imaging, molecular, and biochemical evidence in developing ovaries in-vivo to conclude that the Bb forms a molecular condensate. We show that Bb RNPs form insoluble complexes dependently on Buc, an intrinsically disordered protein with a functional prion-like domain, which is essential for Bb formation. By using in vivo live-imaging, FRAP experiments and genetics, we reveal that Bb condensation requires the early liquid-liquid phase-transition of Buc, which later progresses to liquid-solid phase-separation. Further, we uncovered multi-step regulation by microtubules in controlling Bb condensation: first, by direct dynein-mediated trafficking of early condensing Buc granules, then by scaffolding condensed granules likely via molecular crowding, and finally by caging the mature Bb to prevent its over-growth and coarsening, likely by a Pickering effect. These regulatory steps ensure the formation of a single Bb condensate, which is essential for oocyte polarization and development. Our work resolves the origins of embryonic polarity, and identifies molecular condensation as an overlooked phenomena in the developing vertebrate ovary. While phase-separation is often viewed as a self-assembly process, our work proposes a new paradigm for the regulation of molecular condensation widely in biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Culture of oocytes and embryos in media under oil is a cornerstone of fertility treatment, and extensively employed in experimental investigation of early mammalian development. It has been noted anecdotally by some that certain small molecule inhibitors might lose activity in oil-covered culture systems, presumably by drug partitioning into the oil. Here we took a pseudo-pharmacological approach to appraise this formally. Using different culture dish designs with defined media:oil volume ratios, we show that the EC50 of the widely employed microtubule poison nocodazole shifts as a function of the media:oil ratio, such that nocodazole concentrations that prevent cell division in oil-free culture fail to in oil-covered media drops. Relatively subtle changes in culture dish design lead to measurable changes in EC50. This effect is not specific to one type of culture oil, and can be readily observed both in oocyte and embryo culture experiments. We subsequently applied a similar approach to a small panel of widely employed cell cycle-related inhibitors, finding that most lose activity in standard oil-covered oocyte/embryo culture systems. Our data suggest that loss of small molecule activity in oil-covered oocyte and embryo culture is a widespread phenomenon with potentially far-reaching implications for data reproducibility, and we recommend avoiding oil-covered culture for experiments employing inhibitors/drugs wherever possible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most devastating and common congenital anomalies worldwide, and the ability to model these conditions in vivo is essential for identifying causative genetic and environmental factors. Although zebrafish are ideal for rapid candidate testing, their neural tubes develop primarily via a solid neural keel rather that the fold-and-fuse method employed by mammals, raising questions about their suitability as an NTD model. Here, we demonstrate that despite outward differences, zebrafish anterior neurulation closely resembles that of mammals. For the first time, we directly observe fusion of the bilateral neural folds to enclose a lumen in zebrafish embryos. The neural folds fuse by zippering between multiple distinct but contiguous closure sites. Embryos lacking vangl2, a core planar cell polarity and NTD risk gene, exhibit delayed neural fold fusion and abnormal neural groove formation, yielding distinct openings and midline bifurcations in the developing neural tube. These data provide direct evidence for fold-and-fuse neurulation in zebrafish and its disruption upon loss of an NTD risk gene, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the utility of zebrafish for modeling NTDs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during fetal development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood in mice. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it has been absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three distinct regions: the intraovarian rete (IOR) within the ovary, the extraovarian rete (EOR) in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete (CR) linking the EOR and IOR. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in maintaining ovarian homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. To uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptome analysis, encompassing bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level sequencing of both fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre- H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP. This study presents three datasets, which highlight RO-specific gene expression signatures and reveal differences in gene expression across the three RO regions during development and in adulthood. The integration and rigorous validation of these datasets will advance our understanding of the ROs roles in ovarian development, female maturation, and adult female fertility.

Short narrativeThis study employs comprehensive bulk, single cell and single nucleus transcriptome analysis to uncover gene expression signatures of the fetal and adult rete ovarii (RO).</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of highly specialized organs from the proximal esophagus to the distal colon, each with unique functions. Rare congenital malformations of the GI tract, including organ atresia, agenesis or mis-patterning are linked to gene mutations although the molecular basis of these malformations has been poorly studied due to lack of model systems to study human development. We identified a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 with pancreatic agenesis as previously described. In addition, the patient had duodenal mal-rotation and atresia suggesting that establishment of the proximal small intestine was impaired in these patients. To identify the molecular basis of the intestinal malformation we generated induced pluripotent stem cell lines from this patient, and derived human intestinal organoid (HIOs) to identify how mutations in RFX6 impact intestinal patterning and function. We identified that the duodenal identity of HIOs and patient tissues had adopted a more distal small intestinal signature, including expression of SATB2, normally expressed in the ileum and colon. CRISPR-mediated correction of RFX6 restored duodenal identity, including expression of PDX1, which is required for duodenal development. Using transcriptomic approaches in HIOs and Xenopus embryos we identified that PDX1 is a downstream transcriptional target of RFX6 and that PDX1 expression in a RFX6 mutant background was sufficient to rescue duodenal identity. However, RFX6 had a PDX1-independent role in regulating expression of components of WNT, HH, and BMP signaling pathways that are critical for establishing early regional identity in the GI tract. In summary, we have identified that RFX6 is one of the most upstream regulators early intestinal patterning in vertebrates and that it acts by regulating key transcriptional and signaling pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The axon guidance molecule Semaphorin-6A (SEMA6A) plays a key role during nervous system development. SEMA6A, classically known as a ligand for Plexin-A2 and -A4, is a transmembrane protein that can also elicit signaling via its intracellular domain in vitro. However, the physiological relevance of this  reverse signaling route is largely unknown. We generated a new transgenic mouse model, Sema6a{Delta}cytfl/fl, in which the cytosolic part of SEMA6A can be conditionally removed using Cre-recombination. Upon Sema6a{Delta}cyt mutation, SEMA6A can only act as a ligand and reverse signaling is perturbed. Germline deletion of SEMA6As intracellular part results in developmental defects in axon pathfinding and neuron migration that partially phenocopy defects observed in full Sema6a knockout mice. These defects include disorganization of the anterior commissure, piriform cortex, lateral olfactory tract, thalamocortical and corticospinal white matter tracts, and defected neuron migration in the neocortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, the hippocampal malformation described in Sema6a full knockout mice was not reproduced, suggesting a specific role for SEMA6A forward signaling in hippocampal development. Our results indicate that the intracellular domain of SEMA6A is essential for proper axon targeting and neuron migration, and provide the first proof of a SEMA6A reverse signaling pathway in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrations in blood vessel diameters can disrupt the hierarchical patterning of the vasculature and cause congenital vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Despite the identification of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway as a major driver in AVM pathology, we still lack an understanding of the early embryonic events regulating vessel hierarchy and arteriovenous shunt formation in vivo. We therefore studied blood vessel diameter control of the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV) in zebrafish embryos. Our findings reveal that increases in blood flow during embryonic development result in increases in arterial endothelial cell (EC) sizes, ultimately enlarging DA diameters. By contrast, anterior regions of the PCV did not respond to changes in blood flow, while caudal regions, close to the artery-vein junction, responded to changes in flow like the DA, but to a lesser extent. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the reduced response of PCV ECs to flow, we studied zebrafish embryos mutant for the BMP pathway components endoglin and alk1. Through the generation of genetic mosaics, we discovered that both Endoglin and Alk1 were required cell autonomously in PCV cells to restrict EC sizes and thereby limit venous diameter increases in response to flow. We further revealed that initial increases in the diameter of the caudal PCV secondarily led to increased DA diameters and cell sizes. Therefore, Alk1/Endoglin signaling prevents vein ECs from behaving like arterial ECs. This differential response of arterial and venous EC cells to increases in flow is necessary to prevent the development of AVMs. This study thus offers insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of vessel hierarchy during early development and identifies changes in EC shapes as an important contributor in determining blood vessel diameters. Failure in this mechanism underlies the vein-specific initiation of AVMs in vertebrate models of HHT.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Progression of caudally-directed embryonic neural tube closure must exceed that of body axis elongation, otherwise closure is incomplete and neural tube defects arise. Genetic deletion and pharmacological antagonism studies establish the critical role of actomyosin regulation in this closure process in mice, but many models of impaired F-actin regulation are limited by early embryonic lethality, which precludes mechanistic insight in vivo. Here, we test the physiological functions of the F-actin severing protein CFL1 by selective deletion in various tissues of mouse embryos undergoing neural tube closure. Loss of CFL1 in the cranial neuroepithelium diminishes selective apical localisation of F-actin and produces dysmorphic, asymmetrical headfolds which fail to meet at the dorsal midline, causing exencephaly, with partial penetrance. During spinal neurulation, neuroepithelial CFL1 is dispensable, but its expression in the surface ectoderm enhances the dynamicity of filopodia-like protrusions involved in the zippering process of midline epithelial fusion. Compared with littermate controls, spinal zippering speed is decreased by 30% in embryos lacking surface ectoderm CFL1 and approximately 30% of embryos develop spina bifida. These findings suggest that molecular-level cytoskeletal regulation by CFL1 sets the cellular-level dynamicity of filopodial extensions which limit tissue- level zippering speed necessary to fully close the neural tube.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We have identified an unexpected role for netrin1 as a suppressor of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling in the developing dorsal spinal cord. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches in chicken, embryonic stem cell (ESC), and mouse models, we have observed that manipulating the level of netrin1 specifically alters the patterning of the Bmp-dependent dorsal interneurons (dIs), dI1-dI3. Altered netrin1 levels also change Bmp signaling activity, as measured by bioinformatics, and monitoring phosophoSmad1/5/8 activation, the canonical intermediate of Bmp signaling, and Id levels, a known Bmp target. Together, these studies support the hypothesis that netrin1 acts from the intermediate spinal cord to regionally confine Bmp signaling to the dorsal spinal cord. Thus, netrin1 has reiterative activities shaping dorsal spinal circuits, first by regulating cell fate decisions and then acting as a guidance cue to direct axon extension.</p>
