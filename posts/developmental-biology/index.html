J.; McClain, M.; Weaver, K.; Delventhal, K.; Morrison, J. A.; McKinney, M. C.; McKinney, S. A.; Sanchez Alvarado, A.\nScore: 42.9, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577494\nCamera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.\nPerturbing nuclear glycosylation in the mouse preimplantation embryo slows down embryonic growth\nAuthors: Formichetti, S.; Chitnavis, U.; Sadowska, A.; Liu, N.; Boskovic, A.; Boulard, M.\nScore: 20.5, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576677\nThe only known form of intracellular protein glycosylation (O-GlcNAc) is reversible and has been mapped on thousands of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, including RNA polymerase II, transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. The O-GlcNAc modification is catalyzed by a single enzyme known as O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), that is required for mammalian early development. Remarkably, the regulatory function of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the embryo as well as the embryonic O-GlcNAc proteome remain unknown. Here, we devised a new method to enzymatically remove O-GlcNAc from preimplantation embryonic nuclei, where it accumulates coincidently with embryonic genome activation (EGA). Unexpectedly, the depletion of nuclear O-GlcNAc to undetectable levels has no impact on EGA, but dampens the transcriptional activation of the translational machinery, and triggers a spindle checkpoint response. These molecular alterations were phenotypically associated with a developmental delay starting from early cleavage stages and persisting after embryo implantation, establishing a novel link between nuclear glycosylation and embryonic growth.\nWnt signaling alters CTCF binding patterns and global chromatin structure\nAuthors: Nordin, A.; Chakraborty, C.; Jonasson, M.; Dano, O.; Zambanini, G.; Pagella, P.; Remeseiro, S.; Cantu, C.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576696\nWnt signaling plays a pivotal role during development, stem cell maintenance, and tissue homeostasis. Upon Wnt pathway activation, {beta}-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds the TCF/LEF transcription factors to drive the context-specific expression of Wnt target genes. Coordinating gene expression programs in vertebrates requires a complex interplay between the regulatory and the 3D organization of the genome. However, the impact of Wnt signaling on genome structure has been poorly explored. Here we investigated how Wnt signaling activation influences the binding patterns of CTCF, one of the core architectural proteins that helps establish the 3D genome organization be demarcating topologically associated domains (TAD). This study uncovered a series of CTCF rearrangements under Wnt, that we termed RUW. Notably, RUW sites that were gained upon Wnt activation were typically dependent on {beta}-catenin and were characterized by both CTCF and TCF/LEF binding. Accordingly, many CTCF RUWs aligned with {beta}-catenin binding patterns, and {beta}-catenin and CTCF co-localized in vivo in discreet nuclear puncta only upon pathway activation. Genome-wide investigation of CTCF-mediated 3D genomic interactions upon Wnt pathway stimulation supported the role of the identified RUWs in mediating Wnt-dependent chromatin loops. Lastly, targeted disruption of selected CTCF binding sites demonstrated their functional contribution to Wnt target gene regulation, implicating regulation of the 3D genomic structure in the execution of transcriptional programs orchestrated by developmental pathways.\nGlycolysis-Wnt signaling axis tunes developmental timing of embryo segmentation\nAuthors: Miyazawa, H.; Rada, J.; Sanchez, P. G. L.; Esposito, E.; Bunina, D.; Girardot, C.; Zaugg, J.; Aulehla, A.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-23 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576629\nThe question of how metabolism impacts development is seeing a renaissance [1, 2]. How metabolism exerts instructive signaling functions is one of the central issues that need to be resolved. We tackled this question in the context of mouse embryonic axis segmentation. Previous studies have shown that changes in central carbon metabolism impact Wnt signaling [3-6] and the period of the segmentation clock [7], which controls the timing of axis segmentation. Here, we reveal that glycolysis tunes the segmentation clock period in an anti-correlated manner: higher glycolytic flux slows down the clock, and vice versa. Transcriptome and gene regulatory network analyses identified Wnt signaling and specifically the transcription factor Tcf7l2, previously associated with increased risk for diabetes [8, 9], as potential mechanisms underlying flux-dependent control of the clock period. Critically, we show that deletion of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 rescued the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by increased glycolysis, demonstrating that glycolysis instructs Wnt signaling to control the clock period. In addition, we demonstrate metabolic entrainment of the segmentation clock: periodic changes in the levels of glucose or glycolytic sentinel metabolite fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) synchronize signaling oscillations. Notably, periodic FBP pulses first entrained Wnt signaling oscillations and subsequently Notch signaling oscillations. We hence conclude that metabolic entrainment has an immediate, specific effect on Wnt signaling. Combined, our work identifies a glycolysis-FBP-Wnt signaling axis that tunes developmental timing, highlighting the instructive signaling role of metabolism in embryonic development.\nCell cycle length regulates heterochromatin reprogramming during early development in non-mammalian vertebrates\nAuthors: Fukushima, H. S.; Ikeda, T.; Ikeda, S.; Takeda, H.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.576847\nHeterochromatin marks such as H3K9me3 undergoes global erasure and re-establishment after fertilization, and the proper reprogramming of H3K9me3 is essential for early development. Despite the widely conserved dynamics of heterochromatin reprogramming in invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates, previous studies have shown that the underlying mechanisms may differ between species. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of H3K9me3 dynamics in medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) as a non-mammalian vertebrate model, and found that rapid cell cycle during the cleavage stages causes DNA replication-dependent passive erasure of H3K9me3. We also found that cell cycle slowing, toward the mid-blastula transition, permits increasing nuclear accumulation of H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase Setdb1, leading to the onset of H3K9me3 re-accumulation. We further demonstrated that cell cycle length in early development regulates H3K9me3 reprogramming in zebrafish and Xenopus laevis as well. Together with the previous studies in invertebrates, we propose that the cell cycle length-dependent mechanism for both global erasure and re-accumulation of H3K9me3 is widely conserved among rapid-cleavage species of non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates such as Drosophila, C. elegans and teleost fish.\nCDX2 dose-dependently influences the gene regulatory network underlying human extraembryonic mesoderm development\nAuthors: Bulger, E. A.; McDevitt, T. C.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.25.577277\nProper regulation of gene dosage is critical for the development of the early embryo and the extraembryonic tissues that support it. Specifically, loss of Cdx2 in vivo leads to stunted development of the allantois, an extraembryonic mesoderm-derived structure critical for nutrient delivery and waste removal in the early embryo. In this study, we investigate how CDX2 dose-dependently influences the gene regulatory network underlying extraembryonic mesoderm development. We generate an allelic series for CDX2 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) consisting of WT, heterozygous, and homozygous null CDX2 genotypes, differentiate these cells in a 2D gastruloid model, and subject these cells to multiomic single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. We identify several genes that CDX2 dose-dependently regulate cytoskeletal integrity and adhesiveness in the extraembryonic mesoderm population, including regulators of the VEGF, canonical WNT, and non-canonical WNT signaling pathways. Despite these dose-dependent gene expression patterns, snATAC-seq reveals that heterozygous CDX2 expression is capable of inducing a WT-like chromatin accessibility profile, suggesting accessibility is not sufficient to drive gene expression when the CDX2 dosage is reduced. Finally, because the loss of CDX2 or TBXT phenocopy one another in vivo, we compare differentially expressed genes in our CDX2 knock-out model to those from TBXT knock-out hiPSCs differentiated in an analogous experiment. This comparison identifies several communally misregulated genes that are critical for cytoskeletal integrity and tissue permeability, including ANK3 and ANGPT1. Together, these results clarify how CDX2 dose-dependently regulates gene expression in the extraembryonic mesoderm and suggest these genes may underlie the defects in vascular development and allantoic elongation seen in the absence or reduction of CDX2 in vivo.\nAn optimized live imaging and growth analysis approach for Arabidopsis Sepals\nAuthors: Yadav, A. S.; Roeder, A.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576735\nBackground Arabidopsis thaliana sepals are excellent models for analyzing growth of entire organs due to their relatively small size, which can be captured at a cellular resolution under a confocal microscope [1]. To investigate how growth of different tissue layers generates unique organ morphologies, it is necessary to live-image deep into the tissue. However, imaging deep cell layers of the sepal is practically challenging, as it is hindered by the presence of extracellular air spaces between mesophyll cells, among other factors which causes optical aberrations. Image processing is also difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the deeper tissue layers, an issue mainly associated with live imaging datasets. Addressing some of these challenges, we provide an optimized methodology for live imaging sepals and subsequent image processing. This helps us track the growth of individual cells on the outer and inner epidermal layers, which are the key drivers of sepal morphogenesis. Results For live imaging sepals across all tissue layers at early stages of development, we found that the use of a bright fluorescent membrane marker, coupled with increased laser intensity and an enhanced Z- resolution produces high-quality images suitable for downstream image processing. Our optimized parameters allowed us to image the bottommost cell layer of the sepal (inner epidermal layer) without compromising viability. We used a voxel removal technique to visualize the inner epidermal layer in MorphoGraphX [2, 3] image processing software. Finally, we describe the process of optimizing the parameters for creating a 2.5D mesh surface for the inner epidermis. This allowed segmentation and parent tracking of individual cells through multiple time points, despite the weak signal of the inner epidermal cells. Conclusion We provide a robust pipeline for imaging and analyzing growth across inner and outer epidermal layers during early sepal development. Our approach can potentially be employed for analyzing growth of other internal cell layers of the sepals as well. For each of the steps, approaches, and parameters we used, we have provided in-depth explanations to help researchers understand the rationale and replicate our pipeline.\nEnvironmental and molecular control of tissue-specific ionocyte differentiation in zebrafish\nAuthors: Peloggia, J.; Lush, M. E.; Tsai, Y.-Y.; Wood, C.; Piotrowski, T.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575421\nOrganisms adjust their physiology to cope with environmental fluctuations and maintain fitness. These adaptations occur via genetic changes over multiple generations or through acclimation, a set of reversible phenotypic changes that confer resilience to the individual. Aquatic organisms are subject to dramatic seasonal fluctuations in water salinity, which can affect the function of lateral line mechanosensory hair cells. To maintain hair cell function when salinity decreases, ion-regulating cells, Neuromast-associated ionocytes (Nm ionocytes), increase in number and invade lateral line neuromasts. How environmental changes trigger this adaptive differentiation of Nm ionocytes and how these cells are specified is still unknown. Here, we identify Nm ionocyte progenitors as foxi3a/foxi3b-expressing skin cells and show that their differentiation is associated with sequential activation of different Notch pathway components, which control ionocyte survival. We demonstrate that new Nm ionocytes are rapidly specified by absolute salinity levels, independently of stress response pathways. We further show that Nm ionocyte differentiation is selectively triggered by depletion of specific ions, such as Ca2+ and Na+/Cl-, but not by low K+ levels, and is independent of media osmolarity. Finally, we demonstrate that hair cell activity plays a role in Nm ionocyte recruitment and that systemic factors are not necessary for Nm ionocyte induction. In summary, we have identified how environmental changes activate a signaling cascade that triggers basal skin cell progenitors to differentiate into Nm ionocytes and invade lateral line organs. This adaptive behavior is an example of physiological plasticity that may prove essential for survival in changing climates.\nExploring functional connectivity in clinical and data-driven groups of preterm and term adults\nAuthors: Hadaya, L.; Vasa, F.; Dimitrakopoulou, K.; Saqi, M.; Shergill, S. S.; Edwards, D.; Batalle, D.; Leech, R.; Nosarti, C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576651\nBackgroundAdults born very preterm (i.e., at \u003c33 weeks gestation) are more susceptible to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional difficulties, compared to full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm vs full-term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth status). MethodsThe Network Based Statistic approach was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity differentiating between i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57% female, respectively), and ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using consensus clustering (n= 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status, and in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. Post-hoc two-way group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes. ResultsVery preterm compared to full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in subsections of the default mode, visual, and ventral attention networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles (irrespective of birth status), identified two data-driven subgroups: An \"At-risk\" subgroup, characterised by increased cognitive, mental health, and socio-emotional difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular regions, relative to a \"Resilient\" subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity. ConclusionsFunctional connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups. We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localised functional connectivity alterations seen in the \"At-risk\" subgroup relative to the \"Resilient\" subgroup may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of birth status.\nExploring functional connectivity in clinical and data-driven groups of preterm and term adults\nAuthors: Hadaya, L.; Vasa, F.; Dimitrakopoulou, K.; Saqi, M.; Shergill, S.

        <p class="abstract">Camera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The only known form of intracellular protein glycosylation (O-GlcNAc) is reversible and has been mapped on thousands of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, including RNA polymerase II, transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. The O-GlcNAc modification is catalyzed by a single enzyme known as O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), that is required for mammalian early development. Remarkably, the regulatory function of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the embryo as well as the embryonic O-GlcNAc proteome remain unknown. Here, we devised a new method to enzymatically remove O-GlcNAc from preimplantation embryonic nuclei, where it accumulates coincidently with embryonic genome activation (EGA). Unexpectedly, the depletion of nuclear O-GlcNAc to undetectable levels has no impact on EGA, but dampens the transcriptional activation of the translational machinery, and triggers a spindle checkpoint response. These molecular alterations were phenotypically associated with a developmental delay starting from early cleavage stages and persisting after embryo implantation, establishing a novel link between nuclear glycosylation and embryonic growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role during development, stem cell maintenance, and tissue homeostasis. Upon Wnt pathway activation, {beta}-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds the TCF/LEF transcription factors to drive the context-specific expression of Wnt target genes. Coordinating gene expression programs in vertebrates requires a complex interplay between the regulatory and the 3D organization of the genome. However, the impact of Wnt signaling on genome structure has been poorly explored. Here we investigated how Wnt signaling activation influences the binding patterns of CTCF, one of the core architectural proteins that helps establish the 3D genome organization be demarcating topologically associated domains (TAD). This study uncovered a series of CTCF rearrangements under Wnt, that we termed RUW. Notably, RUW sites that were gained upon Wnt activation were typically dependent on {beta}-catenin and were characterized by both CTCF and TCF/LEF binding. Accordingly, many CTCF RUWs aligned with {beta}-catenin binding patterns, and {beta}-catenin and CTCF co-localized in vivo in discreet nuclear puncta only upon pathway activation. Genome-wide investigation of CTCF-mediated 3D genomic interactions upon Wnt pathway stimulation supported the role of the identified RUWs in mediating Wnt-dependent chromatin loops. Lastly, targeted disruption of selected CTCF binding sites demonstrated their functional contribution to Wnt target gene regulation, implicating regulation of the 3D genomic structure in the execution of transcriptional programs orchestrated by developmental pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The question of how metabolism impacts development is seeing a renaissance [1, 2]. How metabolism exerts instructive signaling functions is one of the central issues that need to be resolved. We tackled this question in the context of mouse embryonic axis segmentation. Previous studies have shown that changes in central carbon metabolism impact Wnt signaling [3-6] and the period of the segmentation clock [7], which controls the timing of axis segmentation. Here, we reveal that glycolysis tunes the segmentation clock period in an anti-correlated manner: higher glycolytic flux slows down the clock, and vice versa. Transcriptome and gene regulatory network analyses identified Wnt signaling and specifically the transcription factor Tcf7l2, previously associated with increased risk for diabetes [8, 9], as potential mechanisms underlying flux-dependent control of the clock period. Critically, we show that deletion of the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 rescued the slow segmentation clock phenotype caused by increased glycolysis, demonstrating that glycolysis instructs Wnt signaling to control the clock period. In addition, we demonstrate metabolic entrainment of the segmentation clock: periodic changes in the levels of glucose or glycolytic sentinel metabolite fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) synchronize signaling oscillations. Notably, periodic FBP pulses first entrained Wnt signaling oscillations and subsequently Notch signaling oscillations. We hence conclude that metabolic entrainment has an immediate, specific effect on Wnt signaling. Combined, our work identifies a glycolysis-FBP-Wnt signaling axis that tunes developmental timing, highlighting the instructive signaling role of metabolism in embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heterochromatin marks such as H3K9me3 undergoes global erasure and re-establishment after fertilization, and the proper reprogramming of H3K9me3 is essential for early development. Despite the widely conserved dynamics of heterochromatin reprogramming in invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrates, previous studies have shown that the underlying mechanisms may differ between species. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of H3K9me3 dynamics in medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) as a non-mammalian vertebrate model, and found that rapid cell cycle during the cleavage stages causes DNA replication-dependent passive erasure of H3K9me3. We also found that cell cycle slowing, toward the mid-blastula transition, permits increasing nuclear accumulation of H3K9me3 histone methyltransferase Setdb1, leading to the onset of H3K9me3 re-accumulation. We further demonstrated that cell cycle length in early development regulates H3K9me3 reprogramming in zebrafish and Xenopus laevis as well. Together with the previous studies in invertebrates, we propose that the cell cycle length-dependent mechanism for both global erasure and re-accumulation of H3K9me3 is widely conserved among rapid-cleavage species of non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates such as Drosophila, C. elegans and teleost fish.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Proper regulation of gene dosage is critical for the development of the early embryo and the extraembryonic tissues that support it. Specifically, loss of Cdx2 in vivo leads to stunted development of the allantois, an extraembryonic mesoderm-derived structure critical for nutrient delivery and waste removal in the early embryo. In this study, we investigate how CDX2 dose-dependently influences the gene regulatory network underlying extraembryonic mesoderm development. We generate an allelic series for CDX2 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) consisting of WT, heterozygous, and homozygous null CDX2 genotypes, differentiate these cells in a 2D gastruloid model, and subject these cells to multiomic single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. We identify several genes that CDX2 dose-dependently regulate cytoskeletal integrity and adhesiveness in the extraembryonic mesoderm population, including regulators of the VEGF, canonical WNT, and non-canonical WNT signaling pathways. Despite these dose-dependent gene expression patterns, snATAC-seq reveals that heterozygous CDX2 expression is capable of inducing a WT-like chromatin accessibility profile, suggesting accessibility is not sufficient to drive gene expression when the CDX2 dosage is reduced. Finally, because the loss of CDX2 or TBXT phenocopy one another in vivo, we compare differentially expressed genes in our CDX2 knock-out model to those from TBXT knock-out hiPSCs differentiated in an analogous experiment. This comparison identifies several communally misregulated genes that are critical for cytoskeletal integrity and tissue permeability, including ANK3 and ANGPT1. Together, these results clarify how CDX2 dose-dependently regulates gene expression in the extraembryonic mesoderm and suggest these genes may underlie the defects in vascular development and allantoic elongation seen in the absence or reduction of CDX2 in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Arabidopsis thaliana sepals are excellent models for analyzing growth of entire organs due to their relatively small size, which can be captured at a cellular resolution under a confocal microscope [1]. To investigate how growth of different tissue layers generates unique organ morphologies, it is necessary to live-image deep into the tissue. However, imaging deep cell layers of the sepal is practically challenging, as it is hindered by the presence of extracellular air spaces between mesophyll cells, among other factors which causes optical aberrations. Image processing is also difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the deeper tissue layers, an issue mainly associated with live imaging datasets. Addressing some of these challenges, we provide an optimized methodology for live imaging sepals and subsequent image processing. This helps us track the growth of individual cells on the outer and inner epidermal layers, which are the key drivers of sepal morphogenesis. Results For live imaging sepals across all tissue layers at early stages of development, we found that the use of a bright fluorescent membrane marker, coupled with increased laser intensity and an enhanced Z- resolution produces high-quality images suitable for downstream image processing. Our optimized parameters allowed us to image the bottommost cell layer of the sepal (inner epidermal layer) without compromising viability. We used a voxel removal technique to visualize the inner epidermal layer in MorphoGraphX [2, 3] image processing software. Finally, we describe the process of optimizing the parameters for creating a 2.5D mesh surface for the inner epidermis. This allowed segmentation and parent tracking of individual cells through multiple time points, despite the weak signal of the inner epidermal cells. Conclusion We provide a robust pipeline for imaging and analyzing growth across inner and outer epidermal layers during early sepal development. Our approach can potentially be employed for analyzing growth of other internal cell layers of the sepals as well. For each of the steps, approaches, and parameters we used, we have provided in-depth explanations to help researchers understand the rationale and replicate our pipeline.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms adjust their physiology to cope with environmental fluctuations and maintain fitness. These adaptations occur via genetic changes over multiple generations or through acclimation, a set of reversible phenotypic changes that confer resilience to the individual. Aquatic organisms are subject to dramatic seasonal fluctuations in water salinity, which can affect the function of lateral line mechanosensory hair cells. To maintain hair cell function when salinity decreases, ion-regulating cells, Neuromast-associated ionocytes (Nm ionocytes), increase in number and invade lateral line neuromasts. How environmental changes trigger this adaptive differentiation of Nm ionocytes and how these cells are specified is still unknown. Here, we identify Nm ionocyte progenitors as foxi3a/foxi3b-expressing skin cells and show that their differentiation is associated with sequential activation of different Notch pathway components, which control ionocyte survival. We demonstrate that new Nm ionocytes are rapidly specified by absolute salinity levels, independently of stress response pathways. We further show that Nm ionocyte differentiation is selectively triggered by depletion of specific ions, such as Ca2&#43; and Na&#43;/Cl-, but not by low K&#43; levels, and is independent of media osmolarity. Finally, we demonstrate that hair cell activity plays a role in Nm ionocyte recruitment and that systemic factors are not necessary for Nm ionocyte induction. In summary, we have identified how environmental changes activate a signaling cascade that triggers basal skin cell progenitors to differentiate into Nm ionocytes and invade lateral line organs. This adaptive behavior is an example of physiological plasticity that may prove essential for survival in changing climates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundAdults born very preterm (i.e., at &lt;33 weeks gestation) are more susceptible to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional difficulties, compared to full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm vs full-term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth status).

MethodsThe Network Based Statistic approach was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity differentiating between i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57% female, respectively), and ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using consensus clustering (n= 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status, and in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. Post-hoc two-way group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes.

ResultsVery preterm compared to full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in subsections of the default mode, visual, and ventral attention networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles (irrespective of birth status), identified two data-driven subgroups: An &#34;At-risk&#34; subgroup, characterised by increased cognitive, mental health, and socio-emotional difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular regions, relative to a &#34;Resilient&#34; subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity.

ConclusionsFunctional connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups. We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localised functional connectivity alterations seen in the &#34;At-risk&#34; subgroup relative to the &#34;Resilient&#34; subgroup may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of birth status.</p>
