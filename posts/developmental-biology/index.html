A.; Mosimann, C.; Nakamura, T.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548949\nThe morphological transformation of the pectoral/shoulder girdle is fundamental to the water-to-land transition in vertebrate evolution. Although previous studies have resolved the embryonic origins of the tetrapod shoulder girdle, those of the fish pectoral girdle remain uncharacterized, creating a gap in the understanding of girdle transformation mechanisms from fish to modern tetrapods. Here, we identified the embryonic origins of the pectoral girdle of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including the cleithrum as an ancestral pectoral girdle element lost in extant tetrapods. Our combinatorial approach of photoconversion and genetic cell lineage tracing mapped that cleithrum development combines three adjoining embryonic populations: cranial neural crest cells and lateral plate mesoderm-derivatives (trunk lateral plate mesoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm-associated cells). The topographical position of the cleithrum at the head/trunk interface is a shared characteristic among cleithrum-bearing fish, thus its multiple embryonic origins are likely a conserved feature. Moreover, a comparison of the pectoral girdle progenitors between aquatic fish and extant amniotes suggests that cleithrum loss is associated with the disappearance of its unique developmental environment by the insertion of the neck lateral plate mesoderm into the head/trunk interface. Overall, our study establishes an embryological framework for pectoral/shoulder girdle formation and their evolutionary trajectories from their origin in water to diversification on land.\nJaw size variation is associated with a novel craniofacial function for galanin receptor 2 in an adaptive radiation of pupfishes\nAuthors: Palominos, M. F.; Muhl, V.; Richards, E. J.; Miller, C. T.; Martin, C. H.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.02.543513\nUnderstanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putative Sry transcription factor binding site in the upstream region of galr2 in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 expression among pupfish species in Meckels cartilage and premaxilla using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel function for Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to drugs that inhibit Galr2 activity. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckels cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression of galr2 due to the loss of a putative Sry binding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckels cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a postulated Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions.\nSpecialized mesenteric lymphatic capillaries by-pass the mesenteric lymph node chain to transport peritoneal antigens directly into mediastinal lymph nodes.\nAuthors: Redder, E.; Kirschnick, N.; Fang, S.; Kuhlmann, M.; Gonzalez-Loyola, A.; Wyss, T.; Stehling, M.; Adams, R. H.; Petrova, T. V.; Alitalo, K. K.; Rot, A.; Kiefer, F.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.11.548304\nLymphatic vessels (LVs) are indispensable for tissue fluid homeostasis and immune cell trafficking. The network of LVs that channel fluids from the gut into mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) has been recognized as the sole lymphatic system in the mesentery. Here we describe an alternative, functionally autonomous set of capillary mesenteric LVs (capMLVs) that by-pass the MLNs and drain directly into mediastinal LNs. CapMLVs develop perinatally from valves of collective mesenteric lymphatic vessels (colMLVs) in response to arterial endothelial cell-derived VEGF-C. Once extended, capMLVs detach from colMLVs to form an independent elongated network comprised of LYVE1+, CCL21+ endothelial cells. Avascular areas of the mesentery juxtaposed to capMLVs contain cell islets that express ACKR4. This CCL21-scavenging atypical receptor facilitates the migration of mesenteric phagocytes into capMLVs to be channeled directly into mediastinal LNs. This allows peritoneum-derived ominous antigens to be processed separately from alimentary antigens.\nAblation of OCT4 function in cattle embryos by double electroporation of CRISPR-Cas for DNA and RNA targeting (CRISPR-DART)\nAuthors: Nix, J. L.; Schettini, G.; Speckhart, S. L.; Ealy, A. D.; Biase, F. H.\nScore: 6.2, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548144\nCRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins are important tools for gene editing in pre-implantation embryos. However, the inefficient production of biallelic deletions in cattle zygotes has hindered mechanistic studies of gene function. In addition, the presence of maternal RNAs that support embryo development until embryonic genome activation may cause confounding phenotypes. Here, we aimed to improve the efficiency of biallelic deletions and deplete specific maternal RNAs in cattle zygotes using CRISPR-Cas editing technology. Two electroporation sessions with Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1 and the promoter of OCT4 produced biallelic deletions in 91% of the embryos tested. In most cases, the deletions were longer than 1000 nucleotides long. Electroporation of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins prevents the production of the corresponding proteins. We electroporated Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1, including the promoter region, of OCT4 in two sessions with inclusion of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins targeting OCT4 mRNAs in the second session to ablate OCT4 function in cattle embryos. A lack of OCT4 resulted in embryos arresting development prior to blastocyst formation at a greater proportion (13%) than controls (31.6%, P\u003c0.001). The few embryos that developed past the morula stage did not form a normal inner cell mass. Transcriptome analysis of single blastocysts, confirmed to lack exon 1 and promoter region of OCT4, revealed a significant (FDR\u003c0.1) reduction in transcript abundance of many genes functionally connected to stemness, including markers of pluripotency (CADHD1, DPPA4, GNL3, RRM2). The results confirm that OCT4 is key regulator of genes that modulate pluripotency and is required to form a functional blastocyst in cattle. Significance StatementCRISPR-Cas mediated DNA editing can revolutionize agriculture and biomedicine due to its simplicity of design and use. Modifications induced in embryos, though challenging to accomplish, are beneficial for the advancement of livestock production and the study of biological function. Here, we developed an approach using CRISPR-Cas enzymes to remove DNA segments of the cattle genome in one-cell embryos. Our results show major advancement in the efficiency of producing large deletions in the genome of cattle embryos. Using our approach, we removed the function of the OCT4 gene. Our results confirmed OCT4 as a major regulator of pluripotency genes during embryo development and its requirement for the formation of an inner cell mass in cattle.\nTissue tension permits β-catenin phosphorylation to drive mesoderm specification in human embryonic stem cells.\nAuthors: Ayad, N. M. E.; Lakins, J. N.; Ghagre, A.; Ehrlicher, A. J.; Weaver, V. M.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549074\nThe role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.\nMesenchymal Vangl facilitates airway elongation and widening independently of the planar cell polarity complex\nAuthors: Paramore, S. V.; Goodwin, K.; Devenport, D.; Nelson, C. M.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547543\nA hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.\nHif-2α programmes oxygen chemosensitivity in chromaffin cells\nAuthors: Prange-Barczynska, M.; Jones, H.; Sugimoto, Y.; Cheng, X.; Lima, J.; Ratnayaka, I.; Douglas, G.; Buckler, K.; Ratcliffe, P.; Keeley, T.; Bishop, T.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548982\nThe study of transcription factors that determine specialised neuronal functions has provided invaluable insights into the physiology of the nervous system. Peripheral chemoreceptors are neurone-like electro-physiologically excitable cells that link the oxygen content of arterial blood to the neuronal control of breathing. In the adult, this oxygen chemosensitivity is exemplified by the Type I cells of the carotid body and recent work has revealed one isoform of the transcription factor HIF, HIF-2, to have a non-redundant role in the development and function of that organ. Here we show that the activation of HIF-2, including isolated overexpression alone, is sufficient to induce oxygen chemosensitivity in the otherwise unresponsive adult adrenal medulla. This phenotypic change in the adrenal medulla was associated with retention of extra-adrenal paraganglioma-like tissues that resemble the foetal organ of Zuckerkandl and also manifest oxygen chemosensitivity. Acquisition of chemosensitivity was associated with changes in the adrenal medullary expression of classes of genes that are ordinarily characteristic of the carotid body, including G-protein regulators and atypical subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Overall, the findings suggest that, at least in certain tissues, HIF-2 acts as a phenotypic driver for cells that display oxygen chemosensitivity, providing a route to mechanistic understanding.\nA zebrafish knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor.\nAuthors: Suner, I. G.; Singh, S. P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.548093\nZebrafish is a powerful model organism for in vivo live imaging. However, protein visualization relies to this date on the overexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins from a specific promoter which very often does not recapitulate endogenous patterns of expression and dynamics. Tagging proteins in the endogenous locus is not widely used in the field due to its technical inefficiency and difficulty. Here we developed a knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor by inserting an EGFP-pA cassette in frame at the C-terminal generating a fusion protein. Foxo1a has been involved in the regulation of many biological processes regarding metabolism, stress response, longevity, cell differentiation and others and its functions are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. Using in-vivo live imaging at early developmental stages, we validated the expression in the cardiovascular network, CNS, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, retina, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. Our line opens the way for imaging studies aiming to characterize the expression and localization of this transcription factor in a tissue and context specific manner. Also, the knock-in line can be used in combination with other modern techniques to determine the transcriptional targets of Foxo1a, many of which remain unknown.\nThe transcription factor OCT6 promotes the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state by repressing Nanog and activating a formative state gene regulatory network.\nAuthors: Waisman, A.; Sevlever, F.; Saulnier, D.; Francia, M. G.; Lombardi, A.; Biani, M. C.; Palma, M. B.; Scarafia, A.; Smucler, J.; Amin, G.; La Greca, A.; Moro, L.; Sevlever, G. E.; Guberman, A.; Miriuka, S. G.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-07-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.13.548918\nAnimal development relies on complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the nearly irreversible changes that occur during cell differentiation. In this work we aimed to determine key transcription factors (TFs) associated with the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and the acquisition of a formative identity. We identified OCT6 as one of the earliest TFs induced during the onset of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) differentiation. To investigate its role, we generated an Oct6 knockout mESC line, which failed to acquire the characteristic cell morphology associated with the formative state. Transcriptome analysis of differentiating cells revealed nearly 300 differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type cells, including pluripotency TFs Nanog, Klf2, Nr5a2, Prdm14, and Esrrb, that failed to correctly downregulate. Notably, premature expression of OCT6 in naive cells triggered a rapid morphological transformation mirroring differentiation, accompanied by self-induction of Oct6 and expression of TFs such as Sox3, Zic2/3, Foxp1, as well as the formative genes Dnmt3A and FGF5. Strikingly, the majority of OCT6 expressing cells did not express NANOG. Gene expression and single molecule RNA-FISH analysis confirmed that this regulation was at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our results establish OCT6 as a key TF in the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and support a model where Oct6 and Nanog form a double negative feedback loop which could act as a toggle switch important for the transition to the formative state. HighlightsO_LIOct6 is rapidly induced as mESCs exit ground state pluripotency. C_LIO_LILoss of OCT6 negatively affects the transition to formative pluripotency. C_LIO_LIPremature expression of OCT6 in mESCs is sufficient to induce a formative-like phenotype. C_LIO_LIOCT6 and NANOG repress each other forming a double negative feedback loop. C_LI\nTgfbr1 controls developmental plasticity between the hindlimb and external genitalia by remodeling their regulatory landscape\nAuthors: Lozovska, A.; Korovesi, A. G.; Dias, A.; Lopes, A.; Fowler, D. A.; Martins, G. G.; Novoa, A.; Mallo, M.\nScore: 61.1, Published: 2023-07-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.548120\nThe hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species 1. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors 2-5. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The morphological transformation of the pectoral/shoulder girdle is fundamental to the water-to-land transition in vertebrate evolution. Although previous studies have resolved the embryonic origins of the tetrapod shoulder girdle, those of the fish pectoral girdle remain uncharacterized, creating a gap in the understanding of girdle transformation mechanisms from fish to modern tetrapods. Here, we identified the embryonic origins of the pectoral girdle of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including the cleithrum as an ancestral pectoral girdle element lost in extant tetrapods. Our combinatorial approach of photoconversion and genetic cell lineage tracing mapped that cleithrum development combines three adjoining embryonic populations: cranial neural crest cells and lateral plate mesoderm-derivatives (trunk lateral plate mesoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm-associated cells). The topographical position of the cleithrum at the head/trunk interface is a shared characteristic among cleithrum-bearing fish, thus its multiple embryonic origins are likely a conserved feature. Moreover, a comparison of the pectoral girdle progenitors between aquatic fish and extant amniotes suggests that cleithrum loss is associated with the disappearance of its unique developmental environment by the insertion of the neck lateral plate mesoderm into the head/trunk interface. Overall, our study establishes an embryological framework for pectoral/shoulder girdle formation and their evolutionary trajectories from their origin in water to diversification on land.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the genetic basis of novel adaptations in new species is a fundamental question in biology that also provides an opportunity to uncover new genes and regulatory networks with potential clinical relevance. Here we demonstrate a new role for galr2 in vertebrate craniofacial development using an adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island in the Bahamas. We confirmed the loss of a putative Sry transcription factor binding site in the upstream region of galr2 in scale-eating pupfish and found significant spatial differences in galr2 expression among pupfish species in Meckels cartilage and premaxilla using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We then experimentally demonstrated a novel function for Galr2 in craniofacial development and jaw elongation by exposing embryos to drugs that inhibit Galr2 activity. Galr2-inhibition reduced Meckels cartilage length and increased chondrocyte density in both trophic specialists but not in the generalist genetic background. We propose a mechanism for jaw elongation in scale-eaters based on the reduced expression of galr2 due to the loss of a putative Sry binding site. Fewer Galr2 receptors in the scale-eater Meckels cartilage may result in their enlarged jaw lengths as adults by limiting opportunities for a postulated Galr2 agonist to bind to these receptors during development. Our findings illustrate the growing utility of linking candidate adaptive SNPs in non-model systems with highly divergent phenotypes to novel vertebrate gene functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lymphatic vessels (LVs) are indispensable for tissue fluid homeostasis and immune cell trafficking. The network of LVs that channel fluids from the gut into mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) has been recognized as the sole lymphatic system in the mesentery. Here we describe an alternative, functionally autonomous set of capillary mesenteric LVs (capMLVs) that by-pass the MLNs and drain directly into mediastinal LNs. CapMLVs develop perinatally from valves of collective mesenteric lymphatic vessels (colMLVs) in response to arterial endothelial cell-derived VEGF-C. Once extended, capMLVs detach from colMLVs to form an independent elongated network comprised of LYVE1&#43;, CCL21&#43; endothelial cells. Avascular areas of the mesentery juxtaposed to capMLVs contain cell islets that express ACKR4. This CCL21-scavenging atypical receptor facilitates the migration of mesenteric phagocytes into capMLVs to be channeled directly into mediastinal LNs. This allows peritoneum-derived ominous antigens to be processed separately from alimentary antigens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoproteins are important tools for gene editing in pre-implantation embryos. However, the inefficient production of biallelic deletions in cattle zygotes has hindered mechanistic studies of gene function. In addition, the presence of maternal RNAs that support embryo development until embryonic genome activation may cause confounding phenotypes. Here, we aimed to improve the efficiency of biallelic deletions and deplete specific maternal RNAs in cattle zygotes using CRISPR-Cas editing technology. Two electroporation sessions with Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1 and the promoter of OCT4 produced biallelic deletions in 91% of the embryos tested. In most cases, the deletions were longer than 1000 nucleotides long. Electroporation of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins prevents the production of the corresponding proteins. We electroporated Cas9D10A ribonucleoproteins targeting exon 1, including the promoter region, of OCT4 in two sessions with inclusion of Cas13a ribonucleoproteins targeting OCT4 mRNAs in the second session to ablate OCT4 function in cattle embryos. A lack of OCT4 resulted in embryos arresting development prior to blastocyst formation at a greater proportion (13%) than controls (31.6%, P&lt;0.001). The few embryos that developed past the morula stage did not form a normal inner cell mass. Transcriptome analysis of single blastocysts, confirmed to lack exon 1 and promoter region of OCT4, revealed a significant (FDR&lt;0.1) reduction in transcript abundance of many genes functionally connected to stemness, including markers of pluripotency (CADHD1, DPPA4, GNL3, RRM2). The results confirm that OCT4 is key regulator of genes that modulate pluripotency and is required to form a functional blastocyst in cattle.

Significance StatementCRISPR-Cas mediated DNA editing can revolutionize agriculture and biomedicine due to its simplicity of design and use. Modifications induced in embryos, though challenging to accomplish, are beneficial for the advancement of livestock production and the study of biological function. Here, we developed an approach using CRISPR-Cas enzymes to remove DNA segments of the cattle genome in one-cell embryos. Our results show major advancement in the efficiency of producing large deletions in the genome of cattle embryos. Using our approach, we removed the function of the OCT4 gene. Our results confirmed OCT4 as a major regulator of pluripotency genes during embryo development and its requirement for the formation of an inner cell mass in cattle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The study of transcription factors that determine specialised neuronal functions has provided invaluable insights into the physiology of the nervous system. Peripheral chemoreceptors are neurone-like electro-physiologically excitable cells that link the oxygen content of arterial blood to the neuronal control of breathing. In the adult, this oxygen chemosensitivity is exemplified by the Type I cells of the carotid body and recent work has revealed one isoform of the transcription factor HIF, HIF-2, to have a non-redundant role in the development and function of that organ. Here we show that the activation of HIF-2, including isolated overexpression alone, is sufficient to induce oxygen chemosensitivity in the otherwise unresponsive adult adrenal medulla. This phenotypic change in the adrenal medulla was associated with retention of extra-adrenal paraganglioma-like tissues that resemble the foetal organ of Zuckerkandl and also manifest oxygen chemosensitivity. Acquisition of chemosensitivity was associated with changes in the adrenal medullary expression of classes of genes that are ordinarily characteristic of the carotid body, including G-protein regulators and atypical subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Overall, the findings suggest that, at least in certain tissues, HIF-2 acts as a phenotypic driver for cells that display oxygen chemosensitivity, providing a route to mechanistic understanding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zebrafish is a powerful model organism for in vivo live imaging. However, protein visualization relies to this date on the overexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins from a specific promoter which very often does not recapitulate endogenous patterns of expression and dynamics. Tagging proteins in the endogenous locus is not widely used in the field due to its technical inefficiency and difficulty. Here we developed a knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor by inserting an EGFP-pA cassette in frame at the C-terminal generating a fusion protein. Foxo1a has been involved in the regulation of many biological processes regarding metabolism, stress response, longevity, cell differentiation and others and its functions are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. Using in-vivo live imaging at early developmental stages, we validated the expression in the cardiovascular network, CNS, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, retina, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. Our line opens the way for imaging studies aiming to characterize the expression and localization of this transcription factor in a tissue and context specific manner. Also, the knock-in line can be used in combination with other modern techniques to determine the transcriptional targets of Foxo1a, many of which remain unknown.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animal development relies on complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the nearly irreversible changes that occur during cell differentiation. In this work we aimed to determine key transcription factors (TFs) associated with the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and the acquisition of a formative identity. We identified OCT6 as one of the earliest TFs induced during the onset of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) differentiation. To investigate its role, we generated an Oct6 knockout mESC line, which failed to acquire the characteristic cell morphology associated with the formative state. Transcriptome analysis of differentiating cells revealed nearly 300 differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type cells, including pluripotency TFs Nanog, Klf2, Nr5a2, Prdm14, and Esrrb, that failed to correctly downregulate. Notably, premature expression of OCT6 in naive cells triggered a rapid morphological transformation mirroring differentiation, accompanied by self-induction of Oct6 and expression of TFs such as Sox3, Zic2/3, Foxp1, as well as the formative genes Dnmt3A and FGF5. Strikingly, the majority of OCT6 expressing cells did not express NANOG. Gene expression and single molecule RNA-FISH analysis confirmed that this regulation was at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our results establish OCT6 as a key TF in the dissolution of the naive pluripotent state and support a model where Oct6 and Nanog form a double negative feedback loop which could act as a toggle switch important for the transition to the formative state.

HighlightsO_LIOct6 is rapidly induced as mESCs exit ground state pluripotency.
C_LIO_LILoss of OCT6 negatively affects the transition to formative pluripotency.
C_LIO_LIPremature expression of OCT6 in mESCs is sufficient to induce a formative-like phenotype.
C_LIO_LIOCT6 and NANOG repress each other forming a double negative feedback loop.

        <p class="abstract">The hindlimb and external genitalia of present-day tetrapods are thought to derive from an ancestral common primordium that evolved to generate a wide diversity of structures adapted for efficient locomotion and mating in the ecological niche conquered by the species 1. We show that despite long evolutionary distance from the ancestral condition, the early primordium of the mouse external genitalia preserved the capacity to take hindlimb fates. In the absence of Tgfbr1, the pericloacal mesoderm generates an extra pair of hindlimbs at the expense of the external genitalia. It has been shown that the hindlimb and the genital primordia share many of their key regulatory factors 2-5. Tgfbr1 controls the response to those factors acting in a pioneer-like mode to modulate the accessibility status of regulatory elements that control the gene regulatory networks leading to the formation of genital or hindlimb structures. Our work uncovers a remarkable tissue plasticity with potential implications in the evolution of the hindlimb/genital area of tetrapods, and identifies a novel mechanism for Tgfbr1 activity that might also contribute to the control of other physiological or pathological processes.</p>
