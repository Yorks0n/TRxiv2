A.; Mosimann, C.; Nakamura, T.\nScore: 19.4, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548949\nThe morphological transformation of the pectoral/shoulder girdle is fundamental to the water-to-land transition in vertebrate evolution. Although previous studies have resolved the embryonic origins of the tetrapod shoulder girdle, those of the fish pectoral girdle remain uncharacterized, creating a gap in the understanding of girdle transformation mechanisms from fish to modern tetrapods. Here, we identified the embryonic origins of the pectoral girdle of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including the cleithrum as an ancestral pectoral girdle element lost in extant tetrapods. Our combinatorial approach of photoconversion and genetic cell lineage tracing mapped that cleithrum development combines three adjoining embryonic populations: cranial neural crest cells and lateral plate mesoderm-derivatives (trunk lateral plate mesoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm-associated cells). The topographical position of the cleithrum at the head/trunk interface is a shared characteristic among cleithrum-bearing fish, thus its multiple embryonic origins are likely a conserved feature. Moreover, a comparison of the pectoral girdle progenitors between aquatic fish and extant amniotes suggests that cleithrum loss is associated with the disappearance of its unique developmental environment by the insertion of the neck lateral plate mesoderm into the head/trunk interface. Overall, our study establishes an embryological framework for pectoral/shoulder girdle formation and their evolutionary trajectories from their origin in water to diversification on land.\nPax37 gene function in Oikopleura dioica supports a neuroepithelial-like origin for its house-making Fol territory\nAuthors: Lagman, D.; Leon, A.; Cieminska, N.; Deng, W.; Chatzigeorgiou, M.; Henriet, S.; Chourrout, D.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549157\nLarvacean tunicates feature a spectacular innovation not seen in other animals - the trunk oikoplastic epithelium (OE). This epithelium produces a house, a large and complex extracellular structure used for filtering and concentrating food particles. Previously we have shown that several homeobox transcription factors may play a role in patterning the OE. Among these are two Pax3/7 duplicates that we named Pax37A and Pax37B. The vertebrate homologs, PAX3 and PAX7, are involved in developmental processes related to neural crest and muscles. In the ascidian tunicate Ciona robusta, Pax3/7 has been given a role in development of cells deriving from the neural plate border including trunk epidermal sensory neurons and tail nerve cord neurons as well as in neural tube closure. Here we have investigated the roles of Pax37A and Pax37B in the development of the OE using CRISPR-Cas9, analyzing scRNA-seq data from wild-type animals that were compared with scRNA-seq data from C. robusta. We revealed that Pax37B but not Pax37A is essential for the differentiation of cell fields that produce the food concentrating filter of the house: the anterior Fol, giant Fol and Nasse cells. Lineage analysis supports that expression of Pax37 is under influence of Wnt signaling and that Fol cells have a neuroepithelial-like transcriptional signature. We propose that the highly specialized secretory epithelial cells of the Fol region either maintained or evolved neuroepithelial features as do \"glue\" secreting collocytes of ascidians. Their development seems to be controlled by a GRN that also operates in some ascidian neurons.\nThe piRNA protein Asz1 is essential for germ cell and gonad development in in zebrafish and exhibits differential necessities in distinct types of RNP granules\nAuthors: Ahmad, A.; Bogoch, Y.; Shvaizer, G.; Elkouby, Y. M.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549483\nGerm cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology. Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.\nERK signalling orchestrates metachronous transition from naive to formative pluripotency\nAuthors: Mulas, C.; Stammers, M.; Salomaa, S. I.; Heinzen, C.; Suter, D. M.; Smith, A.; Chalut, K. J.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549835\nNaive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.\nCoordination of cell cycle and morphogenesis during organ formation\nAuthors: Matthew, J.; Vishwakarma, V.; Le, T. P.; Agsunod, R. A.; Chung, S.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549944\nOrgan formation requires precise regulation of cell cycle and morphogenetic events. Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The hkb mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas hkb mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of cyclin E or cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or overexpression of fizzy-related rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the hkb mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.\nTissue tension permits β-catenin phosphorylation to drive mesoderm specification in human embryonic stem cells.\nAuthors: Ayad, N. M. E.; Lakins, J. N.; Ghagre, A.; Ehrlicher, A. J.; Weaver, V. M.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549074\nThe role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.\nMesenchymal Vangl facilitates airway elongation and widening independently of the planar cell polarity complex\nAuthors: Paramore, S. V.; Goodwin, K.; Devenport, D.; Nelson, C. M.\nScore: 19.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547543\nA hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.\nBMP-dependent patterning of ectoderm tissue material properties modulates lateral mesendoderm cell migration during early zebrafish gastrulation\nAuthors: Tavano, S.; Brueckner, D. B.; Tasciyan, S.; Tong, X.; Kardos, R.; Schauer, A.; Hauschild, R.; Heisenberg, C.-P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.21.550024\nCell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.\nA zebrafish knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor.\nAuthors: Suner, I. G.; Singh, S. P.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-07-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.17.548093\nZebrafish is a powerful model organism for in vivo live imaging. However, protein visualization relies to this date on the overexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins from a specific promoter which very often does not recapitulate endogenous patterns of expression and dynamics. Tagging proteins in the endogenous locus is not widely used in the field due to its technical inefficiency and difficulty. Here we developed a knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor by inserting an EGFP-pA cassette in frame at the C-terminal generating a fusion protein. Foxo1a has been involved in the regulation of many biological processes regarding metabolism, stress response, longevity, cell differentiation and others and its functions are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. Using in-vivo live imaging at early developmental stages, we validated the expression in the cardiovascular network, CNS, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, retina, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. Our line opens the way for imaging studies aiming to characterize the expression and localization of this transcription factor in a tissue and context specific manner. Also, the knock-in line can be used in combination with other modern techniques to determine the transcriptional targets of Foxo1a, many of which remain unknown.\nHif-2α programmes oxygen chemosensitivity in chromaffin cells\nAuthors: Prange-Barczynska, M.; Jones, H.; Sugimoto, Y.; Cheng, X.; Lima, J.; Ratnayaka, I.; Douglas, G.; Buckler, K.; Ratcliffe, P.; Keeley, T.; Bishop, T.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.548982\nThe study of transcription factors that determine specialised neuronal functions has provided invaluable insights into the physiology of the nervous system. Peripheral chemoreceptors are neurone-like electro-physiologically excitable cells that link the oxygen content of arterial blood to the neuronal control of breathing. In the adult, this oxygen chemosensitivity is exemplified by the Type I cells of the carotid body and recent work has revealed one isoform of the transcription factor HIF, HIF-2, to have a non-redundant role in the development and function of that organ. Here we show that the activation of HIF-2, including isolated overexpression alone, is sufficient to induce oxygen chemosensitivity in the otherwise unresponsive adult adrenal medulla. This phenotypic change in the adrenal medulla was associated with retention of extra-adrenal paraganglioma-like tissues that resemble the foetal organ of Zuckerkandl and also manifest oxygen chemosensitivity. Acquisition of chemosensitivity was associated with changes in the adrenal medullary expression of classes of genes that are ordinarily characteristic of the carotid body, including G-protein regulators and atypical subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Overall, the findings suggest that, at least in certain tissues, HIF-2 acts as a phenotypic driver for cells that display oxygen chemosensitivity, providing a route to mechanistic understanding.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The morphological transformation of the pectoral/shoulder girdle is fundamental to the water-to-land transition in vertebrate evolution. Although previous studies have resolved the embryonic origins of the tetrapod shoulder girdle, those of the fish pectoral girdle remain uncharacterized, creating a gap in the understanding of girdle transformation mechanisms from fish to modern tetrapods. Here, we identified the embryonic origins of the pectoral girdle of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including the cleithrum as an ancestral pectoral girdle element lost in extant tetrapods. Our combinatorial approach of photoconversion and genetic cell lineage tracing mapped that cleithrum development combines three adjoining embryonic populations: cranial neural crest cells and lateral plate mesoderm-derivatives (trunk lateral plate mesoderm and cardiopharyngeal mesoderm-associated cells). The topographical position of the cleithrum at the head/trunk interface is a shared characteristic among cleithrum-bearing fish, thus its multiple embryonic origins are likely a conserved feature. Moreover, a comparison of the pectoral girdle progenitors between aquatic fish and extant amniotes suggests that cleithrum loss is associated with the disappearance of its unique developmental environment by the insertion of the neck lateral plate mesoderm into the head/trunk interface. Overall, our study establishes an embryological framework for pectoral/shoulder girdle formation and their evolutionary trajectories from their origin in water to diversification on land.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Larvacean tunicates feature a spectacular innovation not seen in other animals - the trunk oikoplastic epithelium (OE). This epithelium produces a house, a large and complex extracellular structure used for filtering and concentrating food particles. Previously we have shown that several homeobox transcription factors may play a role in patterning the OE. Among these are two Pax3/7 duplicates that we named Pax37A and Pax37B. The vertebrate homologs, PAX3 and PAX7, are involved in developmental processes related to neural crest and muscles. In the ascidian tunicate Ciona robusta, Pax3/7 has been given a role in development of cells deriving from the neural plate border including trunk epidermal sensory neurons and tail nerve cord neurons as well as in neural tube closure. Here we have investigated the roles of Pax37A and Pax37B in the development of the OE using CRISPR-Cas9, analyzing scRNA-seq data from wild-type animals that were compared with scRNA-seq data from C. robusta. We revealed that Pax37B but not Pax37A is essential for the differentiation of cell fields that produce the food concentrating filter of the house: the anterior Fol, giant Fol and Nasse cells. Lineage analysis supports that expression of Pax37 is under influence of Wnt signaling and that Fol cells have a neuroepithelial-like transcriptional signature. We propose that the highly specialized secretory epithelial cells of the Fol region either maintained or evolved neuroepithelial features as do &#34;glue&#34; secreting collocytes of ascidians. Their development seems to be controlled by a GRN that also operates in some ascidian neurons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germ cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology.

Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Naive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organ formation requires precise regulation of cell cycle and morphogenetic events. Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The hkb mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas hkb mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of cyclin E or cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or overexpression of fizzy-related rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the hkb mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A hallmark of mammalian lungs is the fractal nature of the bronchial tree. In the adult, each successive generation of airways is a fraction of the size of the parental branch. This fractal structure is physiologically beneficial, as it minimizes the energy needed for breathing. Achieving this pattern likely requires precise control of airway length and diameter, as the branches of the embryonic airways initially lack the fractal scaling observed in those of the adult lung. In epithelial monolayers and tubes, directional growth can be regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) complex. Here, we comprehensively characterized the roles of PCP-complex components in airway initiation, elongation, and widening during branching morphogenesis of the murine lung. Using tissue-specific knockout mice, we surprisingly found that branching morphogenesis proceeds independently of PCP-component expression in the developing airway epithelium. Instead, we found a novel, Celsr1-independent role for the PCP component Vangl in the pulmonary mesenchyme. Specifically, mesenchymal loss of Vangl1/2 leads to defects in branch initiation, elongation, and widening. At the cellular level, we observe changes in the shape of smooth muscle cells that indicate a potential defect in collective mesenchymal rearrangements, which we hypothesize are necessary for lung morphogenesis. Our data thus reveal an explicit function for Vangl that is independent of the core PCP complex, suggesting a functional diversification of PCP components in vertebrate development. These data also reveal an essential role for the embryonic mesenchyme in generating the fractal structure of airways of the mature lung.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zebrafish is a powerful model organism for in vivo live imaging. However, protein visualization relies to this date on the overexpression of fluorescently tagged proteins from a specific promoter which very often does not recapitulate endogenous patterns of expression and dynamics. Tagging proteins in the endogenous locus is not widely used in the field due to its technical inefficiency and difficulty. Here we developed a knock-in reporter line for the Foxo1a transcription factor by inserting an EGFP-pA cassette in frame at the C-terminal generating a fusion protein. Foxo1a has been involved in the regulation of many biological processes regarding metabolism, stress response, longevity, cell differentiation and others and its functions are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates. Using in-vivo live imaging at early developmental stages, we validated the expression in the cardiovascular network, CNS, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, retina, skeletal muscle, and myocardium. Our line opens the way for imaging studies aiming to characterize the expression and localization of this transcription factor in a tissue and context specific manner. Also, the knock-in line can be used in combination with other modern techniques to determine the transcriptional targets of Foxo1a, many of which remain unknown.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The study of transcription factors that determine specialised neuronal functions has provided invaluable insights into the physiology of the nervous system. Peripheral chemoreceptors are neurone-like electro-physiologically excitable cells that link the oxygen content of arterial blood to the neuronal control of breathing. In the adult, this oxygen chemosensitivity is exemplified by the Type I cells of the carotid body and recent work has revealed one isoform of the transcription factor HIF, HIF-2, to have a non-redundant role in the development and function of that organ. Here we show that the activation of HIF-2, including isolated overexpression alone, is sufficient to induce oxygen chemosensitivity in the otherwise unresponsive adult adrenal medulla. This phenotypic change in the adrenal medulla was associated with retention of extra-adrenal paraganglioma-like tissues that resemble the foetal organ of Zuckerkandl and also manifest oxygen chemosensitivity. Acquisition of chemosensitivity was associated with changes in the adrenal medullary expression of classes of genes that are ordinarily characteristic of the carotid body, including G-protein regulators and atypical subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. Overall, the findings suggest that, at least in certain tissues, HIF-2 acts as a phenotypic driver for cells that display oxygen chemosensitivity, providing a route to mechanistic understanding.</p>
