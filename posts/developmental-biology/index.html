A.; Moshe, N.; Safriel, S. R.; Chen, A.; Ruiz De Almodovar, C.; Yaniv, K.\nScore: 19.2, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559123\nThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination. Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited. Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes. Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.\nThe Chordate Origins of Heart Regeneration\nAuthors: Schuster, K. J.; Christiaen, L.\nScore: 17.7, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558507\nThe human heart is infamous for not healing after infarction in adults, prompting biomedical interest in species that can regenerate damaged hearts. In such animals as zebrafish and neonatal mice, cardiac repair relies on remaining heart tissue supporting cardiomyocyte proliferation. Natural de novo cardiogenesis in post-embryonic stages thus remains elusive. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona, an ascidian among the closest living relatives to the vertebrates, can survive complete chemogenetic ablation of the heart and loss of cardiac function, and recover both cardiac tissue and contractility. As in vertebrates, Ciona heart regeneration relies on Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling-dependent proliferation of cardiomyocytes, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of regenerative cardiogenesis in chordates. Remarkably, prospective lineage tracing by photoconversion of the fluorescent protein Kaede suggested that new cardiomyocytes can emerge from endodermal lineages in post-metamorphic animals, providing an unprecedented case of regenerative de novo cardiogenesis. Finally, while embryos cannot compensate for early losses of the cardiogenic lineage, forming heartless juveniles, developing animals gain their regenerative ability during metamorphosis, uncovering a fundamental transition between deterministic embryogenesis and regulative post-embryonic development.\nCartoCell, a high-content pipeline for 3D image analysis, unveils cell morphology patterns in epithelia.\nAuthors: Andres-San Roman, J.

P.; Martin-Belmonte, F.; Annese, V.; Gomez-Galvez, P.; Arganda-Carreras, I.; Escudero, L. M.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.01.05.522724\nDecades of research have not yet fully explained the mechanisms of epithelial self-organization and 3D packing. Single-cell analysis of large 3D epithelial libraries is crucial for understanding the assembly and function of whole tissues. Combining 3D epithelial imaging with advanced deep learning segmentation methods is essential for enabling this high-content analysis. We introduce CartoCell, a deep learning-based pipeline that uses small datasets to generate accurate labels for hundreds of whole 3D epithelial cysts. Our method detects the realistic morphology of epithelial cells and their contacts in the 3D structure of the tissue. CartoCell enables the quantification of geometric and packing features at the cellular level. Our Single-cell Cartography approach then maps the distribution of these features on 2D plots and 3D surface maps, revealing cell morphology patterns in epithelial cysts. Additionally, we show that CartoCell can be adapted to other types of epithelial tissues. MOTIVATIONA major bottleneck in developing neural networks for cell segmentation is the need for labor-intensive manual curation in order to develop a training dataset. The present work addresses this limitation by developing an automated image analysis pipeline that utilizes small datasets to generate accurate labels of cells in complex, 3D epithelial contexts. The overall goal is to provide an automatic and feasible method to achieve high-quality epithelial reconstructions and to enable high-content analysis of morphological features, which can improve our understanding of how these tissues self-organize.\nARID3A coordinates the proliferation-differentiation switch of transit-amplifying cells in the intestine\nAuthors: Angelis, N.; Baulies, A.; Kucharska, A.; Kelly, G.; Sopena, M.; Boeing, S.; Li, V. S. W.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-09-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.559311\nIntestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the crypt base divide and give rise to progenitor cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into various mature epithelial cell types in the transit-amplifying (TA) zone. Here, we identified the transcription factor ARID3A as a novel regulator of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation at the TA compartment. We show that ARID3A forms an expression gradient from villus tip to the early progenitors at the crypts mediated by TGF-{beta} and WNT signalling. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Arid3a reduces proliferation of TA cells. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis shows increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced secretory cells in the Arid3a cKO intestine. Interestingly, upper-villus gene signatures of both enterocytes and secretory cells are enriched in the mutant intestine. We find that the enhanced enterocyte differentiation in the Arid3a cKO intestine is caused by increased binding of HNF1 and HNF4. Finally, we show that loss of Arid3a impairs irradiation-induced regenerative process by altering the dynamics of proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings imply that ARID3A may play a gatekeeping role in the TA compartment to maintain the \"just-right\" proliferation-to-differentiation ratio for tissue homeostasis and plasticity.\nSensitivity of the timing of Drosophila pupal wing morphogenesis to external perturbations\nAuthors: Piscitello-Gomez, R.; Mahmoud, A.; Dye, N. A.; Eaton, S.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558969\nThe morphogenesis of the pupal wing of Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model for understanding the physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis. During this process, the wing undergoes a dramatic reshaping where the hinge region contracts and pulls on the blade region, triggering a dynamic pattern of cell elongation changes, cell divisions, and cell neighborhood changes Etournay et al. (2015). Over our several year study of this process, we noticed that sometime after the year 2016, the onset of morphogenesis became consistently delayed by [~]6 h compared to previous years. Thus, the peak of cell elongation was now observed at 28 hours after puparium formation (hAPF) rather than at 20-22 hAPF. We show here that this delay is independent of genetic background and that the speed of the overall process is relatively unchanged, implying that an environmental factor causes a shift in the onset of the process relative to the start of pupariation. We then investigated how various environmental factors influence the timing of pupal wing morphogenesis, using the dynamics of cell elongation as a proxy. We find that imaging conditions, temperature, diet, Wolbachia infection, and the light/dark cycle have relatively little effect. Preliminary data show that the spectra of light used to rear the flies affects cell elongation dynamics, although the delay was not completely reverted and more experiments are needed to know precisely how this variable affects morphogenesis. In sum, our work suggests the presence of a gate controlling the onset of pupal wing morphogenesis that is influenced by a specific, yet unclear, environmental factor. Once the gate is released, pupal wing morphogenesis occurs at a fairly constant rate, remarkably robust to many environmental variables.\nAtypical heat shock transcription factor HSF5 is critical for male meiotic prophase under non-stress conditions\nAuthors: Yoshimura, S.; Shimada, R.; Kikuchi, K.; Kawagoe, S.; Abe, H.; Iisaka, S.; Fujimura, S.; Yasunaga, K.-i.; Usuki, S.; Tani, N.; Ohba, T.; Kondoh, E.; Saio, T.; Araki, K.; Ishiguro, K.-i.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.557986\nMeiotic prophase progression is differently regulated in males and females. In males, pachytene transition during meiotic prophase is accompanied by robust alteration in gene expression. However, how gene expression is regulated differently to ensure meiotic prophase completion in males remains elusive. Herein, we identified HSF5 as a male germ cell-specific heat shock transcription factor (HSF) for meiotic prophase progression. Genetic analyses and single-cell RNA-sequencing demonstrated that HSF5 is essential for progression beyond the pachytene stage under non-stress conditions rather than heat stress. Chromatin binding analysis in vivo and DNA-binding assays in vitro suggested that HSF5 binds to promoters in a subset of genes associated with chromatin organization. HSF5 recognizes a DNA motif different from typical heat shock elements recognized by other canonical HSFs. This study suggests that HSF5 is an atypical HSF that enforces the gene expression program for pachytene transition during meiotic prophase in males.\nSystematic Perturbation of Thousands of Retroviral LTRs in Mouse Embryos\nAuthors: Yang, J.; Cook, L.; Chen, Z.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558531\nIn mammals, many retrotransposons are de-repressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, their functions in early development remain elusive largely due to the challenge to simultaneously manipulate thousands of retrotransposon insertions in embryos. Here, we employed epigenome editing to perturb the long terminal repeat (LTR) MT2_Mm, a well-known ZGA and totipotency marker that exists in [~]2667 insertions throughout the mouse genome. CRISPRi robustly repressed 2485 ([~] 93%) MT2_Mm insertions and 1090 ([~]55%) insertions of the closely related MT2C_Mm in 2-cell embryos. Remarkably, such perturbation caused down-regulation of hundreds of ZGA genes at the 2-cell stage and embryonic arrest mostly at the morula stage. Mechanistically, MT2_Mm/MT2C_Mm primarily served as alternative ZGA promoters activated by OBOX proteins. Thus, through unprecedented large-scale epigenome editing, we addressed to what extent MT2_Mm/MT2C_Mm regulates ZGA and preimplantation development. Our approach could be adapted to systematically perturb retrotransposons in other mammalian embryos as it doesnt require transgenic animals.\nHand2 represses non-cardiac cell fates through chromatin remodeling at cis-regulatory elements\nAuthors: Komatsu, V.; Cooper, B. H.; Yim, P.; Chan, K.; Gong, W.; Wheatley, L.; Rohs, R.; Fraser, S. E.; Trinh, L. A.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-09-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.23.559156\nDevelopmental studies have revealed the importance of the transcription factor Hand2 in cardiac development. Hand2 promotes cardiac progenitor differentiation and epithelial maturation, while repressing other tissue types. The mechanisms underlying the promotion of cardiac fates are far better understood than those underlying the repression of alternative fates. Here, we assess Hand2-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac progenitors of zebrafish embryos. Cell-type specific transcriptome analysis shows a dual function for Hand2 in activation of cardiac differentiation genes and repression of pronephric pathways. We identify functional cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility are increased in hand2 mutant cells. These regulatory elements associate with non-cardiac gene expression, and drive reporter gene expression in tissues associated with Hand2-repressed genes. We find that functional Hand2 is sufficient to reduce non-cardiac reporter expression in cardiac lineages. Taken together, our data support a model of Hand2-dependent coordination of transcriptional programs, not only through transcriptional activation of cardiac and epithelial maturation genes, but also through repressive chromatin remodeling at the DNA regulatory elements of non-cardiac genes.\nPCP and Septins govern the polarized organization of the actin cytoskeleton during convergent extension.\nAuthors: Devitt, C. C.; Weng, S.; Bejar-Padilla, V. D.; Alvarado, J.; Wallingford, J. B.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2022.06.06.495000\nActin is generally required for cell movement but must be brought under the control of distinct developmental systems to drive specific morphogenetic processes, such as convergent extension (CE)1. This evolutionarily conserved collective cell movement elongates the body axis of all vertebrates and is governed by the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling system 1,2. Here, we sought to understand the interplay of PCP and actin during Xenopus CE. Our data provide new insights into the organization and emergence of polarity in this network and reveal new roles for the actin organizing Septins 3, thereby shedding light on the mechanisms by which developmental signaling systems exploit the ubiquitous machinery of cells to drive morphogenesis.\nBMP signaling pathway member expression is enriched in enteric neural progenitors and required for zebrafish enteric nervous system development\nAuthors: Moore, J. A.; Noah, A. S.; Singleton, E. W.; Uribe, R. A.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.24.559191\nThe vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb+ enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex structure comprising neurons, glia, and pericytes that interact with specialized endothelial cells to maintain cerebral homeostasis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Alterations to NVU formation and function can lead to serious forms of cerebrovascular disease, including cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), a range of pathological changes of cerebral capillaries within the white matter contributing to BBB dysfunction and demyelination. Despite the growing recognition of the pivotal roles played by neuro-vascular and glia-vascular interfaces in NVU formation and functioning, CSVD research has mainly focused on characterizing pericyte and EC dysfunction, leaving our understanding of the contribution of non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma limited. Here, we use a novel zebrafish mutant to delve into the intricate interplay among NVU components and demonstrate how the compromised specification of a progenitor cell population sets off a cascade of events, ultimately leading to severe cerebrovascular abnormalities. The mutation affects Scavenger Receptor B2 (scarb2)/Lysosomal Membrane Protein 2 (limp2), a highly conserved protein residing in the membrane of late endosomes and lysosomes. We find Scarb2 to be predominantly expressed in Radial Glia Cells (RGCs), a multipotent cell giving rise to neurons and glia in both zebrafish and mammals. Through live imaging and genetic manipulations, we identify impaired Notch3 signaling in RGCs and their glial progeny as the primary consequence of Scarb2a depletion and show that this disruption causes excessive neurogenesis at the expense of glial cell differentiation. We further pinpoint compromised acidification of the endolysosomal compartment in mutant cells as the underlying cause of disrupted Notch3 processing, linking for the first time Notch3 defects in non-vascular cells of the brain parenchyma to CSVD phenotypes. Given the evolutionary conservation of SCARB2 expression and the remarkable recapitulation of CSVD phenotypes, scarb2 mutants provide a promising framework for investigating the mechanisms governing Notch3 processing in non-vascular cells and their involvement in the onset of CSVD.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human heart is infamous for not healing after infarction in adults, prompting biomedical interest in species that can regenerate damaged hearts. In such animals as zebrafish and neonatal mice, cardiac repair relies on remaining heart tissue supporting cardiomyocyte proliferation. Natural de novo cardiogenesis in post-embryonic stages thus remains elusive. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona, an ascidian among the closest living relatives to the vertebrates, can survive complete chemogenetic ablation of the heart and loss of cardiac function, and recover both cardiac tissue and contractility. As in vertebrates, Ciona heart regeneration relies on Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling-dependent proliferation of cardiomyocytes, providing insights into the evolutionary origins of regenerative cardiogenesis in chordates. Remarkably, prospective lineage tracing by photoconversion of the fluorescent protein Kaede suggested that new cardiomyocytes can emerge from endodermal lineages in post-metamorphic animals, providing an unprecedented case of regenerative de novo cardiogenesis. Finally, while embryos cannot compensate for early losses of the cardiogenic lineage, forming heartless juveniles, developing animals gain their regenerative ability during metamorphosis, uncovering a fundamental transition between deterministic embryogenesis and regulative post-embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Decades of research have not yet fully explained the mechanisms of epithelial self-organization and 3D packing. Single-cell analysis of large 3D epithelial libraries is crucial for understanding the assembly and function of whole tissues. Combining 3D epithelial imaging with advanced deep learning segmentation methods is essential for enabling this high-content analysis. We introduce CartoCell, a deep learning-based pipeline that uses small datasets to generate accurate labels for hundreds of whole 3D epithelial cysts. Our method detects the realistic morphology of epithelial cells and their contacts in the 3D structure of the tissue. CartoCell enables the quantification of geometric and packing features at the cellular level. Our Single-cell Cartography approach then maps the distribution of these features on 2D plots and 3D surface maps, revealing cell morphology patterns in epithelial cysts. Additionally, we show that CartoCell can be adapted to other types of epithelial tissues.

MOTIVATIONA major bottleneck in developing neural networks for cell segmentation is the need for labor-intensive manual curation in order to develop a training dataset. The present work addresses this limitation by developing an automated image analysis pipeline that utilizes small datasets to generate accurate labels of cells in complex, 3D epithelial contexts. The overall goal is to provide an automatic and feasible method to achieve high-quality epithelial reconstructions and to enable high-content analysis of morphological features, which can improve our understanding of how these tissues self-organize.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) at the crypt base divide and give rise to progenitor cells that have the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into various mature epithelial cell types in the transit-amplifying (TA) zone. Here, we identified the transcription factor ARID3A as a novel regulator of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation at the TA compartment. We show that ARID3A forms an expression gradient from villus tip to the early progenitors at the crypts mediated by TGF-{beta} and WNT signalling. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of Arid3a reduces proliferation of TA cells. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic analysis shows increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced secretory cells in the Arid3a cKO intestine. Interestingly, upper-villus gene signatures of both enterocytes and secretory cells are enriched in the mutant intestine. We find that the enhanced enterocyte differentiation in the Arid3a cKO intestine is caused by increased binding of HNF1 and HNF4. Finally, we show that loss of Arid3a impairs irradiation-induced regenerative process by altering the dynamics of proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings imply that ARID3A may play a gatekeeping role in the TA compartment to maintain the &#34;just-right&#34; proliferation-to-differentiation ratio for tissue homeostasis and plasticity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The morphogenesis of the pupal wing of Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model for understanding the physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis. During this process, the wing undergoes a dramatic reshaping where the hinge region contracts and pulls on the blade region, triggering a dynamic pattern of cell elongation changes, cell divisions, and cell neighborhood changes Etournay et al. (2015). Over our several year study of this process, we noticed that sometime after the year 2016, the onset of morphogenesis became consistently delayed by [~]6 h compared to previous years. Thus, the peak of cell elongation was now observed at 28 hours after puparium formation (hAPF) rather than at 20-22 hAPF. We show here that this delay is independent of genetic background and that the speed of the overall process is relatively unchanged, implying that an environmental factor causes a shift in the onset of the process relative to the start of pupariation. We then investigated how various environmental factors influence the timing of pupal wing morphogenesis, using the dynamics of cell elongation as a proxy. We find that imaging conditions, temperature, diet, Wolbachia infection, and the light/dark cycle have relatively little effect. Preliminary data show that the spectra of light used to rear the flies affects cell elongation dynamics, although the delay was not completely reverted and more experiments are needed to know precisely how this variable affects morphogenesis. In sum, our work suggests the presence of a gate controlling the onset of pupal wing morphogenesis that is influenced by a specific, yet unclear, environmental factor. Once the gate is released, pupal wing morphogenesis occurs at a fairly constant rate, remarkably robust to many environmental variables.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Meiotic prophase progression is differently regulated in males and females. In males, pachytene transition during meiotic prophase is accompanied by robust alteration in gene expression. However, how gene expression is regulated differently to ensure meiotic prophase completion in males remains elusive. Herein, we identified HSF5 as a male germ cell-specific heat shock transcription factor (HSF) for meiotic prophase progression. Genetic analyses and single-cell RNA-sequencing demonstrated that HSF5 is essential for progression beyond the pachytene stage under non-stress conditions rather than heat stress. Chromatin binding analysis in vivo and DNA-binding assays in vitro suggested that HSF5 binds to promoters in a subset of genes associated with chromatin organization. HSF5 recognizes a DNA motif different from typical heat shock elements recognized by other canonical HSFs. This study suggests that HSF5 is an atypical HSF that enforces the gene expression program for pachytene transition during meiotic prophase in males.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In mammals, many retrotransposons are de-repressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, their functions in early development remain elusive largely due to the challenge to simultaneously manipulate thousands of retrotransposon insertions in embryos. Here, we employed epigenome editing to perturb the long terminal repeat (LTR) MT2_Mm, a well-known ZGA and totipotency marker that exists in [~]2667 insertions throughout the mouse genome. CRISPRi robustly repressed 2485 ([~] 93%) MT2_Mm insertions and 1090 ([~]55%) insertions of the closely related MT2C_Mm in 2-cell embryos. Remarkably, such perturbation caused down-regulation of hundreds of ZGA genes at the 2-cell stage and embryonic arrest mostly at the morula stage. Mechanistically, MT2_Mm/MT2C_Mm primarily served as alternative ZGA promoters activated by OBOX proteins. Thus, through unprecedented large-scale epigenome editing, we addressed to what extent MT2_Mm/MT2C_Mm regulates ZGA and preimplantation development. Our approach could be adapted to systematically perturb retrotransposons in other mammalian embryos as it doesnt require transgenic animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Developmental studies have revealed the importance of the transcription factor Hand2 in cardiac development. Hand2 promotes cardiac progenitor differentiation and epithelial maturation, while repressing other tissue types. The mechanisms underlying the promotion of cardiac fates are far better understood than those underlying the repression of alternative fates. Here, we assess Hand2-dependent changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling in cardiac progenitors of zebrafish embryos. Cell-type specific transcriptome analysis shows a dual function for Hand2 in activation of cardiac differentiation genes and repression of pronephric pathways. We identify functional cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility are increased in hand2 mutant cells. These regulatory elements associate with non-cardiac gene expression, and drive reporter gene expression in tissues associated with Hand2-repressed genes. We find that functional Hand2 is sufficient to reduce non-cardiac reporter expression in cardiac lineages. Taken together, our data support a model of Hand2-dependent coordination of transcriptional programs, not only through transcriptional activation of cardiac and epithelial maturation genes, but also through repressive chromatin remodeling at the DNA regulatory elements of non-cardiac genes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Actin is generally required for cell movement but must be brought under the control of distinct developmental systems to drive specific morphogenetic processes, such as convergent extension (CE)1. This evolutionarily conserved collective cell movement elongates the body axis of all vertebrates and is governed by the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling system 1,2. Here, we sought to understand the interplay of PCP and actin during Xenopus CE. Our data provide new insights into the organization and emergence of polarity in this network and reveal new roles for the actin organizing Septins 3, thereby shedding light on the mechanisms by which developmental signaling systems exploit the ubiquitous machinery of cells to drive morphogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of a series of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, formed during development following the migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into the primitive gut tube. Much work has been done to unravel the complex nature of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate processes that direct the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ENCCs. However, ENS development is a complex process and we still have much to learn regarding the signaling factors that regulate ENCC development. Here in zebrafish, through transcriptomic, in situ transcript expression, immunohistochemical analysis, and chemical attenuation, we identified a time-dependent role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in the maintenance of Phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers and/or time of differentiation of the progenitor pool. In support of our in silico transcriptomic analysis, we identified expression of a novel ENS ligand-encoding transcript, bmp5, within developmental regions of ENCCs. Through generation of a novel mutant bmp5wmr2, we identified a functional role for BMP5 in proper GI tract colonization, whereby phox2bb&#43; enteric progenitor numbers were reduced. Altogether, this work has identified time-dependent roles for BMP signaling and identification of a novel extrinsic factor, BMP5, that is necessary for proper formation of vertebrate ENS.</p>
