Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.\nHuman naive stem cell models reveal the role of FGF signalling in hypoblast specification in the human embryo\nAuthors: Dattani, A.; Simon, E. C.; Radley, A.; Heydari, T.; Taheriabkenar, Y.; Carlisle, F.; Lin, S.; Mill, J.; Zandstra, P. W.; Nichols, J.; Guo, G.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569161\nThe hypoblast is an essential extra-embryonic tissue set aside within the inner cell mass early in mammalian embryo development, in the blastocyst. Research with human embryos is challenging. Thus, stem cell models that reproduce hypoblast differentiation provide valuable alternatives. We show here that human naive PSC to hypoblast differentiation proceeds via reversion to a transitional ICM-like state, from which hypoblast emerges in concordance with the trajectory in human blastocysts. We identified a window when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is critical for hypoblast specification. Revisiting FGF signalling in human embryos revealed that inhibition in the early blastocyst suppresses hypoblast formation. In vitro, the induction of hypoblast is synergistically enhanced by limiting trophectoderm and epiblast fates. This finding revises previous reports and establishes a conservation in lineage specification between mouse and human. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of human naive PSC-based models in elucidating mechanistic features of early human embryogenesis\nHemodynamics regulate spatiotemporal artery muscularization in the developing circle of Willis\nAuthors: Cheng, S.; Xia, I. F.; Wanner, R.; Abello, J.; Stratman, A. N.; Nicoli, S.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569622\nBrain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb+ common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb+ progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb+ recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.\nIntegrated Molecular-Phenotypic Profiling Reveals Metabolic Control of Morphological Variation in Stembryos\nAuthors: Villaronga Luque, A.; Savill, R. G.; Lopez-Anguita, N.; Bolondi, A.; Garai, S.; Gassaloglu, S. I.; Poddar, A.; Bulut-Karslioglu, A.; Veenvliet, J. V.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569921\nMammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.\nGetting there in one piece: The Rac pathway prevents cell fragmentation in a nonprotrusively migrating leader cell during organogenesis\nAuthors: Singh, N.; Li, K. J.; Gordon, K. L.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569642\nThe C. elegans hermaphrodite distal tip cell (DTC) leads gonadogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in a C. elegans ortholog of the Rac1 GTPase (ced-10) and its GEF complex (ced-5/DOCK180, ced-2/CrkII, ced-12/ELMO) cause gonad migration defects related to directional sensing; we discovered an additional defect class of gonad bifurcation in these mutants. Using genetic approaches, tissue-specific and whole-body RNAi, and in vivo imaging of endogenously tagged proteins and marked cells, we find that loss of Rac1 or its regulators causes the DTC to fragment as it migrates. Both products of fragmentation--the now-smaller DTC and the membranous patch of cellular material--localize important stem cell niche signaling (LAG-2/DSL ligand) and migration (INA-1/integrin subunit alpha) factors to their membranes, but only one retains the DTC nucleus and therefore the ability to maintain gene expression over time. The enucleate patch can lead a bifurcating branch off the gonad arm that grows through germ cell proliferation. Germ cells in this branch differentiate as the patch loses LAG-2 expression. While the nucleus is surprisingly dispensable for aspects of leader cell function, it is required for stem cell niche activity long-term. Prior work found that Rac1-/-;Rac2-/- mouse erythrocytes fragment; in this context, our new findings support the conclusion that maintaining a cohesive but deformable cell is a conserved function of this important cytoskeletal regulator.\nArtificial environment impact: O2 concentration changes between IVM and IVF alter embryo production, metabolism, and epigenetic marks\nAuthors: Brunhara Cruz, J.; Miziara Nogueira, C.; Sangalli, J.

R.; Bridi, A.; Pinzon, J.; Bianchi Rodrigues Alves, M.; Fernanda Martins Hossepian de Lima, V.; Watanabe, Y.; Fernandes Bressan, F.; Vieira Meirelles, F.; Vilar Sampaio, R.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569089\nCreating an optimal in vitro cell culture environment requires careful simulation of all critical components, especially the gaseous atmosphere. Although it is well-documented that embryonic culture under low oxygen tension promotes embryonic development, little is known about the effect of changes in in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) on the epigenome. This study explores the role of oxygen tension variation in the early stages of in vitro production of bovine embryos and its impact on oxidative stress and epigenetic remodeling. We initially validated our system by scrutinizing the epigenetic effects on bovine fibroblasts. We observed that cell cultures under 20% O2 exhibited reduced H3K9me2 levels in early passages, which stabilized with prolonged cultivation and elevated gene expression of HIF2a and KDM5C. Our results reveal that oocytes maturing in 20% O2 environments have heightened levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), whereas blastocyst embryos maturing under reduced oxygen tension exhibit increased oxidative stress markers (NRF2, SOD1, SOD2), with upregulated transcripts observed in epigenetic remodelers (KDM5A, TET1). Elevated O2 levels in both IVM and IVF processes showcase improved embryo production. Maintaining consistent O2 levels at either 5% or 20% between IVM and IVF results in heightened GSH, reduced ROS, and increased levels of H3K9me2/3 in embryos. Finally, distinct DNA methylation patterns emerge, indicating higher levels in groups matured under low O2 tension and increased DNA hydroxymethylation in groups fertilized under low O2 tension. In conclusion, our comprehensive investigation underscores the critical role of oxygen concentration in shaping the epigenetic landscape during the early stages of in vitro culture. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing conditions in assisted reproductive technologies.\nThe cell cycle controls spindle architecture in Arabidopsis by modulating the augmin pathway\nAuthors: Motta, M. R.; Nedelec, F.; Woelken, E.; Saville, H.; Jacquerie, C.; Pastuglia, M.; Stolze, S. C.; Van De Slijke, E.; Chen, P.; Boettger, L.; Belcram, K.; Nakagami, H.; De Jaeger, G.; Bouchez, D.; Schnittger, A.\nScore: 27.9, Published: 2023-11-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567058\nTo ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.\nReduced fetal cerebral blood flow following prenatal drug exposure predicts perinatal mortality.\nAuthors: Rouzer, S. K.; Sreeram, A.; Miranda, R. C.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569643\nBackground: Children exposed prenatally to alcohol or cannabinoids individually can exhibit growth deficits and increased risk for adverse birth outcomes. However, these drugs are often co-consumed and their combined effects on early brain development are virtually unknown. The blood vessels of the fetal brain emerge and mature during the neurogenic period to support nutritional needs of the rapidly growing brain. Teratogenic exposure during this gestational window may therefore impair fetal cerebrovascular development. Objective: To determine whether prenatal polysubstance exposure confers additional risk for impaired fetal-directed blood flow and offspring viability compared to each drug individually. Study Design: We performed high resolution in vivo ultrasound imaging in C57Bl/6J pregnant mice. After pregnancy confirmation, dams (n=40) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: drug-free control, alcohol-exposed, cannabinoid-exposed or alcohol-and-cannabinoid-exposed. Drug exposure occurred daily between Gestational Days 12-15, equivalent to the transition between the first and second trimesters in humans. Dams first received an intraperitoneal injection of either cannabinoid agonist CP-55940 (750g/kg) or volume-equivalent vehicle. Then, dams were placed in vapor chambers for 30min of inhalation of either ethanol or room air. Dams underwent ultrasound imaging on three days of pregnancy: Gestational Day 11 (pre-exposure), Gestational Day 13.5 (peri-exposure) and Gestational Day (post-exposure), and were subsequently monitored for health and delivery outcomes. Results: Of all exposure groups, only dams co-exposed to both alcohol and cannabinoids experienced reduced gestational weight gain while undergoing drug treatments. These same co-exposed pregnant mice also demonstrated higher (+42mg/dL) blood ethanol concentrations than dams exposed to alcohol only. All drug exposures decreased fetal cranial blood flow 24-hours after the final exposure episode, though combined alcohol and cannabinoid reduced internal carotid artery blood flow relative to all other exposures. Umbilical artery metrics were not affected by drug exposure, indicating a specific vulnerability of fetal cranial circulation. Cannabinoid exposure significantly reduced cerebroplacental ratios, mirroring prior findings in marijuana-exposed human fetuses. Post-exposure cerebroplacental ratios significantly predicted subsequent perinatal mortality (p=0.019, area under the curve, 0.772; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 85.70%) and retroactively diagnosed prior drug exposure (p=0.005; AUC, 0.861; sensitivity, 86.40%; specificity, 66.7%). Conclusion(s): Fetal cerebrovasculature is significantly impaired by exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids, and co-exposure confers additional risk for adverse birth outcomes. Considering the rising potency and global availability of cannabis products, there is an imperative for research to explore translational models of prenatal drug exposure, including polysubstance models, to inform appropriate strategies for treatment and care in pregnancies affected by drug exposure.\nTradeoff Between Speed and Robustness in Primordium Initiation Mediated by Auxin-CUC1 Interaction\nAuthors: Kong, S.; Zhu, M.; Pan, D.; Lane, B.; Smith, R. S.; Roeder, A. H. K.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569401\nRobustness is the reproducible development of a phenotype despite stochastic noise. It often involves tradeoffs with other performance metrics, but the mechanisms underlying such tradeoffs were largely unknown. An Arabidopsis flower robustly develops four sepals from four precisely positioned auxin maxima. The development related myb-like 1 (drmy1) mutant generates stochastic noise in auxin signaling that disrupts both the robust position and number of sepal primordia. Here, we found that increased expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), a boundary specification transcription factor, in the drmy1 mutant underlies this loss of robustness. CUC1 surrounds and amplifies stochastic auxin patches in drmy1 to form variably positioned auxin maxima and sepal primordia. Removing CUC1 from drmy1 provides time for the noise in auxin signaling to resolve into four precisely positioned auxin maxima, restoring robust sepal initiation. However, removing CUC1 decreases auxin maxima intensity and slows down sepal initiation. Thus, CUC1 increases morphogenesis speed but impairs robustness against auxin noise. Further, using a computational model, we found that the observed phenotype can be explained by the effect of CUC1 in repolarizing PIN FORMED1 (PIN1), a polar auxin transporter. Thus, our study illustrates a tradeoff between speed and robustness during development.\nSingle nucleus transcriptome of a \"Super RV\" shows increased insulin and angiogenesis signaling\nAuthors: Turaga, D.; Li, X.; Zhao, Y.; Tsai, C.-R.; Moreira, A.; Hickey, E.; Adachi, I.; Martin, J. F.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569092\nThe right ventricle (RV) is one of the four pumping chambers of the heart, pumping blood to the lungs. In severe forms of congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, the RV is made to pump into the systemic circulation. Such systemic RVs typically display early failure due to pressure overload. In rare cases a systemic RV persists into later decades of life - colloquially called a Super RV. Here we present the single-nucleus transcriptome of a systemic RV from a 60-year-old with congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (ccTGA). Our data shows two specific signaling pathways enriched in the ccTGA RV myocardium. First, we show increased insulin like growth factor (IGF1) signaling within the systemic RV myocardium: there is increased expression of the main receptor IGFR1 within the cardiomyocytes, and IGF1 ligands within the cardiofibroblasts and macrophages. Second, we find increased VEGF and Wnt9 ligand expression in cardiomyocytes and increased VEGF1R and Wnt9 receptors in endothelial cells, which are implicated in angiogenesis. We show that increased insulin and angiogenesis signaling are potentially beneficial RV adaptations to increased pressure overload. This study of an adult systemic RV provides an important framework for understanding RV remodeling to systemic pressures in congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.\n",

        <p class="abstract">During embryonic development, cells exit pluripotency to give rise to the three germ layers. Metabolic pathways influence cell fate decisions by modulating the epigenetic, transcriptional, and signalling states of cells. However, the interplay between metabolism and the major signalling pathways that drive the emergence of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an instructive role of glycolytic activity in activating signalling pathways involved in mesoderm and endoderm induction. Using an in vitro model system for mouse gastrulation, we observed that inhibiting glycolysis prevents the upregulation of primitive streak markers, resulting in a significant increase in ectodermal cell fates at the expense of mesodermal and endodermal lineages. We demonstrate that this relationship is dose-dependent, enabling metabolic control of germ layer proportions through exogenous glucose levels. Mechanistically, we found that glycolysis inhibition leads to the downregulation of Wnt, Nodal, and Fgf signalling. Notably, this metabolic phenotype was rescued by Nodal or Wnt signalling agonists in the absence of glycolytic activity, suggesting that glycolytic activity acts upstream of both signalling pathways. Our work underscores the dependence of specific signalling pathways on metabolic conditions and provides mechanistic insight into the nutritional regulation of cell fate decision making.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The hypoblast is an essential extra-embryonic tissue set aside within the inner cell mass early in mammalian embryo development, in the blastocyst. Research with human embryos is challenging. Thus, stem cell models that reproduce hypoblast differentiation provide valuable alternatives. We show here that human naive PSC to hypoblast differentiation proceeds via reversion to a transitional ICM-like state, from which hypoblast emerges in concordance with the trajectory in human blastocysts. We identified a window when fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is critical for hypoblast specification. Revisiting FGF signalling in human embryos revealed that inhibition in the early blastocyst suppresses hypoblast formation. In vitro, the induction of hypoblast is synergistically enhanced by limiting trophectoderm and epiblast fates. This finding revises previous reports and establishes a conservation in lineage specification between mouse and human. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of human naive PSC-based models in elucidating mechanistic features of early human embryogenesis</p>

        <p class="abstract">Brain arteries are wrapped by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Fully differentiated VSMCs are important for brain artery homeostasis, and they are lost in several cerebrovascular diseases. How healthy VSMCs differentiate on different brain arteries during development is unclear. Such knowledge will help regenerate lost VSMCs in brain arteriopathy. To answer this question, we studied the developmental muscularization of the zebrafish circle of Willis (CW) arteries, the major arterial loop that supplies blood to the brain in all vertebrates. We found that artery specification of CW endothelial cells (ECs) happens after they migrate from primitive veins to form CW arteries. VSMCs differentiate from pdgfrb&#43; common vascular mural cell progenitors at the time when embryo circulation starts and progress temporally and spatially from anterior to posterior CW arteries. Computational fluid dynamic simulation confirms that earlier VSMC differentiation coincide with higher pulsatile flow hemodynamics in anterior CW arteries. Pulsatile blood flow induces the differentiation of human brain pdgfrb&#43; progenitors into VSMCs and reducing pulsatile blood flow by blocking the zebrafish embryo heartbeat after pdgfrb&#43; recruitment but before VSMC differentiation limits the number of mature VSMCs. Congruently, the flow responsive transcription factor klf2a is activated in ECs before VSMC differentiation and knockdown delays VSMC differentiation on CW arteries. Overall, our data place hemodynamic activation of endothelial klf2a signaling as key determinant of spatiotemporal VSMC differentiation on CW arteries.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian stem-cell-based models of embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states and morphological history of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling, we identify early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. Leveraging this predictive power revealed that early imbalance of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis results in aberrant morphology and a neural lineage bias that can be corrected by metabolic interventions. Collectively, our work establishes divergent metabolic states as drivers of phenotypic variation, and offers a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems. The strategy can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes, ultimately increasing the reproducibility of in vitro systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The C. elegans hermaphrodite distal tip cell (DTC) leads gonadogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in a C. elegans ortholog of the Rac1 GTPase (ced-10) and its GEF complex (ced-5/DOCK180, ced-2/CrkII, ced-12/ELMO) cause gonad migration defects related to directional sensing; we discovered an additional defect class of gonad bifurcation in these mutants. Using genetic approaches, tissue-specific and whole-body RNAi, and in vivo imaging of endogenously tagged proteins and marked cells, we find that loss of Rac1 or its regulators causes the DTC to fragment as it migrates. Both products of fragmentation--the now-smaller DTC and the membranous patch of cellular material--localize important stem cell niche signaling (LAG-2/DSL ligand) and migration (INA-1/integrin subunit alpha) factors to their membranes, but only one retains the DTC nucleus and therefore the ability to maintain gene expression over time. The enucleate patch can lead a bifurcating branch off the gonad arm that grows through germ cell proliferation. Germ cells in this branch differentiate as the patch loses LAG-2 expression. While the nucleus is surprisingly dispensable for aspects of leader cell function, it is required for stem cell niche activity long-term. Prior work found that Rac1-/-;Rac2-/- mouse erythrocytes fragment; in this context, our new findings support the conclusion that maintaining a cohesive but deformable cell is a conserved function of this important cytoskeletal regulator.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Creating an optimal in vitro cell culture environment requires careful simulation of all critical components, especially the gaseous atmosphere. Although it is well-documented that embryonic culture under low oxygen tension promotes embryonic development, little is known about the effect of changes in in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) on the epigenome. This study explores the role of oxygen tension variation in the early stages of in vitro production of bovine embryos and its impact on oxidative stress and epigenetic remodeling. We initially validated our system by scrutinizing the epigenetic effects on bovine fibroblasts. We observed that cell cultures under 20% O2 exhibited reduced H3K9me2 levels in early passages, which stabilized with prolonged cultivation and elevated gene expression of HIF2a and KDM5C. Our results reveal that oocytes maturing in 20% O2 environments have heightened levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), whereas blastocyst embryos maturing under reduced oxygen tension exhibit increased oxidative stress markers (NRF2, SOD1, SOD2), with upregulated transcripts observed in epigenetic remodelers (KDM5A, TET1). Elevated O2 levels in both IVM and IVF processes showcase improved embryo production. Maintaining consistent O2 levels at either 5% or 20% between IVM and IVF results in heightened GSH, reduced ROS, and increased levels of H3K9me2/3 in embryos. Finally, distinct DNA methylation patterns emerge, indicating higher levels in groups matured under low O2 tension and increased DNA hydroxymethylation in groups fertilized under low O2 tension. In conclusion, our comprehensive investigation underscores the critical role of oxygen concentration in shaping the epigenetic landscape during the early stages of in vitro culture. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing conditions in assisted reproductive technologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">To ensure an even segregation of chromosomes during somatic cell division, eukaryotes rely on specific microtubule structures called mitotic spindles. There are, however, striking differences in overall spindle organization among eukaryotic super groups, and in particular little is known about how spindle architecture is determined in plants. As a foundation for our work, we have measured prime characteristics of Arabidopsis mitotic spindles and built a three-dimensional dynamic model of the Arabidopsis mitotic spindle using Cytosim. Next, we identified the cell-cycle regulator CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE B1 (CDKB1) together with its cyclin partner CYCB3;1 as key regulators of spindle shape and organization in Arabidopsis. Loss of CDKB1 function resulted in a high number of astral microtubules that are normally absent from plant spindles, as opposed to animal ones. We identified an augmin complex member, ENDOSPERM DEFECTIVE1 (EDE1), as a substrate of the CDKB1;1-CYCB3;1 complex. A non-phosphorylatable mutant of EDE1 displayed spindles with extended pole-to-pole distance, resembling the phenotypes of cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Moreover, we found that the mutated EDE1 version associated less efficiently with spindle microtubules. Consistently, reducing the level of augmin in Cytosim simulations largely recapitulated the spindle phenotypes observed in cycb3;1 and cdkb1 mutants. Our results emphasize the importance of cell cycle-dependent phospho-control of the mitotic spindle in plant cells. They also support the validity of our computational model as a framework for the exploration of mechanisms controlling the organization of the spindle in plants and in other species.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Children exposed prenatally to alcohol or cannabinoids individually can exhibit growth deficits and increased risk for adverse birth outcomes. However, these drugs are often co-consumed and their combined effects on early brain development are virtually unknown. The blood vessels of the fetal brain emerge and mature during the neurogenic period to support nutritional needs of the rapidly growing brain. Teratogenic exposure during this gestational window may therefore impair fetal cerebrovascular development. Objective: To determine whether prenatal polysubstance exposure confers additional risk for impaired fetal-directed blood flow and offspring viability compared to each drug individually. Study Design: We performed high resolution in vivo ultrasound imaging in C57Bl/6J pregnant mice. After pregnancy confirmation, dams (n=40) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: drug-free control, alcohol-exposed, cannabinoid-exposed or alcohol-and-cannabinoid-exposed. Drug exposure occurred daily between Gestational Days 12-15, equivalent to the transition between the first and second trimesters in humans. Dams first received an intraperitoneal injection of either cannabinoid agonist CP-55940 (750g/kg) or volume-equivalent vehicle. Then, dams were placed in vapor chambers for 30min of inhalation of either ethanol or room air. Dams underwent ultrasound imaging on three days of pregnancy: Gestational Day 11 (pre-exposure), Gestational Day 13.5 (peri-exposure) and Gestational Day (post-exposure), and were subsequently monitored for health and delivery outcomes. Results: Of all exposure groups, only dams co-exposed to both alcohol and cannabinoids experienced reduced gestational weight gain while undergoing drug treatments. These same co-exposed pregnant mice also demonstrated higher (&#43;42mg/dL) blood ethanol concentrations than dams exposed to alcohol only. All drug exposures decreased fetal cranial blood flow 24-hours after the final exposure episode, though combined alcohol and cannabinoid reduced internal carotid artery blood flow relative to all other exposures. Umbilical artery metrics were not affected by drug exposure, indicating a specific vulnerability of fetal cranial circulation. Cannabinoid exposure significantly reduced cerebroplacental ratios, mirroring prior findings in marijuana-exposed human fetuses. Post-exposure cerebroplacental ratios significantly predicted subsequent perinatal mortality (p=0.019, area under the curve, 0.772; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 85.70%) and retroactively diagnosed prior drug exposure (p=0.005; AUC, 0.861; sensitivity, 86.40%; specificity, 66.7%). Conclusion(s): Fetal cerebrovasculature is significantly impaired by exposure to alcohol or cannabinoids, and co-exposure confers additional risk for adverse birth outcomes. Considering the rising potency and global availability of cannabis products, there is an imperative for research to explore translational models of prenatal drug exposure, including polysubstance models, to inform appropriate strategies for treatment and care in pregnancies affected by drug exposure.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Robustness is the reproducible development of a phenotype despite stochastic noise. It often involves tradeoffs with other performance metrics, but the mechanisms underlying such tradeoffs were largely unknown. An Arabidopsis flower robustly develops four sepals from four precisely positioned auxin maxima. The development related myb-like 1 (drmy1) mutant generates stochastic noise in auxin signaling that disrupts both the robust position and number of sepal primordia. Here, we found that increased expression of CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), a boundary specification transcription factor, in the drmy1 mutant underlies this loss of robustness. CUC1 surrounds and amplifies stochastic auxin patches in drmy1 to form variably positioned auxin maxima and sepal primordia. Removing CUC1 from drmy1 provides time for the noise in auxin signaling to resolve into four precisely positioned auxin maxima, restoring robust sepal initiation. However, removing CUC1 decreases auxin maxima intensity and slows down sepal initiation. Thus, CUC1 increases morphogenesis speed but impairs robustness against auxin noise. Further, using a computational model, we found that the observed phenotype can be explained by the effect of CUC1 in repolarizing PIN FORMED1 (PIN1), a polar auxin transporter. Thus, our study illustrates a tradeoff between speed and robustness during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The right ventricle (RV) is one of the four pumping chambers of the heart, pumping blood to the lungs. In severe forms of congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, the RV is made to pump into the systemic circulation. Such systemic RVs typically display early failure due to pressure overload. In rare cases a systemic RV persists into later decades of life - colloquially called a  Super RV. Here we present the single-nucleus transcriptome of a systemic RV from a 60-year-old with congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries (ccTGA). Our data shows two specific signaling pathways enriched in the ccTGA RV myocardium. First, we show increased insulin like growth factor (IGF1) signaling within the systemic RV myocardium: there is increased expression of the main receptor IGFR1 within the cardiomyocytes, and IGF1 ligands within the cardiofibroblasts and macrophages. Second, we find increased VEGF and Wnt9 ligand expression in cardiomyocytes and increased VEGF1R and Wnt9 receptors in endothelial cells, which are implicated in angiogenesis. We show that increased insulin and angiogenesis signaling are potentially beneficial RV adaptations to increased pressure overload. This study of an adult systemic RV provides an important framework for understanding RV remodeling to systemic pressures in congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
