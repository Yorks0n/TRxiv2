J.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553366\nCell proliferation underlying tissue growth and homeostasis, requires high levels of metabolites such as deoxynucleotides (dNTPs). The dNTP pool is known to be tightly cell-autonomously regulated through the de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. Here, we reveal that nucleotides can be provided to cells non-autonomously by surrounding cells of the tissue. Drosophila adult intestinal stem cells are highly sensitive to nucleotide depletion whereas wing progenitor cells are not. While adult intestinal stem cells lack gap junctions and their associated capacity to buffer dNTP pools, wing progenitor cells share nucleotides through connections to surrounding cells via gap junctions, allowing buffering of replication stress induced by nucleotide pool depletion. These findings have broad implications, suggesting that gap junction connectivity may define how sensitive cells are to changes in intracellular dNTP levels and replication stress.\nReversal of Biological Age in Multiple Rat Organs by Young Porcine Plasma Fraction\nAuthors: Horvath, S.; Singh, K.; Raj, K.; Khairnar, S.; Sanghavi, A.; Shrivastava, A.; Zoller, J. A.; Li, C. Z.; Herenu, C. B.; Canatelli-Mallat, M.; Lehmann, M.; Habazin, S.; Vuckovic, F.; Solberg-Woods, L.; Garcia Martinez, A.; Wang, T.; Chiavellini, P.; Levine, A. J.; Chen, H.; Brooke, R. T.; Gordevicius, J.; Lauc, G.; Goya, R. G.; Katcher, H. L.\nScore: 36.6, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552148\nYoung blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.\nGlobal decoupling of cell differentiation from cell division in early embryo development\nAuthors: Kukreja, K.; Patel, N.; Megason, S. G.; Klein, A. M.\nScore: 51.7, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551123\nAs tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.\nSingle-cell transcriptome landscape of developing fetal gonads defines somatic cell lineage specification in humans\nAuthors: Lardenois, A.; Suglia, A.; Moore, C.

D.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-08-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552336\nGonad development is an exciting model to study cell fate commitment. However, the specification and differentiation of somatic cell lineages within the testis and the ovary are incompletely characterized, especially in humans. In fact, a better understanding of sex determination first requires the identification of all the cell types involved and of their dynamic expression programs. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of approximately 128,000 single cells collected from 33 fetal testes and ovaries between 5 and 12 postconceptional weeks. In particular, a focused analysis of somatic cells allowed us to identify a common population of bipotential progenitors derived from the coelomic epithelium of both male and female gonads and capable of committing to either a steroidogenic or a supporting fate. Moreover, we have shown that early supporting cells, prior to further differentiation into Sertoli or granulosa cells, also give rise to the rete testis/ovarii lineage. Finally, we found that the ovary retains the capacity to feed the supporting cell pool for an extended period of time, directly from the surface epithelial cells and, bypassing the bipotential progenitor step. Altogether, our results provide an unprecedented revisiting of the human gonadal sex determination process.\nPRDM16 co-operates with LHX2 to shape the human brain\nAuthors: Suresh, V.; Bhattacharya, B.; Tshuva, R. Y.; Danan Gotthold, M.; Olender, T.; Bose, M.; Ben Zeev, B.; Smith, R. S.; Pradhan, S. J.; Tole, S.; Galande, S.; Harwell, C.; Baizabal, M.; Reiner, O.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553065\nPRDM16 is a dynamic transcriptional regulator of various stem cell niches, including adipocytic, hematopoietic, cardiac progenitors, and neural stem cells. PRDM16 has been suggested to contribute to 1p36 deletion syndrome, one of the most prevalent subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes. We report a patient with a de novo nonsense mutation in the PRDM16 coding sequence, accompanied by lissencephaly and microcephaly features. Human stem cells were genetically modified to mimic this mutation, generating cortical organoids that exhibited altered cell cycle dynamics. RNA sequencing of cortical organoids at day 32 unveiled changes in cell adhesion and WNT-signaling pathways. ChIP-seq of PRDM16 identified binding sites in postmortem human fetal cortex, indicating the conservation of PRDM16 binding to developmental genes in mice and humans, potentially at enhancer sites. A shared motif between PRDM16 and LHX2 was identified and further examined through comparison with LHX2 ChIP-seq data from mice. These results suggested a collaborative partnership between PRDM16 and LHX2 in regulating a common set of genes and pathways in cortical radial glia cells, possibly via their synergistic involvement in cortical development.\nThe longitudinal single-cell panorama of cynomolgus monkey ovary throughout lifespan revealed a conserved ovarian clock between primates\nAuthors: Yan, L.; Long, X.; Zhao, Y.; Zhao, F.; Tu, W.; Yang, Q.; Qian, J.; Zhai, J.; Wang, M.; Hu, Y.; He, B.; Su, Y.; Jiang, X.; Gao, F.; Wang, H.; Guo, F.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553309\nOvarian function is critical for female fertility and impacts reproductive longevity. It is of great importance to accurately predict the aging process within the ovary for fertility assessment and disease diagnosis. However, cell metrics for evaluating the ovarian aging rate are still in urgent need, and molecular insights into ovarian development and dysfunction during the primate life course are also limited. Here, we reported large-scale ovarian cell atlas of consecutive development of cynomolgus monkeys across 22 years with 20 time points, covering the foetal, newborn, prepubertal, pubertal, adult, perimenopausal and menopausal stages. We characterized and validated distinct molecular signatures of each cluster of cells within primate ovaries, and uncovered a previously undocumented RHOXF1-positive oocyte type during primordial follicle assembly in primates. Furthermore, the constitution and developmental trajectories of primate germ cells, granulosa cells and stromal / theca cells were also elucidated, and their precursors were identified. More importantly, dynamics of cellular compositions were unravelled through the ovarian development, featured by granulosa, epithelial, stromal, and immune cells that showed strong temporal heterogeneity spanning lifetime, whilst referred to the key function during the corresponding stages. Based on the correlations of each cell type with age and stage-specific molecular dynamics, we further constructed a transcriptomic ovarian clock which could perceive an effective biological age prediction of the ovary and further applied to humans. The findings reveal granulosa, epithelial, and stromal cells as the highest performance predictors of ovarian biological age, while highlighting the crucial role of AGE-RAGE and Relaxin signaling pathways in regulating ovarian aging. Our work not only provide valuable resource for obtaining insights into the development, aging and dysfunction of key organs, but also establish a transcriptomic clock to predict biological ovarian aging thus to be potential clinical implementation in future.\nSIN-3 transcriptional coregulator maintains mitochondrial hormesis and polyamine flux\nAuthors: Palladino, F.; Giovannetti, M.; Fabrizio, P.; Nicolle, O.; Bedet, C.; Rodriguez-Palero, M.; Michaux, G.; Artal-Sanz, M.; Witting, M.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.07.552272\nMitochondrial function relies on the coordinated transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to assemble respiratory chain complexes. Across species, the SIN3 coregulator influences mitochondrial functions, but how its loss impacts mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism in the context of a whole organism is unknown. Exploring this link is important because SIN3 haploinsufficiency causes intellectual disability/autism syndromes and SIN3 plays an important role in tumor biology. Here we show that loss of C. elegans SIN-3 results in transcriptional deregulation of mitochondrial- and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, potentially leading to mito-nuclear imbalance. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial function, sin-3 mutants show extensive mitochondrial fragmentation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo imaging, and altered oxygen consumption. Metabolomic analysis of sin-3 mutant animals identifies a signature of mitochondria stress, and deregulation of methionine flux resulting in decreased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and increased polyamine levels. Our results identify SIN3 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic flux, with important implications for human pathologies.\nPiezo regulates epithelial topology and promotes precision in organ size control\nAuthors: Kumar, N.; Mim, M. S.; Levis, M.; Unger, M.; Miranda, G.; Robinett, T.; Zartman, J. J.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.553584\nMechanosensitive Piezo channels regulate cell division through calcium-mediated activation of ERK signaling or activate Rho signaling to mediate cell extrusion and cell death. However, systems-level functions of Piezo in regulating organogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Piezo controls epithelial cell topology to ensure precise organ growth through the integration of live imaging experiments with pharmacological and genetic perturbations and computational modeling. Notably, knockout or knockdown of Piezo led to bilateral asymmetry in wing phenotypes. While pharmacological activation of Piezo stimulated an increase in the frequency of spikes in cytosolic Ca2+, we discovered that Piezo overexpression counterintuitively reduces Ca2+ signaling dynamics. Knockdown of Piezo inhibited proliferation and decreased apoptosis, resulting in an overall increase in epithelial overcrowding. In contrast, either genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of Piezo increased cell proliferation and cell removal through basal extrusion. Surprisingly, Piezo overexpression increased the hexagonality of cellular topology. To test whether Piezo regulates cell topology, we formulated computational simulations to investigate how expression levels of Piezo protein regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis through modulation of the cut-off tension required for Piezo channel activation. Quantitative analysis validated computational simulation predictions of how perturbations to Piezo impacted epithelial topology. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Piezo promotes robustness in regulating epithelial topology and is necessary for precise organ size control.\nSphingolipid metabolism is spatially regulated in the developing embryo by SOXE genes\nAuthors: Piacentino, M. L.; Fasse, A. J.; Camacho-Avila, A.; Grabylnikov, I.; Bronner, M. E.\nScore: 8.2, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552770\nDuring epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), significant rearrangements occur in plasma membrane protein and lipid content that are important for membrane function and acquisition of cell motility. To gain insight into how neural crest cells regulate their lipid content at the transcriptional level during EMT, here we identify critical enhancer sequences that regulate the expression of SMPD3, a gene responsible for sphingomyelin hydrolysis to produce ceramide, which is necessary for neural crest EMT. We uncovered three enhancer regions within the first intron of the SMPD3 locus that drive reporter expression in distinct spatial and temporal domains, together collectively recapitulating the expression domains of endogenous SMPD3 within the ectodermal lineages. We further dissected one enhancer that is specifically active in the migrating neural crest. By mutating putative transcriptional input sites or knocking down upstream regulators, we find that the SoxE-family transcription factors Sox9 and Sox10 regulate the expression of SMPD3 in migrating neural crest cells. Together these results shed light on how core components of developmental gene regulatory networks interact with metabolic effector genes to control changes in membrane lipid content. HighlightsO_LISMPD3 is expressed in the neural tube, neural crest, and notochord during early development C_LIO_LISMPD3 expression is regulated by at least three intronic enhancers C_LIO_LISox10 and its binding sites are required for expression by a migratory neural crest-specific SMPD3 enhancer C_LIO_LISox10 is a positive regulator of endogenous SMPD3 expression during neural crest migration C_LI\nLymphatic vessel development in human embryos\nAuthors: Yamaguchi, S.; Minamide, N.; Imai, H.; Ikeda, T.; Watanabe, M.; Imanaka-Yoshida, K.; Maruyama, K.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.12.553102\nLymphatic vessel development has been a subject of research for about 120 years. Studies employing mice and zebrafish models have elucidated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) predominantly differentiate from venous endothelial cells via the expression of transcription factor Prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1), a master regulator of lymphatic vessel development. On the other hand, it has been found that LECs can also be generated from undifferentiated mesodermal or hemogenic endothelial cells, suggesting potential diversity in their origins depending on the organ or anatomical location. However, knowledge of human lymphatic vessel development remains limited. Here, we examined early lymphatic development in humans by analyzing 31 embryos and three 9-week old fetuses. We found that human embryos produce Prox1-expressing LECs in and around the cardinal veins, which converged to form initial lymph sacs. Furthermore, we also examined lymphatic vessel development in the heart, lungs, lower jaw, mesentery, intestines and kidneys. Lymphatic vessels appeared to develop at different rates in each organ and to display temporal differences in marker expression. These observation showed the possibility that there could exist different patterns of lymphatic vessel development across organs, which may reflect different cellular origins or developmental signaling in each organ. Our study elucidates early human lymphatic vessel development, which facilitates understanding of lymphatic vessel evolution and phylogenetics, and also leads to illuminate the etiology of congenital lymph-related diseases, such as lymphatic malformations. Significance StatementLymphatic vessel development has been a focus of research for over a century. Recent studies across a variety of species have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells originate from embryonic veins, and undifferentiated mesodermal cells. However, whether these findings are applicable to human has yet to be determined. In this study, we explored lymphatic vessel development in humans. Our analysis demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells in human embryos initially derived from embryonic veins. Notably, we found that lymphatic vessels in different organs displayed distinct developmental and marker expression patterns, suggesting a diversity in lymphatic vessel development across organs. Our research revealed the human lymphatic vessel development, contributing to the understanding of phylogenetics of lymphatic vessels and lymph-related diseases.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cell proliferation underlying tissue growth and homeostasis, requires high levels of metabolites such as deoxynucleotides (dNTPs). The dNTP pool is known to be tightly cell-autonomously regulated through the de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. Here, we reveal that nucleotides can be provided to cells non-autonomously by surrounding cells of the tissue. Drosophila adult intestinal stem cells are highly sensitive to nucleotide depletion whereas wing progenitor cells are not. While adult intestinal stem cells lack gap junctions and their associated capacity to buffer dNTP pools, wing progenitor cells share nucleotides through connections to surrounding cells via gap junctions, allowing buffering of replication stress induced by nucleotide pool depletion. These findings have broad implications, suggesting that gap junction connectivity may define how sensitive cells are to changes in intracellular dNTP levels and replication stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Young blood plasma is known to confer beneficial effects on various organs in mice and rats. However, it was not known whether plasma from young pigs rejuvenates old rat tissues at the epigenetic level; whether it alters the epigenetic clock, which is a highly accurate molecular biomarker of aging. To address this question, we developed and validated six different epigenetic clocks for rat tissues that are based on DNA methylation values derived from n=613 tissue samples. As indicated by their respective names, the rat pan-tissue clock can be applied to DNA methylation profiles from all rat tissues, while the rat brain-, liver-, and blood clocks apply to the corresponding tissue types. We also developed two epigenetic clocks that apply to both human and rat tissues by adding n=1366 human tissue samples to the training data. We employed these six rat clocks to investigate the rejuvenation effects of a porcine plasma fraction treatment in different rat tissues. The treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue. A less pronounced, but statistically significant, rejuvenation effect could be observed in the hypothalamus. The treatment was accompanied by progressive improvement in the function of these organs as ascertained through numerous biochemical/physiological biomarkers and behavioral responses to assess cognitive functions. An immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation pattern shift from pro-to anti-inflammatory also indicated reversal of glycan aging. Overall, this study demonstrates that a young porcine plasma-derived treatment markedly reverses aging in rats according to epigenetic clocks, IgG glycans, and other biomarkers of aging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">As tissues develop, cells divide and differentiate concurrently. Conflicting evidence shows that cell division is either dispensable or required for formation of cell types. To determine the role of cell division in differentiation, we arrested the cell cycle in zebrafish embryos using two independent approaches and profiled them at single-cell resolution. We show that cell division is dispensable for differentiation of all embryonic tissues during initial cell type differentiation from early gastrulation to the end of segmentation. In the absence of cell division, differentiation slows down in some cell types, and cells exhibit global stress responses. While differentiation is robust to blocking cell division, the proportions of cells across cell states are not. This work simplifies our understanding of the role of cell division in development and showcases the utility of combining embryo-wide perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover the role of common biological processes across multiple tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gonad development is an exciting model to study cell fate commitment. However, the specification and differentiation of somatic cell lineages within the testis and the ovary are incompletely characterized, especially in humans. In fact, a better understanding of sex determination first requires the identification of all the cell types involved and of their dynamic expression programs. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of approximately 128,000 single cells collected from 33 fetal testes and ovaries between 5 and 12 postconceptional weeks. In particular, a focused analysis of somatic cells allowed us to identify a common population of bipotential progenitors derived from the coelomic epithelium of both male and female gonads and capable of committing to either a steroidogenic or a supporting fate. Moreover, we have shown that early supporting cells, prior to further differentiation into Sertoli or granulosa cells, also give rise to the rete testis/ovarii lineage. Finally, we found that the ovary retains the capacity to feed the supporting cell pool for an extended period of time, directly from the surface epithelial cells and, bypassing the bipotential progenitor step. Altogether, our results provide an unprecedented revisiting of the human gonadal sex determination process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PRDM16 is a dynamic transcriptional regulator of various stem cell niches, including adipocytic, hematopoietic, cardiac progenitors, and neural stem cells. PRDM16 has been suggested to contribute to 1p36 deletion syndrome, one of the most prevalent subtelomeric microdeletion syndromes. We report a patient with a de novo nonsense mutation in the PRDM16 coding sequence, accompanied by lissencephaly and microcephaly features. Human stem cells were genetically modified to mimic this mutation, generating cortical organoids that exhibited altered cell cycle dynamics. RNA sequencing of cortical organoids at day 32 unveiled changes in cell adhesion and WNT-signaling pathways. ChIP-seq of PRDM16 identified binding sites in postmortem human fetal cortex, indicating the conservation of PRDM16 binding to developmental genes in mice and humans, potentially at enhancer sites. A shared motif between PRDM16 and LHX2 was identified and further examined through comparison with LHX2 ChIP-seq data from mice. These results suggested a collaborative partnership between PRDM16 and LHX2 in regulating a common set of genes and pathways in cortical radial glia cells, possibly via their synergistic involvement in cortical development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ovarian function is critical for female fertility and impacts reproductive longevity. It is of great importance to accurately predict the aging process within the ovary for fertility assessment and disease diagnosis. However, cell metrics for evaluating the ovarian aging rate are still in urgent need, and molecular insights into ovarian development and dysfunction during the primate life course are also limited. Here, we reported large-scale ovarian cell atlas of consecutive development of cynomolgus monkeys across 22 years with 20 time points, covering the foetal, newborn, prepubertal, pubertal, adult, perimenopausal and menopausal stages. We characterized and validated distinct molecular signatures of each cluster of cells within primate ovaries, and uncovered a previously undocumented RHOXF1-positive oocyte type during primordial follicle assembly in primates. Furthermore, the constitution and developmental trajectories of primate germ cells, granulosa cells and stromal / theca cells were also elucidated, and their precursors were identified. More importantly, dynamics of cellular compositions were unravelled through the ovarian development, featured by granulosa, epithelial, stromal, and immune cells that showed strong temporal heterogeneity spanning lifetime, whilst referred to the key function during the corresponding stages. Based on the correlations of each cell type with age and stage-specific molecular dynamics, we further constructed a transcriptomic ovarian clock which could perceive an effective biological age prediction of the ovary and further applied to humans. The findings reveal granulosa, epithelial, and stromal cells as the highest performance predictors of ovarian biological age, while highlighting the crucial role of AGE-RAGE and Relaxin signaling pathways in regulating ovarian aging. Our work not only provide valuable resource for obtaining insights into the development, aging and dysfunction of key organs, but also establish a transcriptomic clock to predict biological ovarian aging thus to be potential clinical implementation in future.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to assemble respiratory chain complexes. Across species, the SIN3 coregulator influences mitochondrial functions, but how its loss impacts mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism in the context of a whole organism is unknown. Exploring this link is important because SIN3 haploinsufficiency causes intellectual disability/autism syndromes and SIN3 plays an important role in tumor biology. Here we show that loss of C. elegans SIN-3 results in transcriptional deregulation of mitochondrial- and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, potentially leading to mito-nuclear imbalance. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial function, sin-3 mutants show extensive mitochondrial fragmentation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo imaging, and altered oxygen consumption. Metabolomic analysis of sin-3 mutant animals identifies a signature of mitochondria stress, and deregulation of methionine flux resulting in decreased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and increased polyamine levels. Our results identify SIN3 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic flux, with important implications for human pathologies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanosensitive Piezo channels regulate cell division through calcium-mediated activation of ERK signaling or activate Rho signaling to mediate cell extrusion and cell death. However, systems-level functions of Piezo in regulating organogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Piezo controls epithelial cell topology to ensure precise organ growth through the integration of live imaging experiments with pharmacological and genetic perturbations and computational modeling. Notably, knockout or knockdown of Piezo led to bilateral asymmetry in wing phenotypes. While pharmacological activation of Piezo stimulated an increase in the frequency of spikes in cytosolic Ca2&#43;, we discovered that Piezo overexpression counterintuitively reduces Ca2&#43; signaling dynamics. Knockdown of Piezo inhibited proliferation and decreased apoptosis, resulting in an overall increase in epithelial overcrowding. In contrast, either genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of Piezo increased cell proliferation and cell removal through basal extrusion. Surprisingly, Piezo overexpression increased the hexagonality of cellular topology. To test whether Piezo regulates cell topology, we formulated computational simulations to investigate how expression levels of Piezo protein regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis through modulation of the cut-off tension required for Piezo channel activation. Quantitative analysis validated computational simulation predictions of how perturbations to Piezo impacted epithelial topology. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Piezo promotes robustness in regulating epithelial topology and is necessary for precise organ size control.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), significant rearrangements occur in plasma membrane protein and lipid content that are important for membrane function and acquisition of cell motility. To gain insight into how neural crest cells regulate their lipid content at the transcriptional level during EMT, here we identify critical enhancer sequences that regulate the expression of SMPD3, a gene responsible for sphingomyelin hydrolysis to produce ceramide, which is necessary for neural crest EMT. We uncovered three enhancer regions within the first intron of the SMPD3 locus that drive reporter expression in distinct spatial and temporal domains, together collectively recapitulating the expression domains of endogenous SMPD3 within the ectodermal lineages. We further dissected one enhancer that is specifically active in the migrating neural crest. By mutating putative transcriptional input sites or knocking down upstream regulators, we find that the SoxE-family transcription factors Sox9 and Sox10 regulate the expression of SMPD3 in migrating neural crest cells. Together these results shed light on how core components of developmental gene regulatory networks interact with metabolic effector genes to control changes in membrane lipid content.

HighlightsO_LISMPD3 is expressed in the neural tube, neural crest, and notochord during early development

        <p class="abstract">Lymphatic vessel development has been a subject of research for about 120 years. Studies employing mice and zebrafish models have elucidated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) predominantly differentiate from venous endothelial cells via the expression of transcription factor Prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1), a master regulator of lymphatic vessel development. On the other hand, it has been found that LECs can also be generated from undifferentiated mesodermal or hemogenic endothelial cells, suggesting potential diversity in their origins depending on the organ or anatomical location. However, knowledge of human lymphatic vessel development remains limited. Here, we examined early lymphatic development in humans by analyzing 31 embryos and three 9-week old fetuses. We found that human embryos produce Prox1-expressing LECs in and around the cardinal veins, which converged to form initial lymph sacs. Furthermore, we also examined lymphatic vessel development in the heart, lungs, lower jaw, mesentery, intestines and kidneys. Lymphatic vessels appeared to develop at different rates in each organ and to display temporal differences in marker expression. These observation showed the possibility that there could exist different patterns of lymphatic vessel development across organs, which may reflect different cellular origins or developmental signaling in each organ.

Our study elucidates early human lymphatic vessel development, which facilitates understanding of lymphatic vessel evolution and phylogenetics, and also leads to illuminate the etiology of congenital lymph-related diseases, such as lymphatic malformations.

Significance StatementLymphatic vessel development has been a focus of research for over a century. Recent studies across a variety of species have demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells originate from embryonic veins, and undifferentiated mesodermal cells. However, whether these findings are applicable to human has yet to be determined. In this study, we explored lymphatic vessel development in humans. Our analysis demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells in human embryos initially derived from embryonic veins. Notably, we found that lymphatic vessels in different organs displayed distinct developmental and marker expression patterns, suggesting a diversity in lymphatic vessel development across organs. Our research revealed the human lymphatic vessel development, contributing to the understanding of phylogenetics of lymphatic vessels and lymph-related diseases.</p>
