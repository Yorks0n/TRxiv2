Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.\nDevelopment and patterning of a highly versatile visual system in spiders\nAuthors: Baudouin Gonzalez, L.; Schoenauer, A.; Harper, A.; Arif, S.; Leite, D. J.; Steinhoff, P. O. M.; Pechmann, M.; Telizhenko, V.; Pande, A.; Kosiol, C.; McGregor, A. P.; Sumner-Rooney, L.\nScore: 20.0, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572789\nVisual systems provide a key interface between organisms and their surroundings, and have evolved in many forms to perform diverse functions across the animal kingdom. Spiders exhibit a range of visual abilities and ecologies, the diversity of which is underpinned by a highly versatile, modular visual system architecture. This typically includes eight eyes of two developmentally distinct types, but the number, size, location, and function of the eyes can vary dramatically between lineages. Previous studies of visual system development in spiders have confirmed that many components of the retinal determination gene (RDG) network are conserved in common with other arthropods, but so far, comparative studies among spiders are lacking. We characterised visual system development in eight species of spiders representing a range of morphologies, visual ecologies, and phylogenetic positions, to determine how these diverse configurations are formed, and how they might evolve. Combining synchrotron radiation tomography, transcriptomics, in situ hybridisation, and selection analyses, we describe the repertoires and expression of key RDGs in relation to adult morphology, and identify key molecular players, timepoints, and developmental events that may contribute to adult diversity. In particular, we discuss the molecular and developmental underpinnings of eye size, number, position, and identity across spiders, and highlight key areas for further functional analyses.\nSteroid signaling controls sex-specific development in an invertebrate\nAuthors: Grmai, L.; Jimenez, E.; Baxter, K.; Van Doren, M.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573099\nIn vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones -- testosterone and estrogen -- regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated downstream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.\nThe Developmental Transcription Factor TBX3 Physically Engages with the Wnt/β-catenin Transcriptional Complex in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells to Regulate Metastasis Genes\nAuthors: Jauregi-Miguel, A.; Soderholm, S.; Weiss, T. L.; Nordin, A.; Ghezzi, V.; Bruetsch, S. M.; Pagella, P.; van de Grift, Y.; Zambanini, G.; Ulisse, J.; Mattias, A.; Deviatiiarov, R.; Faustini, E.; Moparthi, L.; Lottersberger, F.; Koch, S.; Moor, A. E.; Sun, X.-F.; von Castelmur, E.; Sheng, G.; Cantu', C.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571901\nWnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear {beta}-catenin. Furthermore, neoplasia of the colorectal epithelium begins with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Yet, little is known about how {beta}-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. We have previously identified the developmental transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is present and functionally active in human colorectal cancers. TBX3s genomic binding pattern suggests a regulatory role that broadly coincides with that of Wnt/{beta}-catenin. Moreover, proteomics proximity labelling indicated that, during Wnt pathway activation, TBX3 is vicinal to several protein partners, including the transcription factors TCF/LEF and chromatin remodeling complexes which are usually found at Wnt responsive elements. Sequence and structure analysis revealed that TBX3 possesses an exposed Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif predicted by AlphaFold2 Multimer to mediate direct interactions with several Wnt-activated TBX3 partners. Deletion of NPF abrogates TBX3 proximity to these partners and its ability to modulate Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin in colorectal cancer, and its mechanism of action exposes a novel druggable protein-interaction surface.\nLearning a conserved mechanism for early neuroectoderm morphogenesis\nAuthors: Lefebvre, M. F.; Colen, J.; Claussen, N. H.; Brauns, F.; Raich, M. K.; Mitchell, N.; Fruchart, M.; Vitelli, V.; Streichan, S. J.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573058\nMorphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.\nLive-imaging reveals Coordinated Cell Migration and Cardiac Fate Determination during Mammalian Gastrulation.\nAuthors: Abukar, S.; Embacher, P.; Cicarrelli, A.; Varsani-Brown, S.; Dean, J. A.; Briscoe, J.; Ivanovitch, k.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572445\nHeart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.\nMaternal SMARCA5 is required for major ZGA in mouse embryos\nAuthors: Kubinyecz, O. N.; Drage, D.; Santos Constancia, M. d. F.; Krueger, C.; Okkenhaug, H.; Alda-Catalinas, C.; Eckersley-Maslin, M.; Taubenschmid-Stowers, J.; Reik, W.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570276\nZygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mice takes place in two waves, a minor wave in the one-cell embryo, and a major wave at the two-cell stage, both accompanied by global transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. However, the orchestration of these reprogramming events by maternal factors deposited in the oocyte is not yet entirely understood. We and others have recently shown that epigenetic modifiers such as SMARCA5 (the main ATPase in ISWI complexes) can initiate the ZGA transcriptional programme in vitro. So far, the role of SMARCA5 in ZGA in vivo has not been addressed, as constitutive knock-out mice lacking SMARCA5 are not viable. We have overcome this limitation by using the targeted protein-depletion system Trim Away to degrade SMARCA5 in early zygotes. We further harnessed the power of single cell multi-omics (scNMT-seq) and showed that in the absence of SMARCA5, major ZGA genes fail to be upregulated at the two-cell stage. This is explained by the lower accessibility and disrupted nucleosome positioning at their promoters and distal regulatory regions, compared to wild-type embryos. In contrast, we show that global chromatin accessibility at the two-cell stage is higher in SMARCA5 depleted embryos compared to control embryos, and this is accompanied by other global structural changes involving heterochromatic regions. Our results show that SMARCA5 has a global regulatory role at the two-cell stage, which includes the control of ZGA gene promoters and distal regulatory regions.\nElasto-Plastic Transition in Epithelial Folding\nAuthors: Teranishi, A.; Mori, M.; Ichiki, R.; Toda, S.; Shioi, G.; Okuda, S.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572470\nDuring morphogenesis, epithelial sheets fold sequentially to make up three-dimensional organ structures. The resulting fold is irreversible, thereby allowing morphogenesis to proceed unidirectionally. However, how the irreversibility of folding is established remains unclear. We report a novel mechanical property of epithelia that is responsible for folding irreversibility. In ex vivo and in vitro cultures, epithelia exhibit an elastic response and restore their original shapes when folding is induced by short-term mechanical indentation. In contrast, long-term indentation induces a plastic response, resulting in irreversible deformation. Remarkably, the transition from an elastic to a plastic response occurs in a switch-like manner with a critical duration. This transition is established by the accumulation of F-actin into a bracket-like structure across the fold, with the critical duration determined and tunable by the actin polymerization rate. Bracket formation and the resulting transition require two mechanosensing pathways: TRPC3/6-mediated calcium influx and ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. While each pathway is independently triggered by deformation, calcium influx specifically occurs at the fold under EGFR activation. These results demonstrated that cells control epithelial folding irreversibility by detecting the temporal characteristics of deformation and adaptively switching between elastic and plastic responses. This finding, thus, resolves a long-standing question concerning the directionality of morphogenesis.\nTemporal recording of mammalian development and precancer\nAuthors: Islam, M.; Yang, Y.; Simmons, A.

J.; Lau, K.\nScore: 7.5, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572260\nKey to understanding many biological phenomena is knowing the temporal ordering of cellular events, which often require continuous direct observations [1, 2]. An alternative solution involves the utilization of irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using NSC-seq, a newly designed and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, while incorporating assigned cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development and identified new intestinal epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas and single-cell multi-omic profiling of human precancers as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), including 116 scRNA-seq datasets and clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers, revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Thus, our multimodal framework augments existing single-cell analyses and lays the foundation for in vivo multimodal recording, enabling the tracking of lineage and temporal events during development and tumorigenesis.\nSingle cell proteomics characterization of bone marrow hematopoiesis with distinct Ras pathway lesions.\nAuthors: Karra, L.; Finger, A.-M.; Shechtman, L.; Krush, M.; Meng-Yao Huang, R.; Prinz, M.; Tennvooren, I.; Bahl, K.; Hysenaj, L.; Gonzalez, P.; combes, a.

Stem- and progenitor- cells need to balance dormancy with proliferation. How genetic alterations impact frequency, lineage potential, and metabolism of HSC is largely unknown. Here, we compared induced expression of KRASG12D or RasGRP1 to normal hematopoiesis. At low-resolution, both Ras pathway lesions result in skewing towards myeloid lineages. Single-cell resolution CyTOF proteomics unmasked an expansion of HSC- and progenitor- compartments for RasGRP1, contrasted by a depletion for KRASG12D. SCENITH quantitates protein synthesis with single-cell precision and corroborated that immature cells display low metabolic SCENITH rates. Both RasGRP1 and KRASG12D elevated mean SCENITH signals in immature cells. However, RasGRP1-overexpressing stem cells retain a metabolically quiescent cell-fraction, whereas this fraction diminishes for KRASG12D. Our temporal single cell proteomics and metabolomics datasets provide a resource of mechanistic insights into altered hematopoiesis at single cell resolution.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The somatosensory system detects peripheral stimuli that are translated into behaviors necessary for survival. Fishes and amphibians possess two somatosensory systems in the trunk: the primary somatosensory system, formed by the Rohon-Beard neurons, and the secondary somatosensory system, formed by the neural crest cell-derived neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Visual systems provide a key interface between organisms and their surroundings, and have evolved in many forms to perform diverse functions across the animal kingdom. Spiders exhibit a range of visual abilities and ecologies, the diversity of which is underpinned by a highly versatile, modular visual system architecture. This typically includes eight eyes of two developmentally distinct types, but the number, size, location, and function of the eyes can vary dramatically between lineages. Previous studies of visual system development in spiders have confirmed that many components of the retinal determination gene (RDG) network are conserved in common with other arthropods, but so far, comparative studies among spiders are lacking. We characterised visual system development in eight species of spiders representing a range of morphologies, visual ecologies, and phylogenetic positions, to determine how these diverse configurations are formed, and how they might evolve. Combining synchrotron radiation tomography, transcriptomics, in situ hybridisation, and selection analyses, we describe the repertoires and expression of key RDGs in relation to adult morphology, and identify key molecular players, timepoints, and developmental events that may contribute to adult diversity. In particular, we discuss the molecular and developmental underpinnings of eye size, number, position, and identity across spiders, and highlight key areas for further functional analyses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones -- testosterone and estrogen -- regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated downstream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Wnt signaling orchestrates gene expression in a plethora of processes during development and adult cell homeostasis via the action of nuclear {beta}-catenin. Furthermore, neoplasia of the colorectal epithelium begins with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Yet, little is known about how {beta}-catenin generates context-specific transcriptional outcomes. We have previously identified the developmental transcription factor TBX3 as a tissue-specific component of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin nuclear complex during mouse forelimb development. In this study, we show that TBX3 is present and functionally active in human colorectal cancers. TBX3s genomic binding pattern suggests a regulatory role that broadly coincides with that of Wnt/{beta}-catenin. Moreover, proteomics proximity labelling indicated that, during Wnt pathway activation, TBX3 is vicinal to several protein partners, including the transcription factors TCF/LEF and chromatin remodeling complexes which are usually found at Wnt responsive elements. Sequence and structure analysis revealed that TBX3 possesses an exposed Asp-Pro-Phe (NPF) motif predicted by AlphaFold2 Multimer to mediate direct interactions with several Wnt-activated TBX3 partners. Deletion of NPF abrogates TBX3 proximity to these partners and its ability to modulate Wnt-dependent transcription. TBX3 emerges as a key modulator of the oncogenic activity of Wnt/{beta}-catenin in colorectal cancer, and its mechanism of action exposes a novel druggable protein-interaction surface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mice takes place in two waves, a minor wave in the one-cell embryo, and a major wave at the two-cell stage, both accompanied by global transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. However, the orchestration of these reprogramming events by maternal factors deposited in the oocyte is not yet entirely understood. We and others have recently shown that epigenetic modifiers such as SMARCA5 (the main ATPase in ISWI complexes) can initiate the ZGA transcriptional programme in vitro. So far, the role of SMARCA5 in ZGA in vivo has not been addressed, as constitutive knock-out mice lacking SMARCA5 are not viable. We have overcome this limitation by using the targeted protein-depletion system Trim Away to degrade SMARCA5 in early zygotes. We further harnessed the power of single cell multi-omics (scNMT-seq) and showed that in the absence of SMARCA5, major ZGA genes fail to be upregulated at the two-cell stage. This is explained by the lower accessibility and disrupted nucleosome positioning at their promoters and distal regulatory regions, compared to wild-type embryos. In contrast, we show that global chromatin accessibility at the two-cell stage is higher in SMARCA5 depleted embryos compared to control embryos, and this is accompanied by other global structural changes involving heterochromatic regions. Our results show that SMARCA5 has a global regulatory role at the two-cell stage, which includes the control of ZGA gene promoters and distal regulatory regions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During morphogenesis, epithelial sheets fold sequentially to make up three-dimensional organ structures. The resulting fold is irreversible, thereby allowing morphogenesis to proceed unidirectionally. However, how the irreversibility of folding is established remains unclear. We report a novel mechanical property of epithelia that is responsible for folding irreversibility. In ex vivo and in vitro cultures, epithelia exhibit an elastic response and restore their original shapes when folding is induced by short-term mechanical indentation. In contrast, long-term indentation induces a plastic response, resulting in irreversible deformation. Remarkably, the transition from an elastic to a plastic response occurs in a switch-like manner with a critical duration. This transition is established by the accumulation of F-actin into a bracket-like structure across the fold, with the critical duration determined and tunable by the actin polymerization rate. Bracket formation and the resulting transition require two mechanosensing pathways: TRPC3/6-mediated calcium influx and ligand-independent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. While each pathway is independently triggered by deformation, calcium influx specifically occurs at the fold under EGFR activation. These results demonstrated that cells control epithelial folding irreversibility by detecting the temporal characteristics of deformation and adaptively switching between elastic and plastic responses. This finding, thus, resolves a long-standing question concerning the directionality of morphogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Key to understanding many biological phenomena is knowing the temporal ordering of cellular events, which often require continuous direct observations [1, 2]. An alternative solution involves the utilization of irreversible genetic changes, such as naturally occurring mutations, to create indelible markers that enables retrospective temporal ordering [3-8]. Using NSC-seq, a newly designed and validated multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform, we developed a molecular clock approach to record the timing of cellular events and clonality in vivo, while incorporating assigned cell state and lineage information. Using this approach, we uncovered precise timing of tissue-specific cell expansion during murine embryonic development and identified new intestinal epithelial progenitor states by their unique genetic histories. NSC-seq analysis of murine adenomas and single-cell multi-omic profiling of human precancers as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), including 116 scRNA-seq datasets and clonal analysis of 418 human polyps, demonstrated the occurrence of polyancestral initiation in 15-30% of colonic precancers, revealing their origins from multiple normal founders. Thus, our multimodal framework augments existing single-cell analyses and lays the foundation for in vivo multimodal recording, enabling the tracking of lineage and temporal events during development and tumorigenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Normal hematopoiesis requires constant prolific production of different blood cell lineages by multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Stem- and progenitor- cells need to balance dormancy with proliferation. How genetic alterations impact frequency, lineage potential, and metabolism of HSC is largely unknown. Here, we compared induced expression of KRASG12D or RasGRP1 to normal hematopoiesis. At low-resolution, both Ras pathway lesions result in skewing towards myeloid lineages. Single-cell resolution CyTOF proteomics unmasked an expansion of HSC- and progenitor- compartments for RasGRP1, contrasted by a depletion for KRASG12D. SCENITH quantitates protein synthesis with single-cell precision and corroborated that immature cells display low metabolic SCENITH rates. Both RasGRP1 and KRASG12D elevated mean SCENITH signals in immature cells. However, RasGRP1-overexpressing stem cells retain a metabolically quiescent cell-fraction, whereas this fraction diminishes for KRASG12D. Our temporal single cell proteomics and metabolomics datasets provide a resource of mechanistic insights into altered hematopoiesis at single cell resolution.</p>
