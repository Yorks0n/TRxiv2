J.; McClain, M.; Weaver, K.; Delventhal, K.; Morrison, J. A.; McKinney, M. C.; McKinney, S. A.; Sanchez Alvarado, A.\nScore: 75.0, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577494\nCamera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.\nSomite-independent regeneration of the axolotl primary body axis\nAuthors: Masselink, W.; Gerber, T.; Falcon, F.; Deshayes, T.; Papadopoulos, S.-C.; Pende, M.; Singh Jamwal, V.; Taniguchi-Sugiura, Y.; Lin, T.-Y.; Kurth, T.; Wang, J.; Arendt, D.; Fei, J.-F.; Treutlein, B.; Tanaka, E. M.; Murawala, P.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.577464\nPrimary body axis development is a highly conserved process that proceeds through somitogenesis and further subdivision into dermatome, myotome, and sclerotome. Defects in somitic-clock genes such as Hes7 lead to vertebral segmentation defects in mice and fish. Here we show that in the axolotl, Hes7 is also necessary for proper embryonic vertebral segmentation but is, surprisingly, dispensable during axolotl tail regeneration. Using genetic barcoding and fate mapping we found that during regeneration, the somitic derivatives (muscle, cartilage, tendon, fibroblasts) arose from tendon-like, Lfng+ multi-potent stem cells residing at the myotendonal junction that we term asomitic stem cells. Throughout homeostasis and regeneration these stem cells display a distinct gene regulatory state compared to developmental progenitors with comparable lineage potential. These observations contrast to axolotl limb regeneration that proceeds via fibroblast dedifferentiation and the subsequent recapitulation of a limb developmental program. Taken together our research shows that divergent strategies are deployed between limb and tail regeneration, and that regeneration of complex body parts does not necessarily involve the complete redeployment of developmental programs.\nA feather star is born: embryonic development and nervous system organization in the crinoid Antedon mediterranea\nAuthors: Mercurio, S.; Gattoni, G.; Scari, G.; Ascagni, M.; Barzaghi, B.; Elphick, M. R.; Benito-Gutierrez, E.; Pennati, R.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577964\nBackgroundCrinoids belong to the phylum Echinodermata, marine invertebrates with a highly derived pentaradial body plan. As the only living members of the Pelmatozoa, the sister group to other extant echinoderms, crinoids are in a key phylogenetic position to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this phylum. However, the development of crinoids has been scarcely investigated, limiting their potential for comparative studies. Many crinoids are difficult to collect in the wild and embryo manipulation is challenging. Conversely, the Mediterranean feather star Antedon mediterranea can be found in shallow waters and has been used for experimental studies, most notably to investigate regeneration. ResultsThe aim here was to establish A. mediterranea as an experimental system for developmental biology. To accomplish this, we set up a method for culturing embryos in vitro from zygote to hatching larva stage that allowed us to define a developmental timeline and a standardized staging system for this species. We then optimized protocols to characterize the development of the main structures of the feather star body plan, using a combination of microscopy techniques and whole mount immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization chain reaction. Focusing on the nervous system, we show that the larval apical organ includes a combination of serotonergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that form under the influence of a conserved anterior molecular signature. The larval neural plexus is instead composed of glutamatergic neurons and develops during the formation of the ciliary bands. Larval neurons disappear at metamorphosis, and the ectoneural and entoneural components of the adult nervous system develop early in post-metamorphic stages. Furthermore, the oral ectoderm that contains the ectoneural system acquires an \"anterior\" signature expressing Six3/6 and Lhx2/9 orthologs. ConclusionsOur results deepen our knowledge on crinoid development and provide new techniques to investigate feather star embryogenesis, promoting the use of A. mediterranea in developmental and evolutionary biology. This in turn will pave the way for the inclusion of crinoids in comparative studies to understand the origin of the echinoderm body plan and clarify many unanswered questions on deuterostome evolution.\nA Comprehensive Human Embryogenesis Reference Tool using Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data\nAuthors: Zhao, C.; Plaza Reyes, A.; Schell, J. P.; Weltner, J.; Ortega, N.; Zheng, Y.; Bjorklund, A. K.; Baque-Vidal, L.; Sokka, J.; Trokovic, R.; Cox, B. J.; Rossant, J.; Fu, J.; Petropoulos, S.; Lanner, F.\nScore: 54.7, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2021.05.07.442980\nStem cell-based embryo models offer unprecedented experimental tools for studying early human development. The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.\nHarnessing the regenerative potential of interleukin11 to enhance heart repair\nAuthors: Shin, K.; Rodriguez-Parks, A.; Xia, Y.; Dong, C.; Kelles, S.; Cao, J.; Kang, J.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577788\nBalancing between regenerative processes and fibrosis is crucial for heart repair1. However, strategies to regulate the balance between these two process are a barrier to the development of effective therapies for heart regeneration. While Interleukin 11 (IL11) is known as a fibrotic factor for the heart2-4, its contribution to heart regeneration remains poorly understood. Here, we uncovered that il11a can initiate robust regenerative programs in the zebrafish heart, including cell cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and coronary expansion, even in the absence of injury. However, the prolonged il11a induction in uninjured hearts causes persistent fibroblast emergence, resulting in cardiac fibrosis. While deciphering the regenerative and fibrotic effects, we found that il11-dependent fibrosis, but not il11-dependent regeneration, is mediated through ERK activity, implying that the dual effects of il11a on regeneration and fibrosis can be uncoupled. To harness the regenerative ability of il11a for injured hearts, we devised a combinatorial treatment through il11a induction with ERK inhibition. Using this approach, we observed enhanced CM proliferation with mitigated fibrosis, achieving a balance between stimulating regenerative processes and curbing fibrotic outcomes. Thus, our findings unveil the mechanistic insights into regenerative roles of il11 signaling, offering the potential therapeutic avenues that utilizes a paracrine regenerative factor to foster cardiac repair without exacerbating the fibrotic responses.\nHepatoblast iterative apicobasal polarization is regulated by extracellular matrix remodeling\nAuthors: Delpierre, J.; Valenzuela, J. I.; Bovyn, M.; Martins, N. P.; Belicova, L.; Repnik, U.; Bebelman, M.; Seifert, S.; Haas, P. A.; Kalaidzidis, Y. L.; Zerial, M.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578046\nHepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.\nRole of Fibronectin in Postnatal Skeletal Development\nAuthors: Dinesh, N. E. H.; Baratang, N. P.; Rosseau, J.; Mohapatra, R.; Li, L.; Mahalingam, R.; Tiedemann, K.; Campeau, P. M.; Reinhardt, D. P.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578475\nFibronectin (FN) is a ubiquitous matrix glycoprotein essential for the physiological development of various tissues. Mutations in FN cause a form of skeletal dysplasia, emphasizing the importance of FN in cartilage and bone development. However, the relevance and functional role of FN during skeletal development remains elusive. We employed conditional knockout mouse models for the cellular FN isoform in cartilage (cFNKO), the plasma FN isoform in hepatocytes (pFNKO), and a double knockout (FNdKO) to determine the relevance of these two principal FN isoforms in postnatal skeletal development spanning from P1 to 2 months of age. We identified a unique topological FN deposition pattern in the mouse limb with prominent levels at the resting and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones and in the trabecular bone. Circulating pFN did not enter the growth plate and was limited to the primary ossification center, whereas cartilage-specific cFN was detected as the major isoform in epiphyseal cartilage. Deletion of either one of the isoforms in single knockouts (cFNKO or pFNKO) only led to subtle changes in some of the analyzed parameters. Complete ablation of both cFN in the growth plate and circulating pFN in plasma resulted in significantly reduced postnatal body weight, body length, and bone length in the FNdKO mice. Assessment of the FNdKO adult bone microarchitecture using micro-CT revealed significantly reduced trabecular bone volume, trabecular network, bone mineral density, and increased bone marrow adiposity. Analysis of chondrogenesis in FNdKO mice showed changes in the proliferating and hypertrophic growth plate zones, consistent alterations in chondrogenic markers such as collagen type II and type X, reduced apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and downregulation of bone formation markers. FNdKO mice also displayed decreased levels of transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF{beta}1) and downstream phospho-AKT levels, which are critical regulators of chondrogenesis and bone formation. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that FN is essential for proper chondrogenesis and postnatal bone development. Simultaneous deletion of both FN isoforms in the developing cartilage leads to critical TGF{beta}-mediated alterations in chondrogenic differentiation, resulting in bone and skeletal defects.\nmiR-26 deficiency causes alterations in lens transcriptome and results in adult-onset cataract\nAuthors: Upreti, A.; Hoang, T. V.; Li, M.; Tangeman, J. A.; Dierker, D. S.; Wagner, B. D.; Tsonis, P. A.; Liang, C.; Lachke, S. A.; Robinson, M. L.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577818\nPurposeDespite strong evidence demonstrating that normal lens development requires regulation governed by miRNAs, the functional role of specific miRNAs in mammalian lens development remains largely unexplored. MethodsA comprehensive analysis of miRNA transcripts in the newborn mouse lens, exploring both differential expression between lens epithelial cells and lens fiber cells and overall miRNA abundance was conducted by miRNA-seq. Mouse lenses lacking each of three abundantly expressed lens miRNAs: miR-184, miR-26 and miR-1 were analyzed to explore the role of these miRNAs in lens development. ResultsMice lacking all three copies of miR-26 (miR-26TKO) developed postnatal cataracts as early as 4-6 weeks of age. RNA-seq analysis of neonatal lenses from miR-26TKO mice exhibited abnormal reduced expression of a cohort of genes found to be lens-enriched and linked to cataract (e.g. Foxe3, Hsf4, Mip, Tdrd7, and numerous crystallin genes), and abnormal elevated expression of genes related to neural development (Lhx3, Neurod4, Shisa7, Elavl3), inflammation (Ccr1, Tnfrsf12a, Csf2ra), the complement pathway, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (Tnfrsf1a, Ccl7, Stat3, Cntfr). ConclusionmiR-1, miR-184 and miR-26 are each dispensable for normal embryonic lens development. However, loss of miR-26 causes lens transcriptome changes and drives cataract formation.\nSoma-to-germline BMP signal is essential for Drosophila spermiogenesis\nAuthors: Beard, E. K.; Norris, R. P.; Furusho, M.; Terasaki, M.; Inaba, M.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578090\nIn the Drosophila testis, developing germ cells are encapsulated by somatic support cells throughout development. Soma-germline interactions are essential for successful spermiogenesis. However, it is still not fully understood what signaling events take place between the soma and the germline. In this study, we found that a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand, Glass bottom boat (Gbb), secreted from somatic cyst cells (CCs), signals to differentiating germ cells to maintain proper spermiogenesis. Knockdown of Gbb in CCs or the type I BMP receptor Saxophone (Sax) in germ cells leads to a defect in sperm head bundling and decreased fertility. Our Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the mutant germ cells have aberrant morphology of mitochondria throughout the stages of spermiogenesis and exhibit a defect in nebenkern formation. Elongating spermatids show uncoupled nuclei and elongating mitochondrial derivatives, suggesting that improper mitochondrial development may cause the sperm bundling defect. Taken together we propose a new role of soma-derived BMP signaling, which is essential for spermiogenesis.\nExpression patterns of FGF and BMP pathway genes in the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris\nAuthors: Heikes, K. L.; Goldstein, B.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577774\nA small number of conserved signaling pathways regulate development of most animals, yet we do not know where these pathways are deployed in most embryos. This includes tardigrades, a phylum with a unique body shape. We examined expression patterns of components of the BMP and FGF signaling pathways during embryonic segmentation and mesoderm development of the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris. Among the patterns examined, we found that an FGF ligand gene is expressed in ectodermal segment posteriors and an FGF receptor gene is expressed in underlying endomesodermal pouches, suggesting possible FGF signaling between these developing germ layers. We found that a BMP ligand gene is expressed in lateral ectoderm and dorsolateral bands along segment posteriors, while the BMP antagonist Sog gene is expressed in lateral ectoderm and also in a subset of endomesodermal cells, suggesting a possible role of BMP signaling in dorsal-ventral patterning of lateral ectoderm. In combination with known roles of these pathways during development of common model systems, we developed hypotheses for how the BMP and FGF pathways might regulate embryo segmentation and mesoderm formation of the tardigrade H. exemplaris. These results identify the expression patterns of genes from two conserved signaling pathways for the first time in the tardigrade phylum.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Camera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Primary body axis development is a highly conserved process that proceeds through somitogenesis and further subdivision into dermatome, myotome, and sclerotome. Defects in somitic-clock genes such as Hes7 lead to vertebral segmentation defects in mice and fish. Here we show that in the axolotl, Hes7 is also necessary for proper embryonic vertebral segmentation but is, surprisingly, dispensable during axolotl tail regeneration. Using genetic barcoding and fate mapping we found that during regeneration, the somitic derivatives (muscle, cartilage, tendon, fibroblasts) arose from tendon-like, Lfng&#43; multi-potent stem cells residing at the myotendonal junction that we term asomitic stem cells. Throughout homeostasis and regeneration these stem cells display a distinct gene regulatory state compared to developmental progenitors with comparable lineage potential. These observations contrast to axolotl limb regeneration that proceeds via fibroblast dedifferentiation and the subsequent recapitulation of a limb developmental program. Taken together our research shows that divergent strategies are deployed between limb and tail regeneration, and that regeneration of complex body parts does not necessarily involve the complete redeployment of developmental programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCrinoids belong to the phylum Echinodermata, marine invertebrates with a highly derived pentaradial body plan. As the only living members of the Pelmatozoa, the sister group to other extant echinoderms, crinoids are in a key phylogenetic position to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this phylum. However, the development of crinoids has been scarcely investigated, limiting their potential for comparative studies. Many crinoids are difficult to collect in the wild and embryo manipulation is challenging. Conversely, the Mediterranean feather star Antedon mediterranea can be found in shallow waters and has been used for experimental studies, most notably to investigate regeneration.

ResultsThe aim here was to establish A. mediterranea as an experimental system for developmental biology. To accomplish this, we set up a method for culturing embryos in vitro from zygote to hatching larva stage that allowed us to define a developmental timeline and a standardized staging system for this species. We then optimized protocols to characterize the development of the main structures of the feather star body plan, using a combination of microscopy techniques and whole mount immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization chain reaction. Focusing on the nervous system, we show that the larval apical organ includes a combination of serotonergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that form under the influence of a conserved anterior molecular signature. The larval neural plexus is instead composed of glutamatergic neurons and develops during the formation of the ciliary bands. Larval neurons disappear at metamorphosis, and the ectoneural and entoneural components of the adult nervous system develop early in post-metamorphic stages. Furthermore, the oral ectoderm that contains the ectoneural system acquires an &#34;anterior&#34; signature expressing Six3/6 and Lhx2/9 orthologs.

ConclusionsOur results deepen our knowledge on crinoid development and provide new techniques to investigate feather star embryogenesis, promoting the use of A. mediterranea in developmental and evolutionary biology. This in turn will pave the way for the inclusion of crinoids in comparative studies to understand the origin of the echinoderm body plan and clarify many unanswered questions on deuterostome evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem cell-based embryo models offer unprecedented experimental tools for studying early human development. The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Balancing between regenerative processes and fibrosis is crucial for heart repair1. However, strategies to regulate the balance between these two process are a barrier to the development of effective therapies for heart regeneration. While Interleukin 11 (IL11) is known as a fibrotic factor for the heart2-4, its contribution to heart regeneration remains poorly understood. Here, we uncovered that il11a can initiate robust regenerative programs in the zebrafish heart, including cell cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and coronary expansion, even in the absence of injury. However, the prolonged il11a induction in uninjured hearts causes persistent fibroblast emergence, resulting in cardiac fibrosis. While deciphering the regenerative and fibrotic effects, we found that il11-dependent fibrosis, but not il11-dependent regeneration, is mediated through ERK activity, implying that the dual effects of il11a on regeneration and fibrosis can be uncoupled. To harness the regenerative ability of il11a for injured hearts, we devised a combinatorial treatment through il11a induction with ERK inhibition. Using this approach, we observed enhanced CM proliferation with mitigated fibrosis, achieving a balance between stimulating regenerative processes and curbing fibrotic outcomes. Thus, our findings unveil the mechanistic insights into regenerative roles of il11 signaling, offering the potential therapeutic avenues that utilizes a paracrine regenerative factor to foster cardiac repair without exacerbating the fibrotic responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fibronectin (FN) is a ubiquitous matrix glycoprotein essential for the physiological development of various tissues. Mutations in FN cause a form of skeletal dysplasia, emphasizing the importance of FN in cartilage and bone development. However, the relevance and functional role of FN during skeletal development remains elusive. We employed conditional knockout mouse models for the cellular FN isoform in cartilage (cFNKO), the plasma FN isoform in hepatocytes (pFNKO), and a double knockout (FNdKO) to determine the relevance of these two principal FN isoforms in postnatal skeletal development spanning from P1 to 2 months of age. We identified a unique topological FN deposition pattern in the mouse limb with prominent levels at the resting and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones and in the trabecular bone. Circulating pFN did not enter the growth plate and was limited to the primary ossification center, whereas cartilage-specific cFN was detected as the major isoform in epiphyseal cartilage. Deletion of either one of the isoforms in single knockouts (cFNKO or pFNKO) only led to subtle changes in some of the analyzed parameters. Complete ablation of both cFN in the growth plate and circulating pFN in plasma resulted in significantly reduced postnatal body weight, body length, and bone length in the FNdKO mice. Assessment of the FNdKO adult bone microarchitecture using micro-CT revealed significantly reduced trabecular bone volume, trabecular network, bone mineral density, and increased bone marrow adiposity. Analysis of chondrogenesis in FNdKO mice showed changes in the proliferating and hypertrophic growth plate zones, consistent alterations in chondrogenic markers such as collagen type II and type X, reduced apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and downregulation of bone formation markers. FNdKO mice also displayed decreased levels of transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF{beta}1) and downstream phospho-AKT levels, which are critical regulators of chondrogenesis and bone formation. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that FN is essential for proper chondrogenesis and postnatal bone development. Simultaneous deletion of both FN isoforms in the developing cartilage leads to critical TGF{beta}-mediated alterations in chondrogenic differentiation, resulting in bone and skeletal defects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeDespite strong evidence demonstrating that normal lens development requires regulation governed by miRNAs, the functional role of specific miRNAs in mammalian lens development remains largely unexplored.

MethodsA comprehensive analysis of miRNA transcripts in the newborn mouse lens, exploring both differential expression between lens epithelial cells and lens fiber cells and overall miRNA abundance was conducted by miRNA-seq. Mouse lenses lacking each of three abundantly expressed lens miRNAs: miR-184, miR-26 and miR-1 were analyzed to explore the role of these miRNAs in lens development.

ResultsMice lacking all three copies of miR-26 (miR-26TKO) developed postnatal cataracts as early as 4-6 weeks of age. RNA-seq analysis of neonatal lenses from miR-26TKO mice exhibited abnormal reduced expression of a cohort of genes found to be lens-enriched and linked to cataract (e.g. Foxe3, Hsf4, Mip, Tdrd7, and numerous crystallin genes), and abnormal elevated expression of genes related to neural development (Lhx3, Neurod4, Shisa7, Elavl3), inflammation (Ccr1, Tnfrsf12a, Csf2ra), the complement pathway, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (Tnfrsf1a, Ccl7, Stat3, Cntfr).

ConclusionmiR-1, miR-184 and miR-26 are each dispensable for normal embryonic lens development. However, loss of miR-26 causes lens transcriptome changes and drives cataract formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the Drosophila testis, developing germ cells are encapsulated by somatic support cells throughout development. Soma-germline interactions are essential for successful spermiogenesis. However, it is still not fully understood what signaling events take place between the soma and the germline. In this study, we found that a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand, Glass bottom boat (Gbb), secreted from somatic cyst cells (CCs), signals to differentiating germ cells to maintain proper spermiogenesis. Knockdown of Gbb in CCs or the type I BMP receptor Saxophone (Sax) in germ cells leads to a defect in sperm head bundling and decreased fertility. Our Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the mutant germ cells have aberrant morphology of mitochondria throughout the stages of spermiogenesis and exhibit a defect in nebenkern formation. Elongating spermatids show uncoupled nuclei and elongating mitochondrial derivatives, suggesting that improper mitochondrial development may cause the sperm bundling defect. Taken together we propose a new role of soma-derived BMP signaling, which is essential for spermiogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A small number of conserved signaling pathways regulate development of most animals, yet we do not know where these pathways are deployed in most embryos. This includes tardigrades, a phylum with a unique body shape. We examined expression patterns of components of the BMP and FGF signaling pathways during embryonic segmentation and mesoderm development of the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris. Among the patterns examined, we found that an FGF ligand gene is expressed in ectodermal segment posteriors and an FGF receptor gene is expressed in underlying endomesodermal pouches, suggesting possible FGF signaling between these developing germ layers. We found that a BMP ligand gene is expressed in lateral ectoderm and dorsolateral bands along segment posteriors, while the BMP antagonist Sog gene is expressed in lateral ectoderm and also in a subset of endomesodermal cells, suggesting a possible role of BMP signaling in dorsal-ventral patterning of lateral ectoderm. In combination with known roles of these pathways during development of common model systems, we developed hypotheses for how the BMP and FGF pathways might regulate embryo segmentation and mesoderm formation of the tardigrade H. exemplaris. These results identify the expression patterns of genes from two conserved signaling pathways for the first time in the tardigrade phylum.</p>
