M.; Pechmann, M.; Telizhenko, V.; Pande, A.; Kosiol, C.; McGregor, A. P.; Sumner-Rooney, L.\nScore: 20.9, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572789\nVisual systems provide a key interface between organisms and their surroundings, and have evolved in many forms to perform diverse functions across the animal kingdom. Spiders exhibit a range of visual abilities and ecologies, the diversity of which is underpinned by a highly versatile, modular visual system architecture. This typically includes eight eyes of two developmentally distinct types, but the number, size, location, and function of the eyes can vary dramatically between lineages. Previous studies of visual system development in spiders have confirmed that many components of the retinal determination gene (RDG) network are conserved in common with other arthropods, but so far, comparative studies among spiders are lacking. We characterised visual system development in eight species of spiders representing a range of morphologies, visual ecologies, and phylogenetic positions, to determine how these diverse configurations are formed, and how they might evolve. Combining synchrotron radiation tomography, transcriptomics, in situ hybridisation, and selection analyses, we describe the repertoires and expression of key RDGs in relation to adult morphology, and identify key molecular players, timepoints, and developmental events that may contribute to adult diversity. In particular, we discuss the molecular and developmental underpinnings of eye size, number, position, and identity across spiders, and highlight key areas for further functional analyses.\nSteroid signaling controls sex-specific development in an invertebrate\nAuthors: Grmai, L.; Jimenez, E.; Baxter, K.; Van Doren, M.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573099\nIn vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.\nLearning a conserved mechanism for early neuroectoderm morphogenesis\nAuthors: Lefebvre, M. F.; Colen, J.; Claussen, N. H.; Brauns, F.; Raich, M. K.; Mitchell, N.; Fruchart, M.; Vitelli, V.; Streichan, S. J.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573058\nMorphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.\nGene module reconstruction elucidates cellular differentiation processes and the regulatory logic of specialized secretion\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Liu, J.; Du, L. Y.; Wyss, J. L.; Farrell, J. A.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573643\nDuring differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system: the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.\nLive-imaging reveals Coordinated Cell Migration and Cardiac Fate Determination during Mammalian Gastrulation.\nAuthors: Abukar, S.; Embacher, P.; Cicarrelli, A.; Varsani-Brown, S.; Dean, J. A.; Briscoe, J.; Ivanovitch, k.\nScore: 11.2, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572445\nHeart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.\nDNA replication in early mammalian embryos is patterned, predisposing lamina-associated regions to fragility\nAuthors: Xu, S.; Wang, N.; Zuccaro, M.; Gerhardt, J.; Baslan, T.; Koren, A.; Egli, D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-12-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.573304\nDNA replication in differentiated cells follows a defined program, but when and how it is established during mammalian development is not known. Here we show using single-cell sequencing, that both bovine and mouse cleavage stage embryos progress through S-phase in a defined pattern. Late replicating regions are associated with the nuclear lamina from the first cell cycle after fertilization, and contain few active origins, and few but long genes. Chromosome breaks, which form spontaneously in bovine embryos at sites concordant with human embryos, preferentially locate to late replicating regions. In mice, late replicating regions show enhanced fragility due to a sparsity of dormant origins that can be activated under conditions of replication stress. This pattern predisposes regions with long neuronal genes to fragility and genetic change prior to segregation of soma and germ line. Our studies show that the formation of early and late replicating regions is among the first layers of epigenetic regulation established on the mammalian genome after fertilization.\nDirect Male Development in Chromosomally ZZ Zebrafish\nAuthors: Wilson, C. A.; Batzel, P.; Postlethwait, J. H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.573483\nThe genetics of sex determination varies across taxa, sometimes even within a species. Major domesticated strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including AB and TU, lack a strong genetic sex determining locus, but strains more recently derived from nature, like Nadia (NA), possess a ZZ male/ZW female chromosomal sex-determination system. AB strain fish pass through a juvenile ovary stage, forming oocytes that survive in fish that become females but die in fish that become males. To understand mechanisms of gonad development in NA zebrafish, we studied histology and single cell transcriptomics in developing ZZ and ZW fish. ZW fish developed oocytes by 22 days post-fertilization (dpf) but ZZ fish directly formed testes, avoiding a juvenile ovary phase. Gonads of some ZW and WW fish, however, developed oocytes that died as the gonad became a testis, mimicking AB fish, suggesting that the gynogenetically derived AB strain is chromosomally WW. Single-cell RNA-seq of 19dpf gonads showed similar cell types in ZZ and ZW fish, including germ cells, precursors of gonadal support cells, steroidogenic cells, interstitial/stromal cells, and immune cells, consistent with a bipotential juvenile gonad. In contrast, scRNA-seq of 30dpf gonads revealed that cells in ZZ gonads had transcriptomes characteristic of testicular Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells while ZW gonads had granulosa cells, theca cells, and developing oocytes. Hematopoietic and vascular cells were similar in both sex genotypes. These results show that juvenile NA zebrafish initially develop a bipotential gonad; that a factor on the NA W chromosome or fewer than two Z chromosomes is essential to initiate oocyte development; and without the W factor or with two Z doses, NA gonads develop directly into testes without passing through the juvenile ovary stage. Sex determination in AB and TU strains mimics NA ZW and WW zebrafish, suggesting loss of the Z chromosome during domestication. Genetic analysis of the NA strain will facilitate our understanding of the evolution of sex determination mechanisms.\nHofbauer cells and fetal brain microglia share transcriptional profiles and responses to maternal diet-induced obesity\nAuthors: Batorsky, R.; Ceasrine, A. M.; Shook, L. L.; Kislal, S.; Bordt, E. A.; Devlin, B. A.; Perlis, R. H.; Slonim, D. K.; Bilbo, S. D.; Edlow, A. G.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.16.571680\nMaternal immune activation is associated with adverse offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes, many mediated by in utero microglial programming. As microglia remain inaccessible throughout development, identification of noninvasive biomarkers reflecting fetal brain microglial programming could permit screening and intervention. We used lineage tracing to demonstrate the shared ontogeny between fetal brain macrophages (microglia) and fetal placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells) in a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity, and single-cell RNA-seq to demonstrate shared transcriptional programs. Comparison with human datasets demonstrated conservation of placental resident macrophage signatures between mice and humans. Single-cell RNA-seq identified common alterations in fetal microglial and Hofbauer cell gene expression induced by maternal obesity, as well as sex differences in these alterations. We propose that Hofbauer cells, which are easily accessible at birth, provide novel insights into fetal brain microglial programs, and may facilitate the early identification of offspring vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders in the setting of maternal exposures.\nSystematic screens for fertility genes essential for malaria parasite transmission reveal conserved aspects of sex in a divergent eukaryote\nAuthors: Sayers, C.; Pandey, V.; Balakrishnana, A.; Michie, K.; Svedberg, D.; Hunziker, M.; Pardo, M.; Choudhary, J. S.; Berntsson, R. P.-A.; Billker, O.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-12-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.572958\nSexual reproduction in malaria parasites is essential for their transmission to mosquitoes. It also offers a divergent eukaryote model to understand the evolution of sex. Through a panel of genetic screens, where each sex of Plasmodium berghei was mutagenised separately with barcoded vectors, we identify 401 sex and transmission-related gene functions and define roles for hundreds of unstudied fertility genes as putative targets for transmission blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis and the axoneme. We identify a protein complex of a SUN domain protein, SUN1, and a moonlighting putative allantoicase, ALLC1, that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organising centre to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data point to an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in fertility. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission but also highlight ancestral aspects of sex that have evolved close to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\nPersistence of the primary somatosensory system in zebrafish\nAuthors: Navajas Acedo, J.\nScore: 51.3, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572352\nThe somatosensory system detects peripheral stimuli that are translated into behaviors necessary for survival. Fishes and amphibians possess two somatosensory systems in the trunk: the primary somatosensory system, formed by the Rohon-Beard neurons, and the secondary somatosensory system, formed by the neural crest cell-derived neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Visual systems provide a key interface between organisms and their surroundings, and have evolved in many forms to perform diverse functions across the animal kingdom. Spiders exhibit a range of visual abilities and ecologies, the diversity of which is underpinned by a highly versatile, modular visual system architecture. This typically includes eight eyes of two developmentally distinct types, but the number, size, location, and function of the eyes can vary dramatically between lineages. Previous studies of visual system development in spiders have confirmed that many components of the retinal determination gene (RDG) network are conserved in common with other arthropods, but so far, comparative studies among spiders are lacking. We characterised visual system development in eight species of spiders representing a range of morphologies, visual ecologies, and phylogenetic positions, to determine how these diverse configurations are formed, and how they might evolve. Combining synchrotron radiation tomography, transcriptomics, in situ hybridisation, and selection analyses, we describe the repertoires and expression of key RDGs in relation to adult morphology, and identify key molecular players, timepoints, and developmental events that may contribute to adult diversity. In particular, we discuss the molecular and developmental underpinnings of eye size, number, position, and identity across spiders, and highlight key areas for further functional analyses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system: the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Heart development involves the specification of distinct sets of cardiac progenitors at various times and locations during ontogeny. Here, we used live imaging in mice from the initiation of gastrulation to heart tube formation stages to investigate the origin and migratory paths of cardiac progenitors. We tracked individual mesodermal cells, reconstructing the lineage tree of the cells and fates for up to four generations. Our findings revealed independent unipotent progenitors originating at specific times that exclusively contribute to the left ventricle/atrioventricular canal (LV/AVC) or atrial myocytes. LV/AVC progeny differentiated into myocytes early, forming the cardiac crescent, while atrial progenitors differentiated later and contributed to the venous poles of the heart tube during morphogenesis. We also identified short-lived bipotent and tripotent mesodermal progenitors that contribute to a diverse array of mesodermal cell types, illustrating early plasticity during gastrulation. Sister cells generated by multipotent progenitors dispersed more and adopted more diverse migratory trajectories within the anterior mesoderm space than those from unipotent progenitors. Together the data reveal the regulation of individual cell directionality and cardiac fate allocation within the seemingly unorganised migratory pattern of mesoderm cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA replication in differentiated cells follows a defined program, but when and how it is established during mammalian development is not known. Here we show using single-cell sequencing, that both bovine and mouse cleavage stage embryos progress through S-phase in a defined pattern. Late replicating regions are associated with the nuclear lamina from the first cell cycle after fertilization, and contain few active origins, and few but long genes. Chromosome breaks, which form spontaneously in bovine embryos at sites concordant with human embryos, preferentially locate to late replicating regions. In mice, late replicating regions show enhanced fragility due to a sparsity of dormant origins that can be activated under conditions of replication stress. This pattern predisposes regions with long neuronal genes to fragility and genetic change prior to segregation of soma and germ line. Our studies show that the formation of early and late replicating regions is among the first layers of epigenetic regulation established on the mammalian genome after fertilization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The genetics of sex determination varies across taxa, sometimes even within a species. Major domesticated strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio), including AB and TU, lack a strong genetic sex determining locus, but strains more recently derived from nature, like Nadia (NA), possess a ZZ male/ZW female chromosomal sex-determination system. AB strain fish pass through a juvenile ovary stage, forming oocytes that survive in fish that become females but die in fish that become males. To understand mechanisms of gonad development in NA zebrafish, we studied histology and single cell transcriptomics in developing ZZ and ZW fish. ZW fish developed oocytes by 22 days post-fertilization (dpf) but ZZ fish directly formed testes, avoiding a juvenile ovary phase. Gonads of some ZW and WW fish, however, developed oocytes that died as the gonad became a testis, mimicking AB fish, suggesting that the gynogenetically derived AB strain is chromosomally WW. Single-cell RNA-seq of 19dpf gonads showed similar cell types in ZZ and ZW fish, including germ cells, precursors of gonadal support cells, steroidogenic cells, interstitial/stromal cells, and immune cells, consistent with a bipotential juvenile gonad. In contrast, scRNA-seq of 30dpf gonads revealed that cells in ZZ gonads had transcriptomes characteristic of testicular Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells while ZW gonads had granulosa cells, theca cells, and developing oocytes. Hematopoietic and vascular cells were similar in both sex genotypes. These results show that juvenile NA zebrafish initially develop a bipotential gonad; that a factor on the NA W chromosome or fewer than two Z chromosomes is essential to initiate oocyte development; and without the W factor or with two Z doses, NA gonads develop directly into testes without passing through the juvenile ovary stage. Sex determination in AB and TU strains mimics NA ZW and WW zebrafish, suggesting loss of the Z chromosome during domestication. Genetic analysis of the NA strain will facilitate our understanding of the evolution of sex determination mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Maternal immune activation is associated with adverse offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes, many mediated by in utero microglial programming. As microglia remain inaccessible throughout development, identification of noninvasive biomarkers reflecting fetal brain microglial programming could permit screening and intervention. We used lineage tracing to demonstrate the shared ontogeny between fetal brain macrophages (microglia) and fetal placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells) in a mouse model of maternal diet-induced obesity, and single-cell RNA-seq to demonstrate shared transcriptional programs. Comparison with human datasets demonstrated conservation of placental resident macrophage signatures between mice and humans. Single-cell RNA-seq identified common alterations in fetal microglial and Hofbauer cell gene expression induced by maternal obesity, as well as sex differences in these alterations. We propose that Hofbauer cells, which are easily accessible at birth, provide novel insights into fetal brain microglial programs, and may facilitate the early identification of offspring vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders in the setting of maternal exposures.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sexual reproduction in malaria parasites is essential for their transmission to mosquitoes. It also offers a divergent eukaryote model to understand the evolution of sex. Through a panel of genetic screens, where each sex of Plasmodium berghei was mutagenised separately with barcoded vectors, we identify 401 sex and transmission-related gene functions and define roles for hundreds of unstudied fertility genes as putative targets for transmission blocking interventions. The functional data provide a deeper understanding of female metabolic reprogramming, meiosis and the axoneme. We identify a protein complex of a SUN domain protein, SUN1, and a moonlighting putative allantoicase, ALLC1, that is essential for male fertility by linking the microtubule organising centre to the nuclear envelope and enabling mitotic spindle formation during male gametogenesis. Both proteins have orthologs in mouse testis, and the data point to an ancient role for atypical SUN domain proteins in fertility. Altogether, our data provide an unbiased picture of the molecular processes that underpin malaria parasite transmission but also highlight ancestral aspects of sex that have evolved close to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The somatosensory system detects peripheral stimuli that are translated into behaviors necessary for survival. Fishes and amphibians possess two somatosensory systems in the trunk: the primary somatosensory system, formed by the Rohon-Beard neurons, and the secondary somatosensory system, formed by the neural crest cell-derived neurons of the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Rohon-Beard neurons have been characterized as a transient population that mostly disappears during the first days of life and is functionally replaced by the Dorsal Root Ganglia. Here, I follow Rohon-Beard neurons in vivo and show that the entire repertoire remains present in zebrafish from 1-day post-fertilization until the juvenile stage, 15-days post-fertilization. These data indicate that zebrafish retain two complete somatosensory systems until at least up to a developmental stage when the animals display complex behavioral repertoires.</p>
