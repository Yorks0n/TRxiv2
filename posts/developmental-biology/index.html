Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.\nPax37 gene function in Oikopleura dioica supports a neuroepithelial-like origin for its house-making Fol territory\nAuthors: Lagman, D.; Leon, A.; Cieminska, N.; Deng, W.; Chatzigeorgiou, M.; Henriet, S.; Chourrout, D.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549157\nLarvacean tunicates feature a spectacular innovation not seen in other animals - the trunk oikoplastic epithelium (OE). This epithelium produces a house, a large and complex extracellular structure used for filtering and concentrating food particles. Previously we have shown that several homeobox transcription factors may play a role in patterning the OE. Among these are two Pax3/7 duplicates that we named Pax37A and Pax37B. The vertebrate homologs, PAX3 and PAX7, are involved in developmental processes related to neural crest and muscles. In the ascidian tunicate Ciona robusta, Pax3/7 has been given a role in development of cells deriving from the neural plate border including trunk epidermal sensory neurons and tail nerve cord neurons as well as in neural tube closure. Here we have investigated the roles of Pax37A and Pax37B in the development of the OE using CRISPR-Cas9, analyzing scRNA-seq data from wild-type animals that were compared with scRNA-seq data from C. robusta. We revealed that Pax37B but not Pax37A is essential for the differentiation of cell fields that produce the food concentrating filter of the house: the anterior Fol, giant Fol and Nasse cells. Lineage analysis supports that expression of Pax37 is under influence of Wnt signaling and that Fol cells have a neuroepithelial-like transcriptional signature. We propose that the highly specialized secretory epithelial cells of the Fol region either maintained or evolved neuroepithelial features as do \"glue\" secreting collocytes of ascidians. Their development seems to be controlled by a GRN that also operates in some ascidian neurons.\nGrowth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle\nAuthors: Yadav, A. S.; Hong, L.; Klees, P. M.; Kiss, A.; He, X.; Barrios, I. M.; Heeney, M.; Galang, A. M. D.; Smith, R. S.; Boudaoud, A.; Roeder, A. H. K.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.22.549953\nFrom smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.\nThe piRNA protein Asz1 is essential for germ cell and gonad development in in zebrafish and exhibits differential necessities in distinct types of RNP granules\nAuthors: Ahmad, A.; Bogoch, Y.; Shvaizer, G.; Elkouby, Y. M.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-07-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.18.549483\nGerm cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology. Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.\nERK signalling orchestrates metachronous transition from naive to formative pluripotency\nAuthors: Mulas, C.; Stammers, M.; Salomaa, S. I.; Heinzen, C.; Suter, D. M.; Smith, A.; Chalut, K. J.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-07-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549835\nNaive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.\nEstablishment of a novel non-integrated human pluripotent stem cell-based gastruloid model\nAuthors: Yuan, G.; Wang, J.; Liu, Z.; Chen, M.; Zhu, P.; Zhang, H.; Hu, Z.; Cui, Y.; Yuan, Y.; Sha, J.\nScore: 19.9, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546720\nEmbryo loss and pregnancy disorders are prevalent worldwide, with both conditions critically associated with dysfunctioning gastrulation processes. Gastrulation and post-gastrulation organogenesis are crucial stages of embryonic development that establish the blueprint for body part formation. These processes involve the sequential generation of three germ layer cells and primordial germ cells, as well as the assembly of the precursor tissues for body parts. However, due to ethical limitations associated with studying human embryogenesis, a more detailed understanding of gastrulation and post-gastrulation organogenesis remains elusive. To ensure that the knowledge obtained from gastruloids is biologically meaningful and clinically relevant, it is critical to create high-fidelity human embryo models that closely mimic embryogenesis in vivo. Here, we developed a two-stage derivation gastruloids in vitro based on human pluripotent stem cells. Morphological tracking mimicks the developmental processes of models from Carnegie Stage 4 (CS4) to early CS7. Our gastruloids exhibit key structures characteristic of human embryos, including amniotic cavity, embryonic disc, primitive streak, primary yolk sac, secondary yolk sac, and blood islets. Comparison of our cell lineage development maps showed that gastruloids closely resembled human natural CS7 gastrula. Our gastruloids exhibited transcriptional characteristics that mimicked the molecular pathways observed in natural embryos development. Importantly, we found that in our model, extraembryonic mesoderm originates from the yolk sac and primordial germ cells originate from the posterior epiblast of the embryonic disc. Moreover, we found that thalidomide affects the differentiation of three germ layer cells, resulting in the arrest of human gastruloid development. In conclusion, by establishing a human gastruloid, we were able to gain valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for human gastrulation and shed light on the causes of early embryo loss and pregnancy disorders.\nCoordination of cell cycle and morphogenesis during organ formation\nAuthors: Matthew, J.; Vishwakarma, V.; Le, T. P.; Agsunod, R. A.; Chung, S.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-07-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.20.549944\nOrgan formation requires precise regulation of cell cycle and morphogenetic events. Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The hkb mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas hkb mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of cyclin E or cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or overexpression of fizzy-related rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the hkb mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.\nAmphibian segmentation clock models suggest mechanisms of slowed development across increasing genome size and nuclear volume\nAuthors: Taylor, A. N.; Prasad, A.; Mueller, R. L.\nScore: 5.3, Published: 2023-07-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.16.549220\nEvolutionary increases in genome size, cell volume, and nuclear volume have been observed across the tree of life, with positive correlations documented between all three traits. Developmental tempo slows as genomes, nuclei, and cells increase in size, yet the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we use a mathematical model of the somitogenesis clock to link slowed developmental tempo with changes in intra-cellular gene expression kinetics induced by increasing genome size and nuclear volume. We adapt a well-known somitogenesis clock model to two model amphibian species that vary ten-fold in genome size: Xenopus laevis (3.2 Gb) and Ambystoma mexicanum (32 Gb). Based on simulations and backed by analytical derivations, we identify parameter changes originating from increased genome and nuclear size that slow gene expression kinetics. We simulate biological scenarios for which these parameter changes mathematically recapitulate slowed gene expression in A. mexicanum relative to X. laevis, and we consider scenarios for which additional alterations in gene product stability and chromatin packing are necessary. Results suggest that slowed degradation rates as well as changes induced by increasing nuclear volume, which remain relatively unexplored, are significant drivers of slowed developmental tempo.\nTissue tension permits β-catenin phosphorylation to drive mesoderm specification in human embryonic stem cells.\nAuthors: Ayad, N. M. E.; Lakins, J. N.; Ghagre, A.; Ehrlicher, A. J.; Weaver, V. M.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-07-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.549074\nThe role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.\nIntegrated single-cell multiomics uncovers foundational regulatory mechanisms of lens development and pathology\nAuthors: Tangeman, J. A.; Rebull, S. M.; Grajales-Esquivel, E.; Weaver, J. M.; Bendezu-Sayas, S.; Robinson, M. L.; Lachke, S. A.; Del Rio-Tsonis, K.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-07-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.10.548451\nOcular lens development entails epithelial to fiber cell differentiation, defects in which cause congenital cataract. We report the first single-cell multiomic atlas of lens development, leveraging snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and CUT\u0026RUN-seq to discover novel mechanisms of cell fate determination and cataract-linked regulatory networks. A comprehensive profile of cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, including for the cataract-linked transcription factor MAF, is established across a temporal trajectory of fiber cell differentiation. Further, we divulge a conserved epigenetic paradigm of cellular differentiation, defined by progressive loss of H3K27 methylation writer Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 localizes to heterochromatin domains across master-regulator transcription factor gene bodies, suggesting it safeguards epithelial cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that FGF hyper-stimulation in vivo leads to MAF network activation and the emergence of novel lens cell states. Collectively, these data depict a comprehensive portrait of lens fiber cell differentiation, while defining regulatory effectors of cell identity and cataract formation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cell migration is a fundamental process during embryonic development. Most studies on cell migration in vivo have focussed on the migration of cells using the extracellular matrix (ECM) as their substrate for migration. In contrast, much less is known about how cells migrate on other cells, as found in early embryos when the ECM has not yet formed. Here, we show that lateral mesendoderm (LME) cells in the early zebrafish gastrula use the overlying ectoderm as their substrate for migration. We show that the lateral ectoderm is permissive for the animal pole-directed migration of LME cells, while the ectoderm at the animal pole of the gastrula halts animal pole-directed LME migration. These differences in the permissive properties of the ectoderm for LME migration are due to the lateral ectoderm being more cohesive and viscous than the animal ectoderm. Consistently, tuning cell contractility in lateral and animal ectoderm via modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is sufficient to change their permissiveness for LME migration. Finally, we found that BMP signalling is critical for reducing animal ectoderm cohesion and, thus, its capacity to halt LME migration towards the animal pole. Collectively, these findings identify a critical role of ectoderm tissue cohesion and viscosity in guiding LME migration during zebrafish gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Larvacean tunicates feature a spectacular innovation not seen in other animals - the trunk oikoplastic epithelium (OE). This epithelium produces a house, a large and complex extracellular structure used for filtering and concentrating food particles. Previously we have shown that several homeobox transcription factors may play a role in patterning the OE. Among these are two Pax3/7 duplicates that we named Pax37A and Pax37B. The vertebrate homologs, PAX3 and PAX7, are involved in developmental processes related to neural crest and muscles. In the ascidian tunicate Ciona robusta, Pax3/7 has been given a role in development of cells deriving from the neural plate border including trunk epidermal sensory neurons and tail nerve cord neurons as well as in neural tube closure. Here we have investigated the roles of Pax37A and Pax37B in the development of the OE using CRISPR-Cas9, analyzing scRNA-seq data from wild-type animals that were compared with scRNA-seq data from C. robusta. We revealed that Pax37B but not Pax37A is essential for the differentiation of cell fields that produce the food concentrating filter of the house: the anterior Fol, giant Fol and Nasse cells. Lineage analysis supports that expression of Pax37 is under influence of Wnt signaling and that Fol cells have a neuroepithelial-like transcriptional signature. We propose that the highly specialized secretory epithelial cells of the Fol region either maintained or evolved neuroepithelial features as do &#34;glue&#34; secreting collocytes of ascidians. Their development seems to be controlled by a GRN that also operates in some ascidian neurons.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From smooth to buckled, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cellular growth patterns produce smooth organ shapes like those of leaves and sepals remains unclear. Here we show that unidirectional growth and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness. We identified a mutant with ectopic ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression that exhibits buckles on the outer epidermis due to conflicting growth directions and unequal epidermal stiffnesses. Aligning growth direction and increasing stiffness restores smoothness. Furthermore, buckling generates outgrowth by influencing auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 polarity, indicating buckling can initiate organogenesis. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germ cells are essential for fertility, embryogenesis, and reproduction. Germline development requires distinct types of RNA-protein (RNP) granules, including germ plasm in embryos, piRNA granules in gonadal germ cells, and the Balbiani body (Bb) in oocytes. However, the regulation of RNP assemblies in zebrafish germline development are still poorly understood. Asz1 is a piRNA protein in Drosophila and mice. Zebrafish Asz1 localizes to both piRNA and Bb granules, with yet unknown functions. Here, we hypothesized that Asz1 functions in RNP granule assemblies and germline development in zebrafish. We generated asz1 mutant fish to determine the roles of Asz1 in germ cell development. We show that Asz1 is dispensable for somatic development, but essential for germ cell and gonad development. asz1-/- fish developed exclusively as sterile males with severely underdeveloped testes that lacked germ cells, demonstrating that Asz1 is essential for spermatogenesis. Mechanistically, we provide evidence to conclude that zygotic Asz1 is not required for primordial germ cell specification or migration to the gonad, but is essential for germ cell survival during post-embryonic gonad development, likely by suppressing the expression of germline transposons. Increased transposon expression and morphologically mis-organized piRNA granules in asz1 mutants, argues that zebrafish Asz1 functions in the piRNA pathway. We generated asz1;tp53 fish to partially rescue ovarian development, revealing underdeveloped mutant ovaries with defective oocytes, and that Asz1 is also essential for oogenesis. We further showed that in contrast with piRNA granules, Asz1 is dispensable for Bb granule formation, as shown by normal Bb localization of Buc and dazl. By uncovering Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell survival and gonadogenesis in zebrafish, and determining its differential necessity in distinct RNP granule types, our work advances our understanding of the developmental genetics of reproduction and fertility, as well as of RNP granule biology.

Author SummaryGerm cells undergo a highly dynamic developmental program that begins in the early embryo and continues through juvenile and adult life. Identifying functional regulators and deciphering the developmental mechanisms of germ cells are critical for advancing our understanding of fertility and reproduction, as well as their associated diseases. Here, we identified Asz1 as an essential regulator of germ cell and gonad development in zebrafish. We demonstrate that zygotic Asz1 is dispensable for the specification and migration of primordial germ cells in the embryo, but is necessary for germ cell survival in the developing gonad, likely by protecting them from transposable elements. Upon loss of asz1, expression of germline transposons was induced, and piRNA granules were mis-organized, suggesting a conserved role for zebrafish Asz1 in the piRNA pathway. We show that Asz1 is required for both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, unlike RNA-protein (RNP) granules of the piRNA pathway, Asz1 was not required for RNP granules of the Balbiani body in differentiating oocytes, revealing its differential necessity in distinct types of germline RNP granules. In mice, Asz1 was shown to be essential for spermatogenesis but not oogenesis, but its functions in human gonads are unclear. Our work reports the functional requirements of Asz1 in both sexes in zebrafish, contributes to our knowledge of developmental reproduction biology, and sheds new light on the complexity of RNP granule assemblies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Naive epiblast cells in the embryo and pluripotent stem cells in vitro undergo developmental progression to a formative state competent for lineage specification. During this transition, transcription factors and chromatin are rewired to encode new functional features. Here, we examine the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signalling in pluripotent state transition. We show that a primary consequence of ERK activation in mouse embryonic stem cells is elimination of Nanog, precipitating breakdown of the naive state gene regulatory network. Cell variability in pERK dynamics results in metachronous down-regulation of Nanog and naive state exit. Knockdown of Nanog allows exit without ERK activation. However, transition to formative pluripotency does not proceed and cells collapse to an indeterminate identity. This failure is attributable to loss of expression of the central pluripotency factor Oct4. Thus, during formative transition ERK signalling both dismantles the naive state and preserves pluripotency. These results illustrate that a single signalling pathway can both drive exit from a developmental state and safeguard progression to the successor state.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Embryo loss and pregnancy disorders are prevalent worldwide, with both conditions critically associated with dysfunctioning gastrulation processes. Gastrulation and post-gastrulation organogenesis are crucial stages of embryonic development that establish the blueprint for body part formation. These processes involve the sequential generation of three germ layer cells and primordial germ cells, as well as the assembly of the precursor tissues for body parts. However, due to ethical limitations associated with studying human embryogenesis, a more detailed understanding of gastrulation and post-gastrulation organogenesis remains elusive. To ensure that the knowledge obtained from gastruloids is biologically meaningful and clinically relevant, it is critical to create high-fidelity human embryo models that closely mimic embryogenesis in vivo. Here, we developed a two-stage derivation gastruloids in vitro based on human pluripotent stem cells. Morphological tracking mimicks the developmental processes of models from Carnegie Stage 4 (CS4) to early CS7. Our gastruloids exhibit key structures characteristic of human embryos, including amniotic cavity, embryonic disc, primitive streak, primary yolk sac, secondary yolk sac, and blood islets. Comparison of our cell lineage development maps showed that gastruloids closely resembled human natural CS7 gastrula. Our gastruloids exhibited transcriptional characteristics that mimicked the molecular pathways observed in natural embryos development. Importantly, we found that in our model, extraembryonic mesoderm originates from the yolk sac and primordial germ cells originate from the posterior epiblast of the embryonic disc. Moreover, we found that thalidomide affects the differentiation of three germ layer cells, resulting in the arrest of human gastruloid development. In conclusion, by establishing a human gastruloid, we were able to gain valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for human gastrulation and shed light on the causes of early embryo loss and pregnancy disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organ formation requires precise regulation of cell cycle and morphogenetic events. Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we uncover the role of the SP1/KLF transcription factor Huckebein (Hkb) in coordinating cell cycle regulation and morphogenesis. The hkb mutant SG exhibits defects in invagination positioning and organ size due to abnormal death of SG cells. Normal SG development involves distal-to-proximal progression of endoreplication (endocycle), whereas hkb mutant SG cells undergo abnormal cell division, leading to cell death. Hkb represses the expression of key cell cycle and pro-apoptotic genes in the SG. Knockdown of cyclin E or cyclin-dependent kinase 1, or overexpression of fizzy-related rescues most of the morphogenetic defects observed in the hkb mutant SG. These results indicate that Hkb plays a critical role in controlling endoreplication by regulating the transcription of key cell cycle effectors to ensure proper organ formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evolutionary increases in genome size, cell volume, and nuclear volume have been observed across the tree of life, with positive correlations documented between all three traits. Developmental tempo slows as genomes, nuclei, and cells increase in size, yet the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we use a mathematical model of the somitogenesis clock to link slowed developmental tempo with changes in intra-cellular gene expression kinetics induced by increasing genome size and nuclear volume. We adapt a well-known somitogenesis clock model to two model amphibian species that vary ten-fold in genome size: Xenopus laevis (3.2 Gb) and Ambystoma mexicanum (32 Gb). Based on simulations and backed by analytical derivations, we identify parameter changes originating from increased genome and nuclear size that slow gene expression kinetics. We simulate biological scenarios for which these parameter changes mathematically recapitulate slowed gene expression in A. mexicanum relative to X. laevis, and we consider scenarios for which additional alterations in gene product stability and chromatin packing are necessary. Results suggest that slowed degradation rates as well as changes induced by increasing nuclear volume, which remain relatively unexplored, are significant drivers of slowed developmental tempo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The role of morphogenetic forces in cell fate specification is an area of intense interest. Our prior studies suggested that the development of high cell-cell tension in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) colonies permits the Src-mediated phosphorylation of junctional {beta}-catenin that accelerates its release to potentiate Wnt-dependent signaling critical for initiating mesoderm specification. Using an ectopically expressed nonphosphorylatable mutant of {beta}-catenin (Y654F), we now provide direct evidence that impeding tension-dependent Src-mediated {beta}-catenin phosphorylation impedes the expression of Brachyury (T) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for mesoderm specification. Addition of exogenous Wnt3a or inhibiting GSK3{beta} activity rescued mesoderm expression, emphasizing the importance of force dependent Wnt signaling in regulating mechanomorphogenesis. Our work provides a framework for understanding tension-dependent {beta}-catenin/Wnt signaling in the self-organization of tissues during developmental processes including gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ocular lens development entails epithelial to fiber cell differentiation, defects in which cause congenital cataract. We report the first single-cell multiomic atlas of lens development, leveraging snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and CUT&amp;RUN-seq to discover novel mechanisms of cell fate determination and cataract-linked regulatory networks. A comprehensive profile of cis- and trans-regulatory interactions, including for the cataract-linked transcription factor MAF, is established across a temporal trajectory of fiber cell differentiation. Further, we divulge a conserved epigenetic paradigm of cellular differentiation, defined by progressive loss of H3K27 methylation writer Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 localizes to heterochromatin domains across master-regulator transcription factor gene bodies, suggesting it safeguards epithelial cell fate. Moreover, we demonstrate that FGF hyper-stimulation in vivo leads to MAF network activation and the emergence of novel lens cell states. Collectively, these data depict a comprehensive portrait of lens fiber cell differentiation, while defining regulatory effectors of cell identity and cataract formation.</p>
