K.; Garge, R. K.; Regalado, S. G.; Nichols, E.; Lee, C.; Daza, R. M.; Srivatsan, S.; Shendure, J.\nScore: 43.4, Published: 2024-02-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.10.579769\nEmbryonic organoids are emerging as powerful models for studying early mammalian development. For example, stem cell-derived gastruloids form elongating structures containing all three germ layers1-4. However, although elongated, human gastruloids do not morphologically resemble post-implantation embryos. Here we show that a specific, discontinuous regimen of retinoic acid (RA) robustly induces human gastruloids with embryo-like morphological structures, including a neural tube and segmented somites. Single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) further reveals that these human RA-gastruloids contain more advanced cell types than conventional gastruloids, including neural crest cells, renal progenitor cells, skeletal muscle cells, and, rarely, neural progenitor cells. We apply a new approach to computationally stage human RA-gastruloids relative to somite-resolved mouse embryos, early human embryos and other gastruloid models, and find that the developmental stage of human RA-gastruloids is comparable to that of E9.5 mouse embryos, although some cell types show greater or lesser progression. We chemically perturb WNT and BMP signaling in human RA-gastruloids and find that these signaling pathways regulate somite patterning and neural tube length, respectively, while genetic perturbation of the transcription factors PAX3 and TBX6 markedly compromises the formation of neural crest and somites/renal cells, respectively. Human RA-gastruloids complement other embryonic organoids in serving as a simple, robust and screenable model for decoding early human embryogenesis.\nDecoding morphogen patterning of human neural organoids with a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomic screen\nAuthors: Sanchis-Calleja, F.; Jain, A.; He, Z.; Okamoto, R.; Rusimbi, C.; Rifes, P.; Rathore, G. S.; Santel, M.; Janssens, J.; Seimiya, M.; Fleck, J. S.; Kirkeby, A.; Camp, J. G.; Treutlein, B.\nScore: 39.9, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579413\nMorphogens, secreted signalling molecules that direct cell fate and tissue development, are used to direct neuroepithelial progenitors towards discrete regional identities across the central nervous system. Neural tissues derived from pluripotent stem cells in vitro (neural organoids) provide new models for studying neural regionalization, however, we lack a comprehensive survey of how the developing human neuroepithelium responds to morphogen cues. Here, we produce a detailed map of morphogen-induced effects on the axial and regional specification of human neural organoids using a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics screen. We find that the timing, concentration, and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell type and regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method strongly impact the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration gradients in microfluidic chips or a range of static concentrations in multi-well plates to explore how human neuroepithelium interprets morphogen concentrations and observe similar dose-dependent induction of patterned domains in both scenarios. Altogether, we provide a detailed resource that supports the development of new regionalized neural organoid protocols and enhances our understanding of human central nervous system patterning.\nLong-range chemical signalling in vivo is regulated by mechanical signals\nAuthors: Pillai, E. K.; Mukherjee, S.; Gampl, N.; McGinn, R. J.; Mooslehner, K. A.; Thompson, A. J.; Franze, K.\nScore: 21.8, Published: 2024-02-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.15.580459\nBiological processes are regulated by chemical signals (e.g., morphogens, growth factors, and guidance cues) and mechanical signals (e.g., tissue stiffness and cellular forces). Yet, the interaction between these two signals in vivo remains poorly understood. Using the developing Xenopus laevis brain as a model system, where growing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons are guided by both chemical and mechanical cues, we demonstrate that knockdown of the mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1, exerts cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects on axon pathfinding. Targeted Piezo1 knockdown in RGCs led to pathfinding errors in vivo. However, pathfinding errors were also observed in RGCs expressing Piezo1, when Piezo1 was downregulated in the surrounding brain tissue. Depleting Piezo1 levels led to both a decrease in the expression of the long-range chemical guidance cues, Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) and Slit1, and a decrease in tissue stiffness. While tissue softening was independent of Sema3A depletion, Slit1 and Sema3A expression increased significantly in stiffer environments in vitro. Moreover, stiffening soft brain regions in vivo induced ectopic production of Sema3A, via a Piezo1-dependent mechanism. Our results show that brain tissue mechanics modulates the expression of key chemical cues. This dynamic interplay between tissue mechanics and long-range chemical signalling likely extends across diverse biological systems throughout development, homeostasis, and disease.\nA tension-induced morphological transition shapes the avian extra-embryonic territory\nAuthors: Michaut, A.; Chamolly, A.; Villedieu, A.; Corson, F.; Gros, J.\nScore: 23.7, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579502\nThe segregation of the extra-embryonic lineage is one of the earliest events and a key step in amniote development. Whereas the regulation of extra-embryonic cell fate specification has been extensively studied, little is known about the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of this lineage. Here, taking advantage of the amenability of avian embryos to live and quantitative imaging, we investigate the cell- and tissue-scale dynamics of epiboly, the process during which the epiblast expands to engulf the entire yolk. We show that tension arising from the outward migration of the epiblast border on the vitelline membrane stretches extra-embryonic cells, which reversibly transition from a columnar to squamous morphology. The propagation of this tension is strongly attenuated in the embryonic territory, which concomitantly undergoes fluid-like motion, culminating in the formation of the primitive streak. We formulate a simple viscoelastic model in which the tissue responds elastically to isotropic stress but flows in response to shear stress, and show that it recapitulates the flows and deformation of both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Together, our results clarify the mechanical basis of early avian embryogenesis and provide a framework unifying the divergent mechanical behaviors observed in the contiguous embryonic and extra-embryonic territories that make up the epiblast. HighlightsO_LIThe extra-embryonic region expands radially during epiboly C_LIO_LICell area increase accounts for the rapid extra-embryonic expansion C_LIO_LIEpiboly-induced tension reversibly stretches extra-embryonic cells C_LIO_LIA simple viscoelastic model recovers the morphogenesis of the entire epiblast C_LI\nDifferential tissue deformability underlies shape divergence of the embryonic brain and spinal cord under fluid pressure\nAuthors: McLaren, S. B. P.; Xue, S.-L.; Ding, S.; Winkel, A.; Baldwin, O.; Dwarakacherla, S.; Franze, K.; Hannezo, E.; Xiong, F.\nScore: 27.7, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575349\nAn expanded brain enables the complex behaviours of vertebrates that promote their adaptation in diverse ecological niches1-3. Initial morphological differences between the brain and spinal cord emerge as the antero-posteriorly patterned neural plate folds to form the neural tube4-7 during embryonic development. Following neural tube closure, a dramatic expansion of the brain diverges its shape from the spinal cord8, setting their distinct morphologies for further development9,10. How the brain and the spinal cord expand differentially remains unclear. Here, using the chicken embryo as a model, we show that the hindbrain expands through dorsal tissue thinning under a positive hydrostatic pressure from the neural tube lumen11,12 while the dorsal spinal cord shape resists the same pressure. Using magnetic droplets and atomic force microscopy, we reveal that the dorsal tissue in the hindbrain is more fluid than in the spinal cord. The dorsal hindbrain harbours more migratory neural crest cells13 and exhibits reduced apical actin and a disorganised laminin matrix compared to the dorsal spinal cord. Blocking the activity of neural crest-associated matrix metalloproteinases inhibited dorsal tissue thinning, leading to abnormal brain morphology. Transplanting early dorsal hindbrain cells to the spinal cord was sufficient to create a region with expanded brain-like morphology including a thinned-out roof. Our findings open new questions in vertebrate head evolution and neural tube defects, and suggest a general role of mechanical pre-pattern in creating shape differences in epithelial tubes.\nA paternal cardiac lesion induces cardiac adaptation in offspring\nAuthors: Coppe, B.; Galardi-Castilla, M.; Sanz-Morejon, A.; Arora, P.; Lucas, J.; Lalaguna, L.; Lara Pezzi, E.; Flores, I.; Mercader, N.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2024-02-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.09.579452\nBackgroundFollowing cardiac injury, whether the heart is permanently damaged or regenerating, distal organs are subjected to changes in physiological function. It remains largely unknown whether a cardiac lesion can affect gametes and transmit heritable changes to subsequent generations. Here, we report the influence of paternal cardiac injury on the following generation. MethodsWe studied the intergenerational influence of neonatal cardiac injury in the mouse, an animal model capable of regenerating the heart after early life injury. Neonatal male mice were subjected to ventricular cryoinjury, crossed at adulthood, and their sires were compared with litters derived from uninjured male mice. We used echocardiography, histology, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize cardiac morphology, composition, function, and response to cardiac insult. ResultsWe show that paternal cardiac injury affects the heart morphology of offspring under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in response to the same injury, the F1 generation derived from injured fathers shows better systemic and cardiac recovery, with non-pathological left ventricular enlargement and improved cardiac function during the regenerative process. This is accompanied by the activation of the immune system healing program at 3 weeks post-injury, together with enhanced transcription of genes associated with physiological hypertrophy. ConclusionsThe memory of a paternal neonatal lesion can be transmitted to offspring and improve their recovery from a cardiac insult.\nLocal and global changes in cell density induce reorganisation of 3D packing in a proliferating epithelium.\nAuthors: Barone, V.; Tagua, A.; Andres-San Roman, J. A.; Hamdoun, A.; Garrido-Garcia, J.; Lyons, D.; Escudero, L. M.\nScore: 26.9, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579268\nTissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named \"scutoid\" that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development. Summary statementThe study uses sea star embryogenesis as a model of a proliferating epithelium to highlight how cell division induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.\nModularity of the segmentation clock and morphogenesis\nAuthors: Hammond, J. E.; Baker, R. E.; Verd, B.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2024-02-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574679\nVertebrates have evolved great diversity in the number of segments dividing the trunk body, however the developmental origin of the evolvability of this trait is poorly understood. The number of segments is thought to be determined in embryogenesis as a product of morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and the periodicity of a molecular oscillator active within the PSM known as the segmentation clock. Here we explore whether the clock and PSM morphogenesis exhibit developmental modularity, as independent evolution of these two processes may explain the high evolvability of segment number. Using a computational model of the clock and PSM parameterised for zebrafish, we find that the clock is broadly robust to variation in morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression, motility, compaction, and cell division. We show that this robustness is in part determined by the length of the PSM and the strength of phase coupling in the clock. As previous studies report no changes to morphogenesis upon perturbing the clock, we suggest that the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM exhibit developmental modularity.\nProgressive cell fate specification in morphallactic regeneration\nAuthors: Nuninger, C.; Papasaikas, P.; Ferralli, J.; Smallwood, S.; Tsiairis, C. D.\nScore: 8.6, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579449\nThrough regeneration various species replace lost parts of their body. This is achieved either by growth of new structures at the amputation side (epimorphosis), as is the case of axolotl limb regeneration, or through remodeling of the remaining tissue (morphallaxis), as happens in Hydra. Whereas work on epimorphic regeneration support a gradual proximal to distal establishment of cell identities, morphallactic regeneration is believed to rely on initial establishment of boundary conditions that organize the re-adjustment of the pattern. Performing single cell RNA sequencing during regeneration in Hydra, we revealed the sequence of cells transdifferentiation into the missing identities. We provide evidence that morphallaxis proceeds with progressive specification of cell fates, unifying its mechanism with the one found for epimorphosis.\nEph/ephrin signalling in the developing brain is regulated by tissue stiffness\nAuthors: Sipkova, J.; Franze, K.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2024-02-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.15.580461\nEph receptors and their membrane-bound ligands, ephrins, provide key signals in many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell motility and cell sorting at tissue boundaries. However, despite immense progress in our understanding of Eph/ephrin signalling, there are still discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo work, and the regulation of Eph/ephrin signalling remains incompletely understood. Since a major difference between in vivo and most in vitro experiments is the stiffness of the cellular environment, we here investigated the interplay between tissue mechanics and Eph/ephrin signalling using the Xenopus laevis optic pathway as a model system. Xenopus retinal neurons cultured on soft substrates mechanically resembling brain tissue showed the opposite response to ephrinB1 compared to those cultured on glass. In vivo atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based stiffness mapping revealed that the visual area of the Xenopus brain, the optic tectum, becomes mechanically heterogeneous during its innervation by axons of retinal neurons. The resulting stiffness gradient correlated with both a cell density gradient and expression patterns of EphB and ephrinB family members. Exposing ex vivo brains to stiffer matrices or locally stiffening the optic tectum in vivo led to an increase in EphB2 expression in the optic tectum, indicating that tissue mechanics is an important regulator of Eph/ephrin signalling. Similar mechanisms are likely to be involved in the development and diseases of many other organ systems.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Embryonic organoids are emerging as powerful models for studying early mammalian development. For example, stem cell-derived  gastruloids form elongating structures containing all three germ layers1-4. However, although elongated, human gastruloids do not morphologically resemble post-implantation embryos. Here we show that a specific, discontinuous regimen of retinoic acid (RA) robustly induces human gastruloids with embryo-like morphological structures, including a neural tube and segmented somites. Single cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) further reveals that these human  RA-gastruloids contain more advanced cell types than conventional gastruloids, including neural crest cells, renal progenitor cells, skeletal muscle cells, and, rarely, neural progenitor cells. We apply a new approach to computationally stage human RA-gastruloids relative to somite-resolved mouse embryos, early human embryos and other gastruloid models, and find that the developmental stage of human RA-gastruloids is comparable to that of E9.5 mouse embryos, although some cell types show greater or lesser progression. We chemically perturb WNT and BMP signaling in human RA-gastruloids and find that these signaling pathways regulate somite patterning and neural tube length, respectively, while genetic perturbation of the transcription factors PAX3 and TBX6 markedly compromises the formation of neural crest and somites/renal cells, respectively. Human RA-gastruloids complement other embryonic organoids in serving as a simple, robust and screenable model for decoding early human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogens, secreted signalling molecules that direct cell fate and tissue development, are used to direct neuroepithelial progenitors towards discrete regional identities across the central nervous system. Neural tissues derived from pluripotent stem cells in vitro (neural organoids) provide new models for studying neural regionalization, however, we lack a comprehensive survey of how the developing human neuroepithelium responds to morphogen cues. Here, we produce a detailed map of morphogen-induced effects on the axial and regional specification of human neural organoids using a multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics screen. We find that the timing, concentration, and combination of morphogens strongly influence organoid cell type and regional composition, and that cell line and neural induction method strongly impact the response to a given morphogen condition. We apply concentration gradients in microfluidic chips or a range of static concentrations in multi-well plates to explore how human neuroepithelium interprets morphogen concentrations and observe similar dose-dependent induction of patterned domains in both scenarios. Altogether, we provide a detailed resource that supports the development of new regionalized neural organoid protocols and enhances our understanding of human central nervous system patterning.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological processes are regulated by chemical signals (e.g., morphogens, growth factors, and guidance cues) and mechanical signals (e.g., tissue stiffness and cellular forces). Yet, the interaction between these two signals in vivo remains poorly understood. Using the developing Xenopus laevis brain as a model system, where growing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons are guided by both chemical and mechanical cues, we demonstrate that knockdown of the mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1, exerts cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic effects on axon pathfinding. Targeted Piezo1 knockdown in RGCs led to pathfinding errors in vivo. However, pathfinding errors were also observed in RGCs expressing Piezo1, when Piezo1 was downregulated in the surrounding brain tissue. Depleting Piezo1 levels led to both a decrease in the expression of the long-range chemical guidance cues, Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) and Slit1, and a decrease in tissue stiffness. While tissue softening was independent of Sema3A depletion, Slit1 and Sema3A expression increased significantly in stiffer environments in vitro. Moreover, stiffening soft brain regions in vivo induced ectopic production of Sema3A, via a Piezo1-dependent mechanism. Our results show that brain tissue mechanics modulates the expression of key chemical cues. This dynamic interplay between tissue mechanics and long-range chemical signalling likely extends across diverse biological systems throughout development, homeostasis, and disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The segregation of the extra-embryonic lineage is one of the earliest events and a key step in amniote development. Whereas the regulation of extra-embryonic cell fate specification has been extensively studied, little is known about the morphogenetic events underlying the formation of this lineage. Here, taking advantage of the amenability of avian embryos to live and quantitative imaging, we investigate the cell- and tissue-scale dynamics of epiboly, the process during which the epiblast expands to engulf the entire yolk. We show that tension arising from the outward migration of the epiblast border on the vitelline membrane stretches extra-embryonic cells, which reversibly transition from a columnar to squamous morphology. The propagation of this tension is strongly attenuated in the embryonic territory, which concomitantly undergoes fluid-like motion, culminating in the formation of the primitive streak. We formulate a simple viscoelastic model in which the tissue responds elastically to isotropic stress but flows in response to shear stress, and show that it recapitulates the flows and deformation of both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. Together, our results clarify the mechanical basis of early avian embryogenesis and provide a framework unifying the divergent mechanical behaviors observed in the contiguous embryonic and extra-embryonic territories that make up the epiblast.

HighlightsO_LIThe extra-embryonic region expands radially during epiboly
C_LIO_LICell area increase accounts for the rapid extra-embryonic expansion
C_LIO_LIEpiboly-induced tension reversibly stretches extra-embryonic cells
C_LIO_LIA simple viscoelastic model recovers the morphogenesis of the entire epiblast

        <p class="abstract">An expanded brain enables the complex behaviours of vertebrates that promote their adaptation in diverse ecological niches1-3. Initial morphological differences between the brain and spinal cord emerge as the antero-posteriorly patterned neural plate folds to form the neural tube4-7 during embryonic development. Following neural tube closure, a dramatic expansion of the brain diverges its shape from the spinal cord8, setting their distinct morphologies for further development9,10. How the brain and the spinal cord expand differentially remains unclear. Here, using the chicken embryo as a model, we show that the hindbrain expands through dorsal tissue thinning under a positive hydrostatic pressure from the neural tube lumen11,12 while the dorsal spinal cord shape resists the same pressure. Using magnetic droplets and atomic force microscopy, we reveal that the dorsal tissue in the hindbrain is more fluid than in the spinal cord. The dorsal hindbrain harbours more migratory neural crest cells13 and exhibits reduced apical actin and a disorganised laminin matrix compared to the dorsal spinal cord. Blocking the activity of neural crest-associated matrix metalloproteinases inhibited dorsal tissue thinning, leading to abnormal brain morphology. Transplanting early dorsal hindbrain cells to the spinal cord was sufficient to create a region with expanded brain-like morphology including a thinned-out roof. Our findings open new questions in vertebrate head evolution and neural tube defects, and suggest a general role of mechanical pre-pattern in creating shape differences in epithelial tubes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundFollowing cardiac injury, whether the heart is permanently damaged or regenerating, distal organs are subjected to changes in physiological function. It remains largely unknown whether a cardiac lesion can affect gametes and transmit heritable changes to subsequent generations. Here, we report the influence of paternal cardiac injury on the following generation.

MethodsWe studied the intergenerational influence of neonatal cardiac injury in the mouse, an animal model capable of regenerating the heart after early life injury. Neonatal male mice were subjected to ventricular cryoinjury, crossed at adulthood, and their sires were compared with litters derived from uninjured male mice. We used echocardiography, histology, and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to thoroughly characterize cardiac morphology, composition, function, and response to cardiac insult.

ResultsWe show that paternal cardiac injury affects the heart morphology of offspring under physiological conditions. Furthermore, in response to the same injury, the F1 generation derived from injured fathers shows better systemic and cardiac recovery, with non-pathological left ventricular enlargement and improved cardiac function during the regenerative process. This is accompanied by the activation of the immune system healing program at 3 weeks post-injury, together with enhanced transcription of genes associated with physiological hypertrophy.

ConclusionsThe memory of a paternal neonatal lesion can be transmitted to offspring and improve their recovery from a cardiac insult.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named &#34;scutoid&#34; that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.

Summary statementThe study uses sea star embryogenesis as a model of a proliferating epithelium to highlight how cell division induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Vertebrates have evolved great diversity in the number of segments dividing the trunk body, however the developmental origin of the evolvability of this trait is poorly understood. The number of segments is thought to be determined in embryogenesis as a product of morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and the periodicity of a molecular oscillator active within the PSM known as the segmentation clock. Here we explore whether the clock and PSM morphogenesis exhibit developmental modularity, as independent evolution of these two processes may explain the high evolvability of segment number. Using a computational model of the clock and PSM parameterised for zebrafish, we find that the clock is broadly robust to variation in morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression, motility, compaction, and cell division. We show that this robustness is in part determined by the length of the PSM and the strength of phase coupling in the clock. As previous studies report no changes to morphogenesis upon perturbing the clock, we suggest that the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM exhibit developmental modularity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Through regeneration various species replace lost parts of their body. This is achieved either by growth of new structures at the amputation side (epimorphosis), as is the case of axolotl limb regeneration, or through remodeling of the remaining tissue (morphallaxis), as happens in Hydra. Whereas work on epimorphic regeneration support a gradual proximal to distal establishment of cell identities, morphallactic regeneration is believed to rely on initial establishment of boundary conditions that organize the re-adjustment of the pattern. Performing single cell RNA sequencing during regeneration in Hydra, we revealed the sequence of cells transdifferentiation into the missing identities. We provide evidence that morphallaxis proceeds with progressive specification of cell fates, unifying its mechanism with the one found for epimorphosis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eph receptors and their membrane-bound ligands, ephrins, provide key signals in many biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell motility and cell sorting at tissue boundaries. However, despite immense progress in our understanding of Eph/ephrin signalling, there are still discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo work, and the regulation of Eph/ephrin signalling remains incompletely understood. Since a major difference between in vivo and most in vitro experiments is the stiffness of the cellular environment, we here investigated the interplay between tissue mechanics and Eph/ephrin signalling using the Xenopus laevis optic pathway as a model system. Xenopus retinal neurons cultured on soft substrates mechanically resembling brain tissue showed the opposite response to ephrinB1 compared to those cultured on glass. In vivo atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based stiffness mapping revealed that the visual area of the Xenopus brain, the optic tectum, becomes mechanically heterogeneous during its innervation by axons of retinal neurons. The resulting stiffness gradient correlated with both a cell density gradient and expression patterns of EphB and ephrinB family members. Exposing ex vivo brains to stiffer matrices or locally stiffening the optic tectum in vivo led to an increase in EphB2 expression in the optic tectum, indicating that tissue mechanics is an important regulator of Eph/ephrin signalling. Similar mechanisms are likely to be involved in the development and diseases of many other organ systems.</p>
