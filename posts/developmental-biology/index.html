However, sporadic reports of dividing cells have raised questions about this assumption. In this study, we investigated whether tardigrades truly exhibit a fixed cell number during somatic growth using the model species Hypsibius exemplaris. Comparing hatchlings to adults, we observed an overall increase in the number of storage cells, a tardigrade cell type involved in nutrient storage. To assess cell proliferation, we monitored DNA replication via the incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU). A significantly higher number of storage cells incorporated EdU while animals were still growing. Starvation halted both animal growth and storage cell proliferation, linking the two processes. Additionally, we found that EdU incorporation in storage cells is associated with molting, a critical process in tardigrade post-embryonic development, since it involves cuticle renewal to enable further growth. Finally, we show that hydroxyurea, a drug that slows down DNA replication progression, strongly reduces the number of EdU+ cells and results in molting-related fatalities. Our data not only provide a comprehensive picture of replication events during tardigrade growth but also highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. This study definitively challenges the notion of eutely in tardigrades, offering promising avenues for exploring cell cycle, replication stress, and DNA damage management in these remarkable creatures as genetic manipulation techniques emerge within the tardigrade research field. SIGNIFICANCETardigrades, microscopic invertebrate animals renowned for their resilience in extreme conditions, have traditionally been considered eutelic, implying little to no somatic cell proliferation during their growth. However, a few isolated reports challenged this notion. In this study, using the emerging model Hypsibius exemplaris, we provide unequivocal molecular evidence of DNA replication and proliferation in a specific tardigrade cell type called storage cells, primarily involved in nutrient storage, throughout the animals growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this proliferation is associated with the timing of cuticle molting, and we highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. Our research definitively resolves the long-standing controversy surrounding tardigrade eutely, opening up uncharted territories in tardigrade research.\nCapitella teleta gets left out: Possible evolutionary shift causes loss of left tissues rather than increased neural tissue from dominant-negative BMPR1\nAuthors: Webster, N. B.; Meyer, N. P.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560756\nBackgroundThe evolution of centralized nervous systems (CNSs) a fascinating and complex topic; further work is needed to understand the genetic and developmental homology between organisms with a CNS. Research into a limited number of species suggests that CNSs may be homologous across Bilateria. This hypothesis is based in part on similar functions of BMP signaling in establishing fates along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis including limiting neural specification to one region of ectoderm. From an evolutionary-developmental perspective, the best way to understand a system is to explore it in a wide range of organisms to create a full picture. MethodsHere we expand our understanding of BMP signaling in Spiralia, the third major clade of bilaterians, by examining phenotypes after expression of a dominant-negative BMP Receptor 1 and after knock-out of the putative BMP antagonist Chordin-like using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the annelid Capitella teleta (Pleistoannelida). ResultsEctopic expression of the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 did not increase CNS tissue or alter overall D-V axis formation in the trunk. Instead, we observed a unique asymmetric phenotype: a distinct loss of left tissues including the left eye, brain, foregut, and trunk mesoderm. Adding ectopic BMP4 early during cleavage stages reversed the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 phenotype, leading to a similar loss or reduction of right tissues instead. Surprisingly, a similar asymmetric loss of left tissues was evident from CRISPR knock-out of Cte-Chordin-like but concentrated in the trunk rather than the episphere. ConclusionsWe further solidify the hypothesis that the function of BMP signaling during establishment of the D-V axis and CNS is fundamentally different in at least Pleistoannelida, possibly in Spiralia, and is not required for nervous system delimitation in this group. Our results support hypotheses of either multiple evolutionary origins of CNSs across Bilateria or divergence in the molecular mechanisms of CNS specification and D-V axis formation in annelids.\nTwo distinct waves of transcriptome and translatome remodelling drive germline stem cell differentiation\nAuthors: Samuels, T. J.; Gui, J.; Gebert, D.; Karam Teixeira, F.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-10-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.05.14.540555\nDevelopment and tissue maintenance require a supply of new cells, which are generated by division of stem cells and then specialised to perform their function. The differentiation process requires the tight control of gene expression, but this has been challenging to study in a systematic manner in adult stem cells, which are sparsely distributed in tissues. We have overcome these limitations by establishing a robust protocol to synchronise Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation in vivo, allowing us to perform transcriptome and translatome analyses at high temporal resolution during differentiation. As well as observing dynamic changes in mRNA level, promoter usage and exon inclusion, our data reveal that changing translation efficiency is the predominant regulatory mechanism during GSC differentiation. Indeed, changes in mRNA level are frequently buffered by changes in translation efficiency, including the translational repression of transcripts that will only be translated later during oocyte maturation or embryo development. Contrary to the expected linear accumulation of changes from stem cell to differentiated cell, our data reveal that differentiation occurs through two distinct waves of changes in both the transcriptome and translatome level.\nDisrupted endosomal trafficking of the Vangl-Celsr polarity complex causes congenital anomalies in trachea-esophageal separation\nAuthors: Edwards, N. A.; Kashyap, A.; Warren, A.; Agricola, Z.; Kenny, A. P.; Shen, Y.; Chung, W. K.; Zorn, A. M.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-10-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561909\nThe developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.\nCut it out: Out-of-plane stresses in cell sheet folding of Volvox embryos\nAuthors: Haas, P. A.; Hoehn, S. S. M. H.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.17.562736\nThe folding of cellular monolayers pervades embryonic development and disease. It results from stresses out of the plane of the tissue, often caused by cell shape changes including cell wedging via apical constriction. These local cellular changes need not however be compatible with the global shape of the tissue. Such geometric incompatibilities lead to residual stresses that have out-of-plane components in curved tissues, but the mechanics and function of these out-of-plane stresses are poorly understood, perhaps because their quantification has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this difficulty by combining laser ablation experiments and a mechanical model to reveal that such out-of-plane residual stresses exist and also persist during the inversion of the spherical embryos of the green alga Volvox. We show how to quantify the mechanical properties of the curved tissue from its unfurling on ablation, and reproduce the tissue shape sequence at different developmental timepoints quantitatively by our mechanical model. Strikingly, this reveals not only clear mechanical signatures of out-of-plane stresses associated with cell shape changes away from those regions where cell wedging bends the tissue, but also indicates an adaptive response of the tissue to these stresses. Our results thus suggest that cell sheet folding is guided mechanically not only by cell wedging, but also by out-of-plane stresses from these additional cell shape changes.\nNutritional sex-specificity during larval development in mosquitoes\nAuthors: Romoli, O.; Serrato-Salas, J.; Gapp, C.; Figueras Ivern, P.; Gendrin, M.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562973\nMosquitoes rely on their microbiota for B vitamin provision. We previously found that Aedes aegypti larvae cleared of their microbiota at the beginning of the third instar were impaired in their development and that folic acid supplementation increased the proportion of larvae reaching the adult stage. In this study, we investigated the effects of other B vitamins on the development of germ-free mosquito larvae. We found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex- ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin- treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of B vitamin treated male and female larvae identified few genes that may be involved in specific vitamin-induced mechanisms. The treatment of germ-free larvae with high doses of individual B vitamin solutions identified a specific toxic effect related to biotin exposure at high concentrations. The supplementation of germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses revealed divergent biotin requirements and toxic effects for male and female Ae. aegypti larvae. These findings shed new light on sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds during the development of insect larvae, and on their consequences on the sex ratio of adults.\nA distinct subpopulation of adipocytes in adult perirenal adipose tissue arises through brown-to-white conversion but reverts to a thermogenic phenotype upon cold exposure\nAuthors: Zhang, H.; Li, Y.; Ibanez, C. F.; Xie, M.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561821\nPerirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1-/Cidea+ adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes.\nMacrophage differentiation requires DNA damage caused by Caspase-Activated DNase\nAuthors: Maurya, D.; Rai, G.; Mandal, D.; Mondal, B. C.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.562503\nPhagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to self-renew lifelong. However, the mechanisms for macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Using in vivo genetic analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, we show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling triggers apoptotic signaling and causes DNA breaks during macrophage development. However, the same Akt signaling attenuates Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1) to control apoptotic and JNK activity in differentiating macrophages. DNA-damaged differentiating cells display autophagy activity as a survival strategy. Furthermore, caspase activity is required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. This study reveals a previously unknown relationship between developmental signals and caspase-activated DNA breaks necessary for multifunctional macrophage differentiation.\nTemporal restriction of RNAi reveals breakdown of the segmentation clock is reversible after knock down of primary pair rule genes but not Wnt-signaling in the red flour beetle\nAuthors: Kaufholz, F.; Ulrich, J. C.; Hakeemi, M. S.; Bucher, G.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.15.562380\nAnimals from all major clades have evolved a segmented trunk, reflected for instance in the repetitive organization of the human spine or the insect segments. These units emerge during embryonic segmentation from a posterior segment addition zone, where repetitive gene activity is regulated in a spatiotemporal dynamic described by the clock and wavefront/speed gradient model. This model has been tested in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and other insects by studying the effect of the RNAi knockdown of segmentation genes. For upstream components such as primary pair rule genes, caudal or Wnt pathway components, this treatment often led to the breakdown of segmentation. However, it has remained untested, how the system would react to a temporally limited interruption of gene function. In order to ask such questions, we established a novel experimental system in T. castaneum, which allows blocking an ongoing RNAi effect with temporal control by expressing a viral inhibitor of RNAi. We show that the T. castaneum segmentation machinery re-established after we blocked an ongoing RNAi response targeting the primary pair rule genes Tc-eve, Tc-odd and Tc-runt. However, we observed no rescue after blocking RNAi responses targeting Wnt pathway components. We conclude that the insect segmentation system contains both, robust feedback-loops that can re-establish and labile feedback loops that can breakdown irreversibly. This combination may reconcile two partially conflicting needs of the embryonic regulation of segmentation: A tightly controlled initiation and maintenance of the SAZ by labile feedback-loops ensures that only one segment addition zone is formed. Conversely, robust feedback-loops confer developmental robustness required for proper segmentation, which may be challenged by internal or external disturbances. Our results ponder the insect segmentation machinery from a different angle and introduce a new experimental tool for temporal control on RNAi. Significance statementThe generation of repetitive body parts during embryonic segmentation has been of key interest to developmental biologists, who usually used permanent knock-down of gene function for their studies. Using a new tool to temporally stop a gene knock-down effect, we find both robust and labile feedback-loops within the segmentation machinery. Thereby, the embryo may ensure that only one trunk is formed but that trunk formation is robust against external disturbance.\nThe embryonic role of juvenile hormone in the firebrat, Thermobia domestica, reveals its function before its involvement in metamorphosis\nAuthors: Truman, J. W.; M. Riddiford, L.; Konopova, B.; Nouzova, M.; Noriega, F.; Herko, M.\nScore: 2.7, Published: 2023-10-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561279\nJuvenile hormone (JH) is a key regulator of insect metamorphosis. To understand its role before metamorphosis originated, we studied JH action in the ametabolous firebrat, Thermobia domestica. JH levels peak late in embryogenesis and are low through early juvenile stages. Chemical suppression of embryonic JH synthesis by 7-ethoxyprecocene blocks embryonic differentiation, but the latter is restored with exogenous JH. Premature exposure of younger embryos to JH suppresses growth and morphogenesis and the expression of morphogens, such as myoglianin. These embryos switch to premature differentiation as shown by muscle formation and synthesis of cuticle like that of later embryonic stages. We hypothesize that this ancestral role of JH in supporting tissue differentiation was later exploited for the evolution of metamorphosis. In embryos, the temporal separation of morphogen signaling and JH secretion results in morphogenesis preceding differentiation. With the evolution of metamorphosis, embryonic morphogen systems were redeployed during juvenile growth for morphogenesis of imaginal primordia. JH was also redeployed, but it now occurred with morphogen signaling. This co-occurrence resulted in JH maintaining a juvenile quality to the bud, which the morphogens positive allometric growth. The disappearance of JH late in growth then allowed the unantagonized morphogens to drive the primordia into metamorphosis.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tardigrades, microscopic ecdysozoans renowned for their resilience to extreme environments, have long been thought to maintain a constant cell number after completing embryonic development, a phenomenon known as eutely. However, sporadic reports of dividing cells have raised questions about this assumption. In this study, we investigated whether tardigrades truly exhibit a fixed cell number during somatic growth using the model species Hypsibius exemplaris. Comparing hatchlings to adults, we observed an overall increase in the number of storage cells, a tardigrade cell type involved in nutrient storage. To assess cell proliferation, we monitored DNA replication via the incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU). A significantly higher number of storage cells incorporated EdU while animals were still growing. Starvation halted both animal growth and storage cell proliferation, linking the two processes. Additionally, we found that EdU incorporation in storage cells is associated with molting, a critical process in tardigrade post-embryonic development, since it involves cuticle renewal to enable further growth. Finally, we show that hydroxyurea, a drug that slows down DNA replication progression, strongly reduces the number of EdU&#43; cells and results in molting-related fatalities. Our data not only provide a comprehensive picture of replication events during tardigrade growth but also highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. This study definitively challenges the notion of eutely in tardigrades, offering promising avenues for exploring cell cycle, replication stress, and DNA damage management in these remarkable creatures as genetic manipulation techniques emerge within the tardigrade research field.

SIGNIFICANCETardigrades, microscopic invertebrate animals renowned for their resilience in extreme conditions, have traditionally been considered eutelic, implying little to no somatic cell proliferation during their growth. However, a few isolated reports challenged this notion. In this study, using the emerging model Hypsibius exemplaris, we provide unequivocal molecular evidence of DNA replication and proliferation in a specific tardigrade cell type called  storage cells, primarily involved in nutrient storage, throughout the animals growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this proliferation is associated with the timing of cuticle molting, and we highlight the critical role of proper DNA replication in tardigrade molting and survival. Our research definitively resolves the long-standing controversy surrounding tardigrade eutely, opening up uncharted territories in tardigrade research.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe evolution of centralized nervous systems (CNSs) a fascinating and complex topic; further work is needed to understand the genetic and developmental homology between organisms with a CNS. Research into a limited number of species suggests that CNSs may be homologous across Bilateria. This hypothesis is based in part on similar functions of BMP signaling in establishing fates along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis including limiting neural specification to one region of ectoderm. From an evolutionary-developmental perspective, the best way to understand a system is to explore it in a wide range of organisms to create a full picture.

MethodsHere we expand our understanding of BMP signaling in Spiralia, the third major clade of bilaterians, by examining phenotypes after expression of a dominant-negative BMP Receptor 1 and after knock-out of the putative BMP antagonist Chordin-like using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the annelid Capitella teleta (Pleistoannelida).

ResultsEctopic expression of the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 did not increase CNS tissue or alter overall D-V axis formation in the trunk. Instead, we observed a unique asymmetric phenotype: a distinct loss of left tissues including the left eye, brain, foregut, and trunk mesoderm. Adding ectopic BMP4 early during cleavage stages reversed the dominant-negative Cte-BMPR1 phenotype, leading to a similar loss or reduction of right tissues instead. Surprisingly, a similar asymmetric loss of left tissues was evident from CRISPR knock-out of Cte-Chordin-like but concentrated in the trunk rather than the episphere.

ConclusionsWe further solidify the hypothesis that the function of BMP signaling during establishment of the D-V axis and CNS is fundamentally different in at least Pleistoannelida, possibly in Spiralia, and is not required for nervous system delimitation in this group. Our results support hypotheses of either multiple evolutionary origins of CNSs across Bilateria or divergence in the molecular mechanisms of CNS specification and D-V axis formation in annelids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Development and tissue maintenance require a supply of new cells, which are generated by division of stem cells and then specialised to perform their function. The differentiation process requires the tight control of gene expression, but this has been challenging to study in a systematic manner in adult stem cells, which are sparsely distributed in tissues. We have overcome these limitations by establishing a robust protocol to synchronise Drosophila female germline stem cell (GSC) differentiation in vivo, allowing us to perform transcriptome and translatome analyses at high temporal resolution during differentiation. As well as observing dynamic changes in mRNA level, promoter usage and exon inclusion, our data reveal that changing translation efficiency is the predominant regulatory mechanism during GSC differentiation. Indeed, changes in mRNA level are frequently buffered by changes in translation efficiency, including the translational repression of transcripts that will only be translated later during oocyte maturation or embryo development. Contrary to the expected linear accumulation of changes from stem cell to differentiated cell, our data reveal that differentiation occurs through two distinct waves of changes in both the transcriptome and translatome level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The developmental basis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistulas (EA/TEF), life-threatening congenital anomalies where the embryonic foregut fails to properly separate into trachea and esophagus, is poorly understood. Recent genome sequencing reveals that de novo variants in intracellular trafficking genes are enriched in EA/TEF patients, suggesting that these cellular processes regulate foregut morphogenesis. Here we show that mutation of orthologous genes in Xenopus disrupts trachea-esophageal separation like EA/TEF patients. We identify the underlying mechanism showing that the Rab11a recycling endosome pathway is required to localize Vangl-Celsr polarity complexes at the apical cell surface where opposite sides of the foregut tube fuses forming a transient epithelial bilayer. A partial loss of endosome trafficking or knockdown of the Vangl/Celsr complex disrupts cell polarity and planar cell division. Mutant cells accumulate in the disorganize septum, fail to downregulate cadherin, and do not separate into distinct trachea and esophagus. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of congenital anomalies and general paradigms of tissue fusion during organogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The folding of cellular monolayers pervades embryonic development and disease. It results from stresses out of the plane of the tissue, often caused by cell shape changes including cell wedging via apical constriction. These local cellular changes need not however be compatible with the global shape of the tissue. Such geometric incompatibilities lead to residual stresses that have out-of-plane components in curved tissues, but the mechanics and function of these out-of-plane stresses are poorly understood, perhaps because their quantification has proved challenging. Here, we overcome this difficulty by combining laser ablation experiments and a mechanical model to reveal that such out-of-plane residual stresses exist and also persist during the inversion of the spherical embryos of the green alga Volvox. We show how to quantify the mechanical properties of the curved tissue from its unfurling on ablation, and reproduce the tissue shape sequence at different developmental timepoints quantitatively by our mechanical model. Strikingly, this reveals not only clear mechanical signatures of out-of-plane stresses associated with cell shape changes away from those regions where cell wedging bends the tissue, but also indicates an adaptive response of the tissue to these stresses. Our results thus suggest that cell sheet folding is guided mechanically not only by cell wedging, but also by out-of-plane stresses from these additional cell shape changes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mosquitoes rely on their microbiota for B vitamin provision. We previously found that Aedes aegypti larvae cleared of their microbiota at the beginning of the third instar were impaired in their development and that folic acid supplementation increased the proportion of larvae reaching the adult stage. In this study, we investigated the effects of other B vitamins on the development of germ-free mosquito larvae. We found that diet supplementation using a cocktail of seven B vitamins did not improve mosquito developmental success, but rather had a significant impact on the sex- ratio of the resulting adults, with an enrichment of female mosquitoes emerging from B vitamin- treated larvae. A transcriptomic analysis of B vitamin treated male and female larvae identified few genes that may be involved in specific vitamin-induced mechanisms. The treatment of germ-free larvae with high doses of individual B vitamin solutions identified a specific toxic effect related to biotin exposure at high concentrations. The supplementation of germ-free larvae with varying biotin doses revealed divergent biotin requirements and toxic effects for male and female Ae. aegypti larvae. These findings shed new light on sex-specific nutritional requirements and toxicity thresholds during the development of insect larvae, and on their consequences on the sex ratio of adults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is a unique visceral depot that contains a mixture of brown and white adipocytes. The origin and plasticity of such cellular heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we combine single-nucleus RNA sequencing with genetic lineage tracing to reveal the existence of a distinct subpopulation of Ucp1-/Cidea&#43; adipocytes that arises from brown-to-white conversion during postnatal life in the peri-ureter region of mouse PRAT. Cold exposure restores Ucp1 expression and a thermogenic phenotype in this subpopulation. These cells have a transcriptome that is distinct from subcutaneous beige adipocytes and may represent a unique type of cold-recruitable adipocytes. These results pave the way for studies of PRAT physiology and mechanisms controlling the plasticity of brown/white adipocyte phenotypes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Phagocytic macrophages are crucial for innate immunity and tissue homeostasis. Most macrophages develop from embryonic precursors that populate every organ before birth to self-renew lifelong. However, the mechanisms for macrophage differentiation remain unknown. Using in vivo genetic analysis of the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, we show that the developmentally regulated transient activation of Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD)-mediated DNA breaks in intermediate progenitors is essential for macrophage differentiation. Insulin receptor-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling triggers apoptotic signaling and causes DNA breaks during macrophage development. However, the same Akt signaling attenuates Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1) to control apoptotic and JNK activity in differentiating macrophages. DNA-damaged differentiating cells display autophagy activity as a survival strategy. Furthermore, caspase activity is required for embryonic-origin macrophage development and efficient phagocytosis. This study reveals a previously unknown relationship between developmental signals and caspase-activated DNA breaks necessary for multifunctional macrophage differentiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals from all major clades have evolved a segmented trunk, reflected for instance in the repetitive organization of the human spine or the insect segments. These units emerge during embryonic segmentation from a posterior segment addition zone, where repetitive gene activity is regulated in a spatiotemporal dynamic described by the clock and wavefront/speed gradient model. This model has been tested in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and other insects by studying the effect of the RNAi knockdown of segmentation genes. For upstream components such as primary pair rule genes, caudal or Wnt pathway components, this treatment often led to the breakdown of segmentation. However, it has remained untested, how the system would react to a temporally limited interruption of gene function. In order to ask such questions, we established a novel experimental system in T. castaneum, which allows blocking an ongoing RNAi effect with temporal control by expressing a viral inhibitor of RNAi. We show that the T. castaneum segmentation machinery re-established after we blocked an ongoing RNAi response targeting the primary pair rule genes Tc-eve, Tc-odd and Tc-runt. However, we observed no rescue after blocking RNAi responses targeting Wnt pathway components. We conclude that the insect segmentation system contains both, robust feedback-loops that can re-establish and labile feedback loops that can breakdown irreversibly. This combination may reconcile two partially conflicting needs of the embryonic regulation of segmentation: A tightly controlled initiation and maintenance of the SAZ by labile feedback-loops ensures that only one segment addition zone is formed. Conversely, robust feedback-loops confer developmental robustness required for proper segmentation, which may be challenged by internal or external disturbances. Our results ponder the insect segmentation machinery from a different angle and introduce a new experimental tool for temporal control on RNAi.

Significance statementThe generation of repetitive body parts during embryonic segmentation has been of key interest to developmental biologists, who usually used permanent knock-down of gene function for their studies. Using a new tool to temporally stop a gene knock-down effect, we find both robust and labile feedback-loops within the segmentation machinery. Thereby, the embryo may ensure that only one trunk is formed but that trunk formation is robust against external disturbance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Juvenile hormone (JH) is a key regulator of insect metamorphosis. To understand its role before metamorphosis originated, we studied JH action in the ametabolous firebrat, Thermobia domestica. JH levels peak late in embryogenesis and are low through early juvenile stages. Chemical suppression of embryonic JH synthesis by 7-ethoxyprecocene blocks embryonic differentiation, but the latter is restored with exogenous JH. Premature exposure of younger embryos to JH suppresses growth and morphogenesis and the expression of morphogens, such as myoglianin. These embryos switch to premature differentiation as shown by muscle formation and synthesis of cuticle like that of later embryonic stages.

We hypothesize that this ancestral role of JH in supporting tissue differentiation was later exploited for the evolution of metamorphosis. In embryos, the temporal separation of morphogen signaling and JH secretion results in morphogenesis preceding differentiation. With the evolution of metamorphosis, embryonic morphogen systems were redeployed during juvenile growth for morphogenesis of imaginal primordia. JH was also redeployed, but it now occurred with morphogen signaling. This co-occurrence resulted in JH maintaining a juvenile quality to the bud, which the morphogens positive allometric growth. The disappearance of JH late in growth then allowed the unantagonized morphogens to drive the primordia into metamorphosis.</p>
