M.\nScore: 60.7, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564423\nUpon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.\nPatterned embryonic invagination evolved in response to mechanical instability\nAuthors: Vellutini, B. C.; Cuenca, M. B.; Krishna, A.; Sza≈Çapak, A.; Modes, C. D.; Tomancak, P.\nScore: 44.4, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534554\nMechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.\nSOX2+ sustentacular cells are stem cells of the postnatal adrenal medulla\nAuthors: Santambrogio, A.; Kemkem, Y.; Willis, T.

L.\nScore: 20.6, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.564519\nRenewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2+ cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2+ cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.\nBiosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part, by altered miRNA cargo from conceptus-derived extracellular vesicles.\nAuthors: De Bem, T.

G.; Arantes Ataide, G.; da Silva, J. C. B.; Fumie Watanabe, Y.; Gonella-Diaza, A.; da Silveira, J.

We transferred Bos taurus taurus embryos of different origin: In vivo (high developmental potential (IV)), in vitro (intermediate developmental potential (IVF)), or cloned (low developmental potential (NT)), into Bos taurus indicus recipients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) recovered from Day 16 conceptus conditioned medium were characterized and their microRNA (miRNA) cargo sequenced alongside RNA sequencing of their respective endometria. There were substantial differences in the endometrial response to in vivo Vs in vitro and in vivo Vs cloned conceptuses (1153 and 334DEGs respectively) with limited differences between in vitro Vs cloned conceptuses (36 DEGs). miRNA cargo was similar between all three groups (426 common cargo) differences between in vivo and cloned (8 miRNAs), and in vivo and in vitro (6 miRNAs) observed. Treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with mimic or inhibitors for miR-128 and miR-1298 changes to the proteomic content of target cells (96, and 85 respectively) of which mRNAs are altered in the endometrium in vivo (PLXDC2, COPG1, HSPA12A, MCM5, TBL1XR1, and TTF). In conclusion, we have determined that the biosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part, by its response to different EVs miRNA cargo produced by the conceptus during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy.\nDivergent evolutionary strategies preempt tissue collision in fly gastrulation\nAuthors: Dey, B.; Kaul, V.; Kale, G.; Scorcelletti, M.; Takeda, M.; Wang, Y.-C.; Lemke, S.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561568\nMetazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.\nTransposable elements acquire time- and sex-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures along mouse fetal gonad development\nAuthors: Stevant, I.; Gonen, N.; Poulat, F.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563600\nGonadal sex determination in mice is a complex and dynamic process, crucial for the development of functional reproductive organs. The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.\nIntegrated Proteomics Identifies Troponin I Isoform Switch as a Regulator of a Sarcomere-Metabolism Axis During Cardiac Regeneration\nAuthors: Aballo, T. J.; Bae, J.; Paltzer, W. G.; Chapman, E. A.; Salamon, R. J.; Mann, M. M.; Ge, Y.; Mahmoud, A. I.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563389\nAdult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.\nOverexpression of mitochondrial fusion genes enhances resilience and extends longevity\nAuthors: Traa, A.; Keil, A.; Rudich, Z.; Zhu, S.; Van Raamsdonk, J.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-10-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.24.563703\nThe dynamicity of the mitochondrial network is crucial for meeting the ever-changing metabolic and energy needs of the cell. Mitochondrial fission promotes the degradation and distribution of mitochondria, while mitochondrial fusion maintains mitochondrial function through the complementation of mitochondrial components. Previously, we have reported that mitochondrial networks are tubular, interconnected and well-organized in young, healthy C. elegans, but become fragmented and disorganized with advancing age and in models of age-associated neurodegenerative disease. In this work, we examine the effects of increasing mitochondrial fission or mitochondrial fusion capacity by ubiquitously overexpressing the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 or the mitochondrial fusion genes fzo-1 and eat-3, individually or in combination. We then measured mitochondrial function, mitochondrial network morphology, physiologic rates, stress resistance and lifespan. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of either mitochondrial fission or fusion machinery both resulted in an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Similarly, both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion overexpression strains have extended lifespans and increased stress resistance, which appears to be at least partially due to the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways in these strains. Overall, our work demonstrates that increasing the expression of mitochondrial fission or fusion genes extends lifespan and improves biological resilience without promoting the maintenance of a youthful mitochondrial network morphology. This work highlights the importance of the mitochondria for both resilience and longevity. IMPORTANTO_LIManuscripts submitted to Review Commons are peer reviewed in a journal-agnostic way.

Further, it is used as a flame retardant and plasticizer in the fabric and electronics industry. Further, TBP is used to extract uranium, plutonium, and thorium. Thus, widespread uses of TBP in industrialized countries led to the release of TBP and its metabolites, dibutyl phosphate (DBP) and monobutyl phosphate (MBP), in the environment, including air, soil, and water, and get detected in human samples. Accumulating these OPEs over time in humans and other animals may develop toxicological effects. The reports also say OPEs contaminants pass through the mother-fetal transmission route and may affect embryonic development. However, the impact of TBP and its metabolites on vertebrate development has been poorly studied. Ex-Utero development, short generation time, high fecundity, optical transparency, and genetic and physiological similarity to humans make the zebrafish a preferred model for studying vertebrate development, organogenesis, small molecule screening, toxicological evaluation, etc. Thus, we aim to explore the toxic effects of TBP, DBP, and MBP on vertebrate organogenesis and overall embryonic development using zebrafish as a model organism. Our study found that TBP inhibits neural growth resulting in decreased spontaneous movements frequency at 22 and 28 hpf without altering the somite and overall embryonic growth in lower doses. In contrast, in lower concentrations, DBP-treated embryos showed normal neuronal and embryonic development and increased spontaneous movement frequency at 22 and 28 hpf. Further, we found that in higher concentrations, TBP is teratogenic, DBP is lethal to the embryos, and MBP did not show detectable toxic effects in the developing embryos. Altogether, we found that TBP inhibits neurogenesis, and its metabolite DBP is neuroexcitatory during embryonic development.\nA geometrical model of cell fate specification in the mouse blastocyst\nAuthors: Raju, A.; Siggia, E.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563683\nThe lineage decision that generates the epiblast and primitive endoderm from the inner cell mass (ICM) is a paradigm for cell fate specification. Recent mathematics has formalized Waddingtons landscape metaphor and proven that lineage decisions in detailed gene network models must conform to a small list of low dimensional stereotypic changes called bifurcations. The most plausible bifurcation for the ICM is the so-called heteroclinic flip that we define and elaborate here. Our reanalysis of recent data suggests that there is sufficient cell movement in the ICM so the FGF signal, which drives the lineage decision, can be treated as spatially uniform. We thus extend the bifurcation model for a single cell to the entire ICM by means of a self-consistently defined time-dependent FGF signal. This model is consistent with available data and we propose additional dynamic experiments to test it further. This demonstrates that simplified, quantitative, and intuitively transparent descriptions are possible when attention is shifted from specific genes to lineages. The flip bifurcation is a very plausible model for any situation where the embryo needs control over the relative proportions of two fates by a morphogen feedback.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Upon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Renewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2&#43; cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2&#43; stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2&#43; cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We tested the hypothesis that the biosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part, by the effect of different cargo contained in the extracellular vesicles secreted by the conceptus during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. We transferred Bos taurus taurus embryos of different origin: In vivo (high developmental potential (IV)), in vitro (intermediate developmental potential (IVF)), or cloned (low developmental potential (NT)), into Bos taurus indicus recipients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) recovered from Day 16 conceptus conditioned medium were characterized and their microRNA (miRNA) cargo sequenced alongside RNA sequencing of their respective endometria. There were substantial differences in the endometrial response to in vivo Vs in vitro and in vivo Vs cloned conceptuses (1153 and 334DEGs respectively) with limited differences between in vitro Vs cloned conceptuses (36 DEGs). miRNA cargo was similar between all three groups (426 common cargo) differences between in vivo and cloned (8 miRNAs), and in vivo and in vitro (6 miRNAs) observed. Treatment of endometrial epithelial cells with mimic or inhibitors for miR-128 and miR-1298 changes to the proteomic content of target cells (96, and 85 respectively) of which mRNAs are altered in the endometrium in vivo (PLXDC2, COPG1, HSPA12A, MCM5, TBL1XR1, and TTF). In conclusion, we have determined that the biosensor capability of the endometrium is mediated in part, by its response to different EVs miRNA cargo produced by the conceptus during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gonadal sex determination in mice is a complex and dynamic process, crucial for the development of functional reproductive organs. The expression of genes involved in this process is regulated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Recently, there has been increasing evidence that transposable elements (TEs), which are a class of mobile genetic elements, play a significant role in regulating gene expression during embryogenesis and organ development. In this study, we aimed to investigate the involvement of TEs in the regulation of gene expression during mouse embryonic gonadal development. Through bioinformatic analysis, we aimed to identify and characterize specific TEs acting as regulatory elements for sex-specific genes, as well as their potential mechanisms of regulation. We identified TE loci expressed in a time- and sex-specific manner along fetal gonad development that correlate positively and negatively with nearby gene expression, suggesting that their expression is integrated to the gonadal regulatory network. Moreover, chromatin accessibility and histone post-transcriptional modification analyses in the differentiating supporting cells revealed that TEs are acquiring sex-specific signature for promoter-, enhancer-, and silencer-like elements with some of them being proximal to critical sex determining genes. Altogether, our study introduces TEs as new potential players of the gene regulatory network controlling gonadal development in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The dynamicity of the mitochondrial network is crucial for meeting the ever-changing metabolic and energy needs of the cell. Mitochondrial fission promotes the degradation and distribution of mitochondria, while mitochondrial fusion maintains mitochondrial function through the complementation of mitochondrial components. Previously, we have reported that mitochondrial networks are tubular, interconnected and well-organized in young, healthy C. elegans, but become fragmented and disorganized with advancing age and in models of age-associated neurodegenerative disease. In this work, we examine the effects of increasing mitochondrial fission or mitochondrial fusion capacity by ubiquitously overexpressing the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 or the mitochondrial fusion genes fzo-1 and eat-3, individually or in combination. We then measured mitochondrial function, mitochondrial network morphology, physiologic rates, stress resistance and lifespan. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of either mitochondrial fission or fusion machinery both resulted in an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Similarly, both mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fusion overexpression strains have extended lifespans and increased stress resistance, which appears to be at least partially due to the upregulation of multiple stress response pathways in these strains. Overall, our work demonstrates that increasing the expression of mitochondrial fission or fusion genes extends lifespan and improves biological resilience without promoting the maintenance of a youthful mitochondrial network morphology. This work highlights the importance of the mitochondria for both resilience and longevity.

        <p class="abstract">Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), an organophosphate ester (OPE), is heavily used as a solvent in synthetic resins, inks, and adhesives and as an antifoaming agent in detergents and emulsion products. Further, it is used as a flame retardant and plasticizer in the fabric and electronics industry. Further, TBP is used to extract uranium, plutonium, and thorium. Thus, widespread uses of TBP in industrialized countries led to the release of TBP and its metabolites, dibutyl phosphate (DBP) and monobutyl phosphate (MBP), in the environment, including air, soil, and water, and get detected in human samples. Accumulating these OPEs over time in humans and other animals may develop toxicological effects. The reports also say OPEs contaminants pass through the mother-fetal transmission route and may affect embryonic development. However, the impact of TBP and its metabolites on vertebrate development has been poorly studied. Ex-Utero development, short generation time, high fecundity, optical transparency, and genetic and physiological similarity to humans make the zebrafish a preferred model for studying vertebrate development, organogenesis, small molecule screening, toxicological evaluation, etc. Thus, we aim to explore the toxic effects of TBP, DBP, and MBP on vertebrate organogenesis and overall embryonic development using zebrafish as a model organism. Our study found that TBP inhibits neural growth resulting in decreased spontaneous movements frequency at 22 and 28 hpf without altering the somite and overall embryonic growth in lower doses. In contrast, in lower concentrations, DBP-treated embryos showed normal neuronal and embryonic development and increased spontaneous movement frequency at 22 and 28 hpf. Further, we found that in higher concentrations, TBP is teratogenic, DBP is lethal to the embryos, and MBP did not show detectable toxic effects in the developing embryos. Altogether, we found that TBP inhibits neurogenesis, and its metabolite DBP is neuroexcitatory during embryonic development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The lineage decision that generates the epiblast and primitive endoderm from the inner cell mass (ICM) is a paradigm for cell fate specification. Recent mathematics has formalized Waddingtons landscape metaphor and proven that lineage decisions in detailed gene network models must conform to a small list of low dimensional stereotypic changes called bifurcations. The most plausible bifurcation for the ICM is the so-called heteroclinic flip that we define and elaborate here. Our reanalysis of recent data suggests that there is sufficient cell movement in the ICM so the FGF signal, which drives the lineage decision, can be treated as spatially uniform. We thus extend the bifurcation model for a single cell to the entire ICM by means of a self-consistently defined time-dependent FGF signal. This model is consistent with available data and we propose additional dynamic experiments to test it further. This demonstrates that simplified, quantitative, and intuitively transparent descriptions are possible when attention is shifted from specific genes to lineages. The flip bifurcation is a very plausible model for any situation where the embryo needs control over the relative proportions of two fates by a morphogen feedback.</p>
