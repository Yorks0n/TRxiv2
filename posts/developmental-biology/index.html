M.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2024-02-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.08.579268\nTissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named 'scutoid' that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.\nSuppression of ERK signalling promotes pluripotent epiblast in the human blastocyst\nAuthors: Simon, C.

M.; Niakan, K. K.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578414\nStudies in the mouse demonstrate the importance of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and extra-cellular receptor tyrosine kinase (ERK) in specification of embryo-fated epiblast and yolk-sac-fated hypoblast cells from uncommitted inner cell mass (ICM) cells prior to implantation. Molecular mechanisms regulating specification of early lineages in human development are comparatively unclear. Here we show that exogenous FGF stimulation leads to expanded hypoblast molecular marker expression, at the expense of the epiblast. Conversely, we show that specifically inhibiting ERK activity leads to expansion of epiblast cells functionally capable of giving rise to naive human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicates that these epiblast cells downregulate FGF signalling and upregulate molecular markers associated with naive pluripotency. Our functional study demonstrates for the first time the molecular mechanisms governing ICM specification in human development, whereby segregation of the epiblast and hypoblast lineages occurs during maturation of the mammalian embryo in an ERK signal-dependent manner.\nA TBX5-dependent compartment boundary patterns the cardiac interventricular septum\nAuthors: Kathiriya, I. S.; Dominguez, M. H.; Rao, K. S.; Muncie-Vasic, J. M.; Devine, W. P.; Hu, K. M.; Hota, S. K.; Garay, B. I.; Quintero, D.; Goyal, P.; Matthews, M. N.; Thomas, R.; Sukonnik, T.; Miguel-Perez, D.; Winchester, S.; Brower, E. F.; Forjaz, A.; Wu, P.-H.; Wirtz, D.; Kiemen, A. L.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 15.4, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578995\nFailure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.\nThe Guinea Pig: A New Model for Human Preimplantation Development\nAuthors: Canizo, J. R.; Zhao, C.; Petropoulos, S.\nScore: 15.0, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578945\nPreimplantation development is an important window of human embryogenesis. During this time, the initial lineages are formed which largely govern embryo competence, implantation, and ultimately the developmental potential of the fetus. Ethical constraints and limitations surrounding human embryos research often necessitates the use of a model system. We now identify the guinea pig as a promising small animal model, which closely recapitulates early human embryogenesis in terms of the timing of compaction, early-, mid-, and late-blastocyst formation and implantation. We also observe conserved spatio-temporal expression of key lineage markers, roles of both Hippo and MEK-ERK signaling and an incomplete X-Chromosome inactivation. Further, our multi-species analysis highlights the spatio-temporal expression of conserved and divergent genes during preimplantation development. The guinea pig serves as an exciting new model which will enhance developmental and pluripotency research and can be leveraged to better understand the longer term impact of early exposures on offspring outcomes.\nA Comprehensive Human Embryogenesis Reference Tool using Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data\nAuthors: Zhao, C.; Plaza Reyes, A.; Schell, J.

The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.\nHost response during unresolved urinary tract infection alters mammary tissue homeostasis through collagen deposition and TIMP1\nAuthors: Henry, S.; Lewis, S.

Here, we explored how the systemic host-response to bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) induces tissue-specific alterations to the mammary gland. Utilizing a combination of histological tissue analysis, single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we identified that mammary tissue from UTI-bearing mice display collagen deposition, enlarged ductal structures, ductal hyperplasia with atypical epithelial transcriptomes and altered immune composition. Bacterial cells were absent in the mammary tissue and blood of UTI-bearing mice, therefore, alterations to the distal mammary tissue were mediated by the systemic host response to local infection. Furthermore, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment resolved the infection and restored mammary cellular and tissue homeostasis. Systemically, unresolved UTI correlated with increased plasma levels of the metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP1, which controls extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neutrophil function. Treatment of nulliparous and post-lactation UTI-bearing female mice with a TIMP1 neutralizing antibody, or broad-spectrum antibiotic, prevented mammary collagen deposition, thus providing evidence for an unexpected link between the systemic host response during UTI and mammary alterations. SummaryThe systemic response during urinary tract infection induces TIMP1-driven collagen deposition specifically into the mammary gland.\nA spatiotemporally resolved atlas of mRNA decay in the C. elegans embryo reveals differential regulation of mRNA stability across stages and cell types\nAuthors: Peng, F.; Nordgren, C. E.; Murray, J. I.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575757\nDuring embryonic development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell fate specification. Although both transcription and mRNA degradation contribute to gene expression dynamics, patterns of mRNA decay are less well-understood. Here we directly measured spatiotemporally resolved mRNA decay rates transcriptome-wide throughout C. elegans embryogenesis by transcription inhibition followed by bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing. This allowed us to calculate mRNA half-lives within specific cell types and developmental stages and identify differentially regulated mRNA decay throughout embryonic development. We identified transcript features that are correlated with mRNA stability and found that mRNA decay rates are associated with distinct peaks in gene expression over time. Moreover, we provide evidence that, on average, mRNA is more stable in the germline compared to in the soma and in later embryonic stages compared to in earlier stages. This work suggests that differential mRNA decay across cell states and time helps to shape developmental gene expression, and it provides a valuable resource for studies of mRNA turnover regulatory mechanisms.\nSox9 links biliary maturation to branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Hrncir, H. R.; Bombin, S.; Goodloe, B.; Hogan, C. B.; Jadi, O.; Gracz, A. D.\nScore: 21.2, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.574730\nBranching morphogenesis couples cellular differentiation with development of tissue architecture. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) morphogenesis is initiated with biliary epithelial cell (BEC) specification and eventually forms a heterogeneous network of large ducts and small ductules. Here, we show that Sox9 is required for developmental establishment of small ductules. IHBDs emerge as a webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, manifesting as loss of ductules in adult livers. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-{beta} signaling and Activin A. Activin A induces developmental gene expression and morphological defects in BEC organoids and represses ductule formation in postnatal livers. Our data demonstrate that adult IHBD morphology and BEC maturation is regulated by the Sox9-dependent formation of precursors to ductules during development, mediated in part by downregulation of Activin A.\nThe deubiquitylating enzyme Fat Facets modulates Fat signalling and regulates tissue growth\nAuthors: Dawson, L. E.; Fulford, A. D.; Sekar, A.; Ribeiro, P. S.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.27.577535\nRegulation of tissue growth is influenced by many signals, including polarity cues. The Hippo signalling pathway restricts tissue growth and receives inputs from the planar cell polarity-controlling Fat signalling pathway. The atypical cadherin Fat restricts growth via several mechanisms that ultimately control the activity of the pro-growth transcriptional activator Yorkie. Fat signalling modulates the activity of the Yorkie inhibitory kinase Warts, as well as the function of the FERM protein Expanded, which promotes Hippo signalling and also directly inhibits Yorkie. Although several Fat pathway activity modulators are known to be involved in ubiquitylation, the role of this post-translational modification in the pathway remains unclear. Moreover, no deubiquitylating enzymes have been described in this pathway. Here, using an in vivo RNAi screening approach, we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme Fat facets as a regulator of Fat signalling that is important for tissue growth regulation. Fat facets interacts genetically and physically with Fat signalling components and regulates transcription of Yorkie target genes. Thus, we uncover a role for reversible ubiquitylation in the strict control of Fat signalling and, by extension, in the regulation of tissue growth.\nHepatoblast iterative apicobasal polarization is regulated by extracellular matrix remodeling\nAuthors: Delpierre, J.; Valenzuela, J. I.; Bovyn, M.; Martins, N. P.; Belicova, L.; Repnik, U.; Bebelman, M.; Seifert, S.; Haas, P. A.; Kalaidzidis, Y. L.; Zerial, M.\nScore: 14.4, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578046\nHepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Tissue morphogenesis is intimately linked to the changes in shape and organisation of individual cells. In curved epithelia, cells can intercalate along their own apicobasal axes adopting a shape named &#39;scutoid&#39; that allows energy minimization in the tissue. Although several geometric and biophysical factors have been associated with this 3D reorganisation, the dynamic changes underlying scutoid formation in 3D epithelial packing remain poorly understood. Here we use live-imaging of the sea star embryo coupled with deep learning-based segmentation, to dissect the relative contributions of cell density, tissue compaction, and cell proliferation on epithelial architecture. We find that tissue compaction, which naturally occurs in the embryo, is necessary for the appearance of scutoids. Physical compression experiments identify cell density as the factor promoting scutoid formation at a global level. Finally, the comparison of the developing embryo with computational models indicates that the increase in the proportion of scutoids is directly associated with cell divisions. Our results suggest that apico-basal intercalations appearing just after mitosis may help accommodate the new cells within the tissue. We propose that proliferation in a compact epithelium induces 3D cell rearrangements during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies in the mouse demonstrate the importance of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and extra-cellular receptor tyrosine kinase (ERK) in specification of embryo-fated epiblast and yolk-sac-fated hypoblast cells from uncommitted inner cell mass (ICM) cells prior to implantation. Molecular mechanisms regulating specification of early lineages in human development are comparatively unclear. Here we show that exogenous FGF stimulation leads to expanded hypoblast molecular marker expression, at the expense of the epiblast. Conversely, we show that specifically inhibiting ERK activity leads to expansion of epiblast cells functionally capable of giving rise to naive human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicates that these epiblast cells downregulate FGF signalling and upregulate molecular markers associated with naive pluripotency. Our functional study demonstrates for the first time the molecular mechanisms governing ICM specification in human development, whereby segregation of the epiblast and hypoblast lineages occurs during maturation of the mammalian embryo in an ERK signal-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Failure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Preimplantation development is an important window of human embryogenesis. During this time, the initial lineages are formed which largely govern embryo competence, implantation, and ultimately the developmental potential of the fetus. Ethical constraints and limitations surrounding human embryos research often necessitates the use of a model system. We now identify the guinea pig as a promising small animal model, which closely recapitulates early human embryogenesis in terms of the timing of compaction, early-, mid-, and late-blastocyst formation and implantation. We also observe conserved spatio-temporal expression of key lineage markers, roles of both Hippo and MEK-ERK signaling and an incomplete X-Chromosome inactivation. Further, our multi-species analysis highlights the spatio-temporal expression of conserved and divergent genes during preimplantation development. The guinea pig serves as an exciting new model which will enhance developmental and pluripotency research and can be leveraged to better understand the longer term impact of early exposures on offspring outcomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem cell-based embryo models offer unprecedented experimental tools for studying early human development. The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exposure to pathogens throughout a lifetime influences immunity and organ function. Here, we explored how the systemic host-response to bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) induces tissue-specific alterations to the mammary gland. Utilizing a combination of histological tissue analysis, single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we identified that mammary tissue from UTI-bearing mice display collagen deposition, enlarged ductal structures, ductal hyperplasia with atypical epithelial transcriptomes and altered immune composition. Bacterial cells were absent in the mammary tissue and blood of UTI-bearing mice, therefore, alterations to the distal mammary tissue were mediated by the systemic host response to local infection. Furthermore, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment resolved the infection and restored mammary cellular and tissue homeostasis. Systemically, unresolved UTI correlated with increased plasma levels of the metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP1, which controls extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neutrophil function. Treatment of nulliparous and post-lactation UTI-bearing female mice with a TIMP1 neutralizing antibody, or broad-spectrum antibiotic, prevented mammary collagen deposition, thus providing evidence for an unexpected link between the systemic host response during UTI and mammary alterations.

SummaryThe systemic response during urinary tract infection induces TIMP1-driven collagen deposition specifically into the mammary gland.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During embryonic development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell fate specification. Although both transcription and mRNA degradation contribute to gene expression dynamics, patterns of mRNA decay are less well-understood. Here we directly measured spatiotemporally resolved mRNA decay rates transcriptome-wide throughout C. elegans embryogenesis by transcription inhibition followed by bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing. This allowed us to calculate mRNA half-lives within specific cell types and developmental stages and identify differentially regulated mRNA decay throughout embryonic development. We identified transcript features that are correlated with mRNA stability and found that mRNA decay rates are associated with distinct peaks in gene expression over time. Moreover, we provide evidence that, on average, mRNA is more stable in the germline compared to in the soma and in later embryonic stages compared to in earlier stages. This work suggests that differential mRNA decay across cell states and time helps to shape developmental gene expression, and it provides a valuable resource for studies of mRNA turnover regulatory mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Branching morphogenesis couples cellular differentiation with development of tissue architecture. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) morphogenesis is initiated with biliary epithelial cell (BEC) specification and eventually forms a heterogeneous network of large ducts and small ductules. Here, we show that Sox9 is required for developmental establishment of small ductules. IHBDs emerge as a webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, manifesting as loss of ductules in adult livers. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-{beta} signaling and Activin A. Activin A induces developmental gene expression and morphological defects in BEC organoids and represses ductule formation in postnatal livers. Our data demonstrate that adult IHBD morphology and BEC maturation is regulated by the Sox9-dependent formation of precursors to ductules during development, mediated in part by downregulation of Activin A.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Regulation of tissue growth is influenced by many signals, including polarity cues. The Hippo signalling pathway restricts tissue growth and receives inputs from the planar cell polarity-controlling Fat signalling pathway. The atypical cadherin Fat restricts growth via several mechanisms that ultimately control the activity of the pro-growth transcriptional activator Yorkie. Fat signalling modulates the activity of the Yorkie inhibitory kinase Warts, as well as the function of the FERM protein Expanded, which promotes Hippo signalling and also directly inhibits Yorkie. Although several Fat pathway activity modulators are known to be involved in ubiquitylation, the role of this post-translational modification in the pathway remains unclear. Moreover, no deubiquitylating enzymes have been described in this pathway. Here, using an in vivo RNAi screening approach, we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme Fat facets as a regulator of Fat signalling that is important for tissue growth regulation. Fat facets interacts genetically and physically with Fat signalling components and regulates transcription of Yorkie target genes. Thus, we uncover a role for reversible ubiquitylation in the strict control of Fat signalling and, by extension, in the regulation of tissue growth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.</p>
