I.; FitzHarris, G.\nScore: 24.6, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.566607\nCulture of oocytes and embryos in media under oil is a cornerstone of fertility treatment, and extensively employed in experimental investigation of early mammalian development. It has been noted anecdotally by some that certain small molecule inhibitors might lose activity in oil-covered culture systems, presumably by drug partitioning into the oil. Here we took a pseudo-pharmacological approach to appraise this formally. Using different culture dish designs with defined media:oil volume ratios, we show that the EC50 of the widely employed microtubule poison nocodazole shifts as a function of the media:oil ratio, such that nocodazole concentrations that prevent cell division in oil-free culture fail to in oil-covered media drops. Relatively subtle changes in culture dish design lead to measurable changes in EC50. This effect is not specific to one type of culture oil, and can be readily observed both in oocyte and embryo culture experiments. We subsequently applied a similar approach to a small panel of widely employed cell cycle-related inhibitors, finding that most lose activity in standard oil-covered oocyte/embryo culture systems. Our data suggest that loss of small molecule activity in oil-covered oocyte and embryo culture is a widespread phenomenon with potentially far-reaching implications for data reproducibility, and we recommend avoiding oil-covered culture for experiments employing inhibitors/drugs wherever possible.\nVangl2 deficient zebrafish exhibit hallmarks of neural tube closure defects\nAuthors: MacGowan, J.; Cardenas, M.; Williams, M. K.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566412\nNeural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most devastating and common congenital anomalies worldwide, and the ability to model these conditions in vivo is essential for identifying causative genetic and environmental factors. Although zebrafish are ideal for rapid candidate testing, their neural tubes develop primarily via a solid neural keel rather that the fold-and-fuse method employed by mammals, raising questions about their suitability as an NTD model. Here, we demonstrate that despite outward differences, zebrafish anterior neurulation closely resembles that of mammals. For the first time, we directly observe fusion of the bilateral neural folds to enclose a lumen in zebrafish embryos. The neural folds fuse by zippering between multiple distinct but contiguous closure sites. Embryos lacking vangl2, a core planar cell polarity and NTD risk gene, exhibit delayed neural fold fusion and abnormal neural groove formation, yielding distinct openings and midline bifurcations in the developing neural tube. These data provide direct evidence for fold-and-fuse neurulation in zebrafish and its disruption upon loss of an NTD risk gene, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the utility of zebrafish for modeling NTDs. Summary statementThe anterior neural tube of zebrafish exhibits fold-and-fuse neurulation which is disrupted upon loss of Vangl2, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the potential to model neural tube defects in zebrafish.\nTBXT dose sensitivity and the decoupling of nascent mesoderm specification from EMT progression in 2D human gastruloids\nAuthors: Bulger, E. A.; Muncie-Vasic, I.; Libby, A. R. G.; McDevitt, T. C.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-11-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565933\nIn the nascent mesoderm, levels of Brachyury (TBXT) expression must be precisely regulated to ensure cells exit the primitive streak and pattern the anterior-posterior axis, but how this varying dosage informs morphogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we define the transcriptional consequences of TBXT dose reduction during early human gastrulation using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of gastrulation and mesoderm differentiation. Multiomic single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing of 2D gastruloids comprised of WT, TBXT heterozygous (TBXT-Het), or TBXT null (TBXT-KO) hiPSCs reveal that varying TBXT dosage does not compromise a cells ability to differentiate into nascent mesoderm, but that the loss of TBXT significantly delays the temporal progression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This delay is dependent on TBXT dose, as cells heterozygous for TBXT proceed with EMT at an intermediate pace relative to WT or TBXT-KO. By differentiating iPSCs of the allelic series into nascent mesoderm in a monolayer format, we further illustrate that TBXT dose directly impacts the persistence of junctional proteins and cell-cell adhesions. These results demonstrate that EMT progression can be decoupled from the acquisition of mesodermal identity in the early gastrula and shed light on the mechanisms underlying human embryogenesis.\nClock driven waves of Tbx6 expression prefigure somite boundaries\nAuthors: Venzin, O. F.; Jollivet, C.; Chiaruttini, N.; Rosspopoff, O.; Helsens, C.; Morelli, L. G.; Uriu, K.; Oates, A. C.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566373\nThe segmented body plan of vertebrates is established during embryogenesis by periodic and sequential formation of multi-cellular structures called somites. Somitogenesis is an example of patterning by a biological oscillator, the segmentation clock, which manifests as traveling waves of oscillating Hes/Her gene expression, reiterating during the formation of each1-3. How these waves are converted into the striped Mesp gene expression pattern that prefigures morphological somite boundaries4-8 remains unclear. Here, we image this conversion in real-time at single-cell resolution in zebrafish, using light-sheet microscopy of a novel reporter of Tbx6, a key activator of Mesp expression. We observe cellular oscillations and kinematic waves of Tbx6 expression that are driven by Hes/Her genes. Tbx6 waves arrest precisely in boundary cells that eventually express Mesp, thereby prefiguring the Mesp pattern, whereas Hes/Her waves do not. Although Hes/Her oscillations began before somitogenesis9-11, the first Tbx6 wave defines the boundary cells of the anterior-most somite, forming the head-trunk interface. Our findings imply that Tbx6 acts as a genetic clutch, converting Her/Hes pacemaker waves into Mesp stripes. We propose that this clock design shields the pacemaker from external perturbations, allowing flexible and robust patterning, making it of interest for organoids and tissue-engineering.\nHuman organoid modeling of congenital malformations caused by RFX6 mutations reveal an essential role for this transcription factor in establishing and maintaining duodenal identity upstream of PDX1\nAuthors: Wells, J. M.; Sanchez, G.; Rankin, S. A.; Paul, E.; McCauley, H. A.; Kechele, D.; Enriquez, J.; Jones, N.-H.; Greeley, S. A.; Letourneau-Friedberg, L.; Zorn, A. A.; Krishnamurthy, M.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566480\nThe gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of highly specialized organs from the proximal esophagus to the distal colon, each with unique functions. Rare congenital malformations of the GI tract, including organ atresia, agenesis or mis-patterning are linked to gene mutations although the molecular basis of these malformations has been poorly studied due to lack of model systems to study human development. We identified a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 with pancreatic agenesis as previously described. In addition, the patient had duodenal mal-rotation and atresia suggesting that establishment of the proximal small intestine was impaired in these patients. To identify the molecular basis of the intestinal malformation we generated induced pluripotent stem cell lines from this patient, and derived human intestinal organoid (HIOs) to identify how mutations in RFX6 impact intestinal patterning and function. We identified that the duodenal identity of HIOs and patient tissues had adopted a more distal small intestinal signature, including expression of SATB2, normally expressed in the ileum and colon. CRISPR-mediated correction of RFX6 restored duodenal identity, including expression of PDX1, which is required for duodenal development. Using transcriptomic approaches in HIOs and Xenopus embryos we identified that PDX1 is a downstream transcriptional target of RFX6 and that PDX1 expression in a RFX6 mutant background was sufficient to rescue duodenal identity. However, RFX6 had a PDX1-independent role in regulating expression of components of WNT, HH, and BMP signaling pathways that are critical for establishing early regional identity in the GI tract. In summary, we have identified that RFX6 is one of the most upstream regulators early intestinal patterning in vertebrates and that it acts by regulating key transcriptional and signaling pathways.\nTranscriptome analysis of the mouse fetal and adult rete ovarii and surrounding tissues\nAuthors: Anbarci, D. N.; ORourke, R.; Xiang, Y.; Peters, D. T.; Capel, B.; McKey, J.\nScore: 11.9, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.06.565717\nThe rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during fetal development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood in mice. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it has been absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three distinct regions: the intraovarian rete (IOR) within the ovary, the extraovarian rete (EOR) in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete (CR) linking the EOR and IOR. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in maintaining ovarian homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. To uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptome analysis, encompassing bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level sequencing of both fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre- H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP. This study presents three datasets, which highlight RO-specific gene expression signatures and reveal differences in gene expression across the three RO regions during development and in adulthood. The integration and rigorous validation of these datasets will advance our understanding of the ROs roles in ovarian development, female maturation, and adult female fertility. Short narrativeThis study employs comprehensive bulk, single cell and single nucleus transcriptome analysis to uncover gene expression signatures of the fetal and adult rete ovarii (RO).\nRediscovering the Rete Ovarii: a secreting auxiliary structure to the ovary\nAuthors: Anbarci, D. N.; McKey, J.; Levic, D. S.; Bagnat, M.; Capel, B.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-11-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566085\nThe rete ovarii (RO) is an appendage of the ovary that has been given little attention. Although the RO appears in drawings of the ovary in early versions of Gray's Anatomy, it disappeared from recent textbooks, and is often dismissed as a functionless vestige in the adult ovary. Using PAX8 immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we characterized the fetal development of the RO in the context of the ovary. The RO consists of three distinct regions that persist in adult life, the intraovarian rete (IOR), the extraovarian rete (EOR), and the connecting rete (CR). While the cells of the IOR appear to form solid cords within the ovary, the EOR rapidly develops into a convoluted tubular epithelium ending in a distal dilated tip. Cells of the EOR are ciliated and exhibit cellular trafficking capabilities. The CR, connecting the EOR to the IOR, gradually acquires tubular epithelial characteristics by birth. Using microinjections into the distal dilated tip of the EOR, we found that luminal contents flow towards the ovary. Mass spectrometry revealed that the EOR lumen contains secreted proteins potentially important for ovarian function. We show that the cells of the EOR are closely associated with vasculature and macrophages, and are contacted by neuronal projections. The direct proximity of the RO to the ovary and its integration with the extraovarian landscape suggest that it plays an important role in ovary development and homeostasis.\nAlk1/Endoglin dependent increases in vein endothelial cell sizes precipitate arteriovenous malformations\nAuthors: Siekmann, A. F.; Diwan, Z.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.07.566079\nAberrations in blood vessel diameters can disrupt the hierarchical patterning of the vasculature and cause congenital vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Despite the identification of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway as a major driver in AVM pathology, we still lack an understanding of the early embryonic events regulating vessel hierarchy and arteriovenous shunt formation in vivo. We therefore studied blood vessel diameter control of the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV) in zebrafish embryos. Our findings reveal that increases in blood flow during embryonic development result in increases in arterial endothelial cell (EC) sizes, ultimately enlarging DA diameters. By contrast, anterior regions of the PCV did not respond to changes in blood flow, while caudal regions, close to the artery-vein junction, responded to changes in flow like the DA, but to a lesser extent. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the reduced response of PCV ECs to flow, we studied zebrafish embryos mutant for the BMP pathway components endoglin and alk1. Through the generation of genetic mosaics, we discovered that both Endoglin and Alk1 were required cell autonomously in PCV cells to restrict EC sizes and thereby limit venous diameter increases in response to flow. We further revealed that initial increases in the diameter of the caudal PCV secondarily led to increased DA diameters and cell sizes. Therefore, Alk1/Endoglin signaling prevents vein ECs from behaving like arterial ECs. This differential response of arterial and venous EC cells to increases in flow is necessary to prevent the development of AVMs. This study thus offers insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of vessel hierarchy during early development and identifies changes in EC shapes as an important contributor in determining blood vessel diameters. Failure in this mechanism underlies the vein-specific initiation of AVMs in vertebrate models of HHT.\nMaternal sterol 27-hydroxylase is crucial for securing fetal development\nAuthors: Suzuki, M.; Nakano, S.; Miharada, N.; Takei, H.; Prabhala, P.; van der Garde, M.; Müller, C.; Sigurdsson, V.; Aerken, M.; Saito, K.; Koide, S.; Westergren-Thorsson, G.; Magnusson, M.; Kakiyama, G.; Nittono, H.; Miharada, K.\nScore: 5.2, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566330\nThe maternal body helps in providing nutrients and degrading toxic metabolites instead of the fetal body; disruptions in these mechanisms affect normal fetal development. Sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1) is involved in the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, which is enhanced during pregnancy. However, its role in fetal development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that maternal Cyp27a1 activity is essential for progression of normal pregnancy and fetal organ formation. Depletion of maternal Cyp27a1 reduced the pregnancy rate and litter size. Newborn mice died of respiratory distress syndrome resulting from the absence of mature alveolar epithelial cells. These phenotypes were caused by 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-HC) accumulating in Cyp27a1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, 7-HC destabilized the Fau protein, mediating ribosome assembly, the downregulation of which caused poor polysome formation, lower protein synthesis, and impaired lung maturation. Overall, this study revealed an essential mechanism of securing fetal development by degrading a toxic metabolite in the maternal body.\nThe conserved wobble uridine tRNA thiolase Ctu1 is required to sustain development and differentiation\nAuthors: Zhou, Z.; Yu, Y.; Wang, C.; Wang, Y.; Shi, H.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566201\nRecent studies have revealed that tRNA modification is an important epigenetic mechanism involved in gene expression. Cytosolic thiouridylase (consisting of Ctu1 and Ctu2 subunit) are the enzyme complex which catalyze the thio-modification at the 34th wobble uridine of the anticodon of tRNAGlnUUG, tRNAGluUUC, and tRNALysUUU. Besides introducing a thiol group at the C2 positions, those tRNAs were commonly modified with a methoxycarbonylmethyl at the C5 positions by Elongator and ALKBH8. tRNA-U34 modification, particularly the Elongator and ALKBH8, has been demonstrated to be involved in disease and development, however, the biological functional level of CTU in vertebrates remains elusive. Here, we found that in zebrafish, CTU may be an important regulatory factor in development and erythroid differentiation. By using morpholino targeting and knocking down CTU1, we observed that the loss of CTU1 led to impaired zebrafish larval development and blood vessel formation. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that erythroid cell differentiation in the CTU1 knockdown group was blocked at an early stage, while the wild-type group exhibited mature erythroid cells. These findings suggest that CTU1 is involved in regulating erythrocyte development. These findings provide new insights into the biological function of CTU1.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Culture of oocytes and embryos in media under oil is a cornerstone of fertility treatment, and extensively employed in experimental investigation of early mammalian development. It has been noted anecdotally by some that certain small molecule inhibitors might lose activity in oil-covered culture systems, presumably by drug partitioning into the oil. Here we took a pseudo-pharmacological approach to appraise this formally. Using different culture dish designs with defined media:oil volume ratios, we show that the EC50 of the widely employed microtubule poison nocodazole shifts as a function of the media:oil ratio, such that nocodazole concentrations that prevent cell division in oil-free culture fail to in oil-covered media drops. Relatively subtle changes in culture dish design lead to measurable changes in EC50. This effect is not specific to one type of culture oil, and can be readily observed both in oocyte and embryo culture experiments. We subsequently applied a similar approach to a small panel of widely employed cell cycle-related inhibitors, finding that most lose activity in standard oil-covered oocyte/embryo culture systems. Our data suggest that loss of small molecule activity in oil-covered oocyte and embryo culture is a widespread phenomenon with potentially far-reaching implications for data reproducibility, and we recommend avoiding oil-covered culture for experiments employing inhibitors/drugs wherever possible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most devastating and common congenital anomalies worldwide, and the ability to model these conditions in vivo is essential for identifying causative genetic and environmental factors. Although zebrafish are ideal for rapid candidate testing, their neural tubes develop primarily via a solid neural keel rather that the fold-and-fuse method employed by mammals, raising questions about their suitability as an NTD model. Here, we demonstrate that despite outward differences, zebrafish anterior neurulation closely resembles that of mammals. For the first time, we directly observe fusion of the bilateral neural folds to enclose a lumen in zebrafish embryos. The neural folds fuse by zippering between multiple distinct but contiguous closure sites. Embryos lacking vangl2, a core planar cell polarity and NTD risk gene, exhibit delayed neural fold fusion and abnormal neural groove formation, yielding distinct openings and midline bifurcations in the developing neural tube. These data provide direct evidence for fold-and-fuse neurulation in zebrafish and its disruption upon loss of an NTD risk gene, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the utility of zebrafish for modeling NTDs.

Summary statementThe anterior neural tube of zebrafish exhibits fold-and-fuse neurulation which is disrupted upon loss of Vangl2, highlighting conservation of vertebrate neurulation and the potential to model neural tube defects in zebrafish.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In the nascent mesoderm, levels of Brachyury (TBXT) expression must be precisely regulated to ensure cells exit the primitive streak and pattern the anterior-posterior axis, but how this varying dosage informs morphogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we define the transcriptional consequences of TBXT dose reduction during early human gastrulation using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of gastrulation and mesoderm differentiation. Multiomic single-nucleus RNA and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing of 2D gastruloids comprised of WT, TBXT heterozygous (TBXT-Het), or TBXT null (TBXT-KO) hiPSCs reveal that varying TBXT dosage does not compromise a cells ability to differentiate into nascent mesoderm, but that the loss of TBXT significantly delays the temporal progression of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This delay is dependent on TBXT dose, as cells heterozygous for TBXT proceed with EMT at an intermediate pace relative to WT or TBXT-KO. By differentiating iPSCs of the allelic series into nascent mesoderm in a monolayer format, we further illustrate that TBXT dose directly impacts the persistence of junctional proteins and cell-cell adhesions. These results demonstrate that EMT progression can be decoupled from the acquisition of mesodermal identity in the early gastrula and shed light on the mechanisms underlying human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The segmented body plan of vertebrates is established during embryogenesis by periodic and sequential formation of multi-cellular structures called somites. Somitogenesis is an example of patterning by a biological oscillator, the segmentation clock, which manifests as traveling waves of oscillating Hes/Her gene expression, reiterating during the formation of each1-3. How these waves are converted into the striped Mesp gene expression pattern that prefigures morphological somite boundaries4-8 remains unclear. Here, we image this conversion in real-time at single-cell resolution in zebrafish, using light-sheet microscopy of a novel reporter of Tbx6, a key activator of Mesp expression. We observe cellular oscillations and kinematic waves of Tbx6 expression that are driven by Hes/Her genes. Tbx6 waves arrest precisely in boundary cells that eventually express Mesp, thereby prefiguring the Mesp pattern, whereas Hes/Her waves do not. Although Hes/Her oscillations began before somitogenesis9-11, the first Tbx6 wave defines the boundary cells of the anterior-most somite, forming the head-trunk interface. Our findings imply that Tbx6 acts as a genetic clutch, converting Her/Hes pacemaker waves into Mesp stripes. We propose that this clock design shields the pacemaker from external perturbations, allowing flexible and robust patterning, making it of interest for organoids and tissue-engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of highly specialized organs from the proximal esophagus to the distal colon, each with unique functions. Rare congenital malformations of the GI tract, including organ atresia, agenesis or mis-patterning are linked to gene mutations although the molecular basis of these malformations has been poorly studied due to lack of model systems to study human development. We identified a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 with pancreatic agenesis as previously described. In addition, the patient had duodenal mal-rotation and atresia suggesting that establishment of the proximal small intestine was impaired in these patients. To identify the molecular basis of the intestinal malformation we generated induced pluripotent stem cell lines from this patient, and derived human intestinal organoid (HIOs) to identify how mutations in RFX6 impact intestinal patterning and function. We identified that the duodenal identity of HIOs and patient tissues had adopted a more distal small intestinal signature, including expression of SATB2, normally expressed in the ileum and colon. CRISPR-mediated correction of RFX6 restored duodenal identity, including expression of PDX1, which is required for duodenal development. Using transcriptomic approaches in HIOs and Xenopus embryos we identified that PDX1 is a downstream transcriptional target of RFX6 and that PDX1 expression in a RFX6 mutant background was sufficient to rescue duodenal identity. However, RFX6 had a PDX1-independent role in regulating expression of components of WNT, HH, and BMP signaling pathways that are critical for establishing early regional identity in the GI tract. In summary, we have identified that RFX6 is one of the most upstream regulators early intestinal patterning in vertebrates and that it acts by regulating key transcriptional and signaling pathways.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The rete ovarii (RO) is an epithelial structure that arises during fetal development in close proximity to the ovary and persists throughout adulthood in mice. However, the functional significance of the RO remains elusive, and it has been absent from recent discussions of female reproductive anatomy. The RO comprises three distinct regions: the intraovarian rete (IOR) within the ovary, the extraovarian rete (EOR) in the periovarian tissue, and the connecting rete (CR) linking the EOR and IOR. We hypothesize that the RO plays a pivotal role in maintaining ovarian homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. To uncover the nature and function of RO cells, we conducted transcriptome analysis, encompassing bulk, single-cell, and nucleus-level sequencing of both fetal and adult RO tissues using the Pax8-rtTA; Tre- H2B-GFP mouse line, where all RO regions express nuclear GFP. This study presents three datasets, which highlight RO-specific gene expression signatures and reveal differences in gene expression across the three RO regions during development and in adulthood. The integration and rigorous validation of these datasets will advance our understanding of the ROs roles in ovarian development, female maturation, and adult female fertility.

        <p class="abstract">The rete ovarii (RO) is an appendage of the ovary that has been given little attention. Although the RO appears in drawings of the ovary in early versions of Gray&#39;s Anatomy, it disappeared from recent textbooks, and is often dismissed as a functionless vestige in the adult ovary. Using PAX8 immunostaining and confocal microscopy, we characterized the fetal development of the RO in the context of the ovary. The RO consists of three distinct regions that persist in adult life, the intraovarian rete (IOR), the extraovarian rete (EOR), and the connecting rete (CR). While the cells of the IOR appear to form solid cords within the ovary, the EOR rapidly develops into a convoluted tubular epithelium ending in a distal dilated tip. Cells of the EOR are ciliated and exhibit cellular trafficking capabilities. The CR, connecting the EOR to the IOR, gradually acquires tubular epithelial characteristics by birth. Using microinjections into the distal dilated tip of the EOR, we found that luminal contents flow towards the ovary. Mass spectrometry revealed that the EOR lumen contains secreted proteins potentially important for ovarian function. We show that the cells of the EOR are closely associated with vasculature and macrophages, and are contacted by neuronal projections. The direct proximity of the RO to the ovary and its integration with the extraovarian landscape suggest that it plays an important role in ovary development and homeostasis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aberrations in blood vessel diameters can disrupt the hierarchical patterning of the vasculature and cause congenital vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Despite the identification of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway as a major driver in AVM pathology, we still lack an understanding of the early embryonic events regulating vessel hierarchy and arteriovenous shunt formation in vivo. We therefore studied blood vessel diameter control of the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein (PCV) in zebrafish embryos. Our findings reveal that increases in blood flow during embryonic development result in increases in arterial endothelial cell (EC) sizes, ultimately enlarging DA diameters. By contrast, anterior regions of the PCV did not respond to changes in blood flow, while caudal regions, close to the artery-vein junction, responded to changes in flow like the DA, but to a lesser extent. To unravel the mechanisms underlying the reduced response of PCV ECs to flow, we studied zebrafish embryos mutant for the BMP pathway components endoglin and alk1. Through the generation of genetic mosaics, we discovered that both Endoglin and Alk1 were required cell autonomously in PCV cells to restrict EC sizes and thereby limit venous diameter increases in response to flow. We further revealed that initial increases in the diameter of the caudal PCV secondarily led to increased DA diameters and cell sizes. Therefore, Alk1/Endoglin signaling prevents vein ECs from behaving like arterial ECs. This differential response of arterial and venous EC cells to increases in flow is necessary to prevent the development of AVMs. This study thus offers insights into the spatiotemporal regulation of vessel hierarchy during early development and identifies changes in EC shapes as an important contributor in determining blood vessel diameters. Failure in this mechanism underlies the vein-specific initiation of AVMs in vertebrate models of HHT.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The maternal body helps in providing nutrients and degrading toxic metabolites instead of the fetal body; disruptions in these mechanisms affect normal fetal development. Sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1) is involved in the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, which is enhanced during pregnancy. However, its role in fetal development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that maternal Cyp27a1 activity is essential for progression of normal pregnancy and fetal organ formation. Depletion of maternal Cyp27a1 reduced the pregnancy rate and litter size. Newborn mice died of respiratory distress syndrome resulting from the absence of mature alveolar epithelial cells. These phenotypes were caused by 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-HC) accumulating in Cyp27a1-deficient mice. Mechanistically, 7-HC destabilized the Fau protein, mediating ribosome assembly, the downregulation of which caused poor polysome formation, lower protein synthesis, and impaired lung maturation. Overall, this study revealed an essential mechanism of securing fetal development by degrading a toxic metabolite in the maternal body.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent studies have revealed that tRNA modification is an important epigenetic mechanism involved in gene expression. Cytosolic thiouridylase (consisting of Ctu1 and Ctu2 subunit) are the enzyme complex which catalyze the thio-modification at the 34th wobble uridine of the anticodon of tRNAGlnUUG, tRNAGluUUC, and tRNALysUUU. Besides introducing a thiol group at the C2 positions, those tRNAs were commonly modified with a methoxycarbonylmethyl at the C5 positions by Elongator and ALKBH8. tRNA-U34 modification, particularly the Elongator and ALKBH8, has been demonstrated to be involved in disease and development, however, the biological functional level of CTU in vertebrates remains elusive. Here, we found that in zebrafish, CTU may be an important regulatory factor in development and erythroid differentiation. By using morpholino targeting and knocking down CTU1, we observed that the loss of CTU1 led to impaired zebrafish larval development and blood vessel formation. Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that erythroid cell differentiation in the CTU1 knockdown group was blocked at an early stage, while the wild-type group exhibited mature erythroid cells. These findings suggest that CTU1 is involved in regulating erythrocyte development. These findings provide new insights into the biological function of CTU1.</p>
