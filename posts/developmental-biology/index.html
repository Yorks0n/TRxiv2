E.; Tsai, Y.-Y.; Wood, C.; Piotrowski, T.\nScore: 24.3, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575421\nOrganisms adjust their physiology to cope with environmental fluctuations and maintain fitness. These adaptations occur via genetic changes over multiple generations or through acclimation, a set of reversible phenotypic changes that confer resilience to the individual. Aquatic organisms are subject to dramatic seasonal fluctuations in water salinity, which can affect the function of lateral line mechanosensory hair cells. To maintain hair cell function when salinity decreases, ion-regulating cells, Neuromast-associated ionocytes (Nm ionocytes), increase in number and invade lateral line neuromasts. How environmental changes trigger this adaptive differentiation of Nm ionocytes and how these cells are specified is still unknown. Here, we identify Nm ionocyte progenitors as foxi3a/foxi3b-expressing skin cells and show that their differentiation is associated with sequential activation of different Notch pathway components, which control ionocyte survival. We demonstrate that new Nm ionocytes are rapidly specified by absolute salinity levels, independently of stress response pathways. We further show that Nm ionocyte differentiation is selectively triggered by depletion of specific ions, such as Ca2+ and Na+/Cl-, but not by low K+ levels, and is independent of media osmolarity. Finally, we demonstrate that hair cell activity plays a role in Nm ionocyte recruitment and that systemic factors are not necessary for Nm ionocyte induction. In summary, we have identified how environmental changes activate a signaling cascade that triggers basal skin cell progenitors to differentiate into Nm ionocytes and invade lateral line organs. This adaptive behavior is an example of physiological plasticity that may prove essential for survival in changing climates.\nSox9 links biliary maturation to branching morphogenesis\nAuthors: Hrncir, H. R.; Bombin, S.; Goodloe, B.; Hogan, C. B.; Jadi, O.; Gracz, A. D.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.574730\nBranching morphogenesis couples cellular differentiation with development of tissue architecture. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) morphogenesis is initiated with biliary epithelial cell (BEC) specification and eventually forms a heterogeneous network of large ducts and small ductules. Here, we show that Sox9 is required for developmental establishment of small ductules. IHBDs emerge as a webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, manifesting as loss of ductules in adult livers. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-{beta} signaling and Activin A. Activin A induces developmental gene expression and morphological defects in BEC organoids and represses ductule formation in postnatal livers. Our data demonstrate that adult IHBD morphology and BEC maturation is regulated by the Sox9-dependent formation of precursors to ductules during development, mediated in part by downregulation of Activin A.\nA spatiotemporally resolved atlas of mRNA decay in the C. elegans embryo reveals differential regulation of mRNA stability across stages and cell types\nAuthors: Peng, F.; Nordgren, C. E.; Murray, J. I.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575757\nDuring embryonic development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell fate specification. Although both transcription and mRNA degradation contribute to gene expression dynamics, patterns of mRNA decay are less well-understood. Here we directly measured spatiotemporally resolved mRNA decay rates transcriptome-wide throughout C. elegans embryogenesis by transcription inhibition followed by bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing. This allowed us to calculate mRNA half-lives within specific cell types and developmental stages and identify differentially regulated mRNA decay throughout embryonic development. We identified transcript features that are correlated with mRNA stability and found that mRNA decay rates are associated with distinct peaks in gene expression over time. Moreover, we provide evidence that, on average, mRNA is more stable in the germline compared to in the soma and in later embryonic stages compared to in earlier stages. This work suggests that differential mRNA decay across cell states and time helps to shape developmental gene expression, and it provides a valuable resource for studies of mRNA turnover regulatory mechanisms.\nFoxO transcription factors actuate the formative pluripotency specific gene expression programme\nAuthors: Santini, L.; Kowald, S.; Sestini, G.; Rivron, N. C.; Leeb, M.\nScore: 7.1, Published: 2024-01-14 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.13.575494\nNaive pluripotency is sustained by a self-reinforcing gene regulatory network (GRN) comprising core and naive pluripotency-specific transcription factors (TFs). Upon exiting naive pluripotency, ES cells transition through a formative post-implantation-like pluripotent state, where they acquire competence for lineage-choice. However, the mechanisms underlying disengagement from the naive GRN and initiation of the formative GRN are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylated AKT acts as a gatekeeper that prevents nuclear localization of FoxO TFs in naive ESCs. PTEN-mediated reduction of AKT activity upon exit from naive pluripotency allows nuclear entry of FoxO TFs, enforcing a cell fate transition by binding and activating formative pluripotency-specific enhancers. Indeed, FoxO TFs are necessary and sufficient for transition from the naive to the formative pluripotent state. Our work uncovers a pivotal role for FoxO TFs and AKT signalling in mechanisms establishing formative post-implantation pluripotency, a critical early embryonic cell fate transition.\nNeutrophil immune profile controls spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish\nAuthors: de Sena-Tomas, C.; Lameira, L.; Naique Taborda, P.; Laborde, A.; Orger, M. B.; de Oliveira, S.; Saude, L.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.576035\nSpinal cord injury triggers a strong innate inflammatory response in both non-regenerative mammals and regenerative zebrafish. Neutrophils are the first immune population to be recruited to the injury site. Yet, their role in the repair process, particularly in a regenerative context, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that, following rapid recruitment to the injured spinal cord, neutrophils mostly reverse migrate throughout the zebrafish body. In addition, promoting neutrophil inflammation resolution by inhibiting Cxcr4 boosts cellular and functional regeneration. Neutrophil-specific RNA-seq analysis reveals an enhanced activation state that correlates with a transient increase in tnf- expression in macrophage/microglia populations. Conversely, blocking neutrophil recruitment through Cxcr1/2 inhibition diminishes the presence of macrophage/microglia at the injury site and impairs spinal cord regeneration. Altogether, these findings provide new insights into the role of neutrophils in spinal cord regeneration, emphasizing the significant impact of their immune profile on the outcome of the repair process.\nAn inappropriate decline in ribosome levels drives a diverse set of neurodevelopmental disorders\nAuthors: Ni, C.; Yu, L.; Vona, B.; Park, D.; Wei, Y.; Schmitz, D.; Wei, Y.; Ding, Y.; Sakurai, M.; Ballard, E.; Liu, Y.; Kumar, A.; Xing, C.; Kim, H.-G.; Ekmekci, C.; Karimiani, E.; Imannezhad, S.; Eghbal, F.; Badv, R.; Schwaibold, E.; Dehghani, M.; Mehrjardi, M.; Metanat, Z.; Eslamiyeh, H.; Khouj, E.; Alhajj, S.; Chedrawi, A.; Alves, C.; Houlden, H.; Kruer, M.; Alkuraya, F.; Cenik, C.; Maroofian, R.; Wu, J.; Buszczak, M.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574708\nMany neurodevelopmental defects are linked to perturbations in genes involved in housekeeping functions, such as those encoding ribosome biogenesis factors. However, how reductions in ribosome biogenesis can result in tissue and developmental specific defects remains a mystery. Here we describe new allelic variants in the ribosome biogenesis factor AIRIM primarily associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Using human cerebral organoids in combination with proteomic analysis, single-cell transcriptome analysis across multiple developmental stages, and single organoid translatome analysis, we identify a previously unappreciated mechanism linking changes in ribosome levels and the timing of cell fate specification during early brain development. We find ribosome levels decrease during neuroepithelial differentiation, making differentiating cells particularly vulnerable to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis during this time. Reduced ribosome availability more profoundly impacts the translation of specific transcripts, disrupting both survival and cell fate commitment of transitioning neuroepithelia. Enhancing mTOR activity by both genetic and pharmacologic approaches ameliorates the growth and developmental defects associated with intellectual disability linked variants, identifying potential treatment options for specific brain ribosomopathies. This work reveals the cellular and molecular origins of protein synthesis defect-related disorders of human brain development. HighlightsO_LIAIRIM variants reduce ribosome levels specifically in neural progenitor cells. C_LIO_LIInappropriately low ribosome levels cause a transient delay in radial glia fate commitment.

J.; Sanchez-Cabo, F.; Dominguez, J. N.; Torres, M.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575188\nUnderstanding the diversification of mammalian cell lineages is an essential to embryonic development, organ regeneration and tissue engineering. Shortly after implantation in the uterus, the pluripotent cells of the mammalian epiblast generate the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm1. Although clonal analyses suggest early specification of epiblast cells towards particular cell lineages2-4, single-cell transcriptomes do not identify lineage-specific markers in the epiblast5-11 and thus, the molecular regulation of such specification remains unknow. Here, we studied the epigenetic landscape of single epiblast cells, which revealed lineage priming towards endoderm, ectoderm or mesoderm. Unexpectedly, epiblast cells with mesodermal priming show a strong signature for the endothelial/endocardial fate, suggesting early specification of this lineage aside from other mesoderm. Through clonal analysis and live imaging, we show that endothelial precursors show early lineage divergence from the rest of mesodermal derivatives. In particular, cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells show limited lineage relationship, despite being temporally and spatially co-recruited during gastrulation. Furthermore, analysing the live tracks of single cells through unsupervised classification of cell migratory activity, we found early behavioral divergence of endothelial precursors shortly after the onset of mesoderm migration towards the cardiogenic area. These results provide a new model for the phenotypically silent specification of mammalian cell lineages in pluripotent cells of the epiblast and modify current knowledge on the sequence and timing of cardiovascular lineages diversification12,13.\nCell density couples tissue mechanics to control the elongation speed of the body axis\nAuthors: Lu, C.; Vidigueira, J. M. N.; Jie, C. C. J.; Maksymiuk, A.; Xiong, F.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573670\nThe vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation1-3. Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock4. As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size5,6 or elongation progress7,8, the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy9 on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.\nSAX-7/L1CAM acts with the adherens junction proteins MAGI-1, HMR-1/Cadherin, and AFD-1/Afadin to promote glial-mediated dendrite extension\nAuthors: Cebul, E.; Marivin, A.; Wexler, L.; Perrat, P.; Benard, C. Y.; Garcia-Marcos, M. G.; Heiman, M. G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575259\nAdherens junctions (AJs) are a fundamental organizing structure for multicellular life. Although AJs are studied mainly in epithelia, their core function - stabilizing cell contacts by coupling adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton - is important in diverse tissues. We find that two C. elegans sensory neurons, URX and BAG, require conserved AJ proteins for dendrite morphogenesis. We previously showed that URX and BAG dendrites attach to the embryonic nose via the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM, acting both in neurons and glia, and then extend by stretch during embryo elongation. Here, we find that a PDZ-binding motif (PB) in the SAX-7 cytoplasmic tail acts with other interaction motifs to promote dendrite extension. Using pull-down assays, we find that the SAX-7 PB binds the multi-PDZ scaffolding protein MAGI-1, which bridges it to the cadherin-catenin complex protein HMP-2/{beta}-catenin. Using cell-specific rescue and depletion, we find that both MAGI-1 and HMR-1/Cadherin act in glia to non-autonomously promote dendrite extension. Double mutant analysis indicates that each protein can act independently of SAX-7, suggesting a multivalent adhesion complex. The SAX-7 PB motif also binds AFD-1/Afadin, loss of which further enhances sax-7 BAG dendrite defects. As MAGI-1, HMR-1, and AFD-1 are all found in epithelial AJs, we propose that an AJ-like complex in glia promotes dendrite extension.\nNGN3 oscillatory expression controls the timing of human pancreatic endocrine differentiation\nAuthors: Miller, A.; Biga, V.; Rowntree, A.; Chhatriwala, M.; Woods, F.; Marinopoulou, E.; Kamath, A.; Vallier, L.; Papalopulu, N.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.574974\nUnderstanding protein expression dynamics is crucial for the mechanistic understanding of cell differentiation. We investigate the dynamics of NGN3, a transcription factor critical for pancreatic endocrine development, including their function and decoding mechanisms. A knock-in endogenous reporter shows that the expression of NGN3 protein oscillates with a 13-hour periodicity in human iPS-derived endocrine progenitors and is switched off as cells differentiate to {beta}-like and -like cells. Increasing the stability of NGN3 protein results in one broad peak of expression instead of oscillations, with a larger peak to trough fold-change. This leads to precocious endocrine differentiation to both {beta}-like and -like cells and precocious expression of key NGN3 target genes. Single-cell analysis of dynamics, mathematical modelling and bioinformatics suggest that decoding of NGN3 oscillations occurs by fold-change detection via an incoherent feedforward motif that explains both normal and precocious differentiation. Our findings suggest that oscillatory NGN3 dynamics control the timing of differentiation, but not fate specification.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Organisms adjust their physiology to cope with environmental fluctuations and maintain fitness. These adaptations occur via genetic changes over multiple generations or through acclimation, a set of reversible phenotypic changes that confer resilience to the individual. Aquatic organisms are subject to dramatic seasonal fluctuations in water salinity, which can affect the function of lateral line mechanosensory hair cells. To maintain hair cell function when salinity decreases, ion-regulating cells, Neuromast-associated ionocytes (Nm ionocytes), increase in number and invade lateral line neuromasts. How environmental changes trigger this adaptive differentiation of Nm ionocytes and how these cells are specified is still unknown. Here, we identify Nm ionocyte progenitors as foxi3a/foxi3b-expressing skin cells and show that their differentiation is associated with sequential activation of different Notch pathway components, which control ionocyte survival. We demonstrate that new Nm ionocytes are rapidly specified by absolute salinity levels, independently of stress response pathways. We further show that Nm ionocyte differentiation is selectively triggered by depletion of specific ions, such as Ca2&#43; and Na&#43;/Cl-, but not by low K&#43; levels, and is independent of media osmolarity. Finally, we demonstrate that hair cell activity plays a role in Nm ionocyte recruitment and that systemic factors are not necessary for Nm ionocyte induction. In summary, we have identified how environmental changes activate a signaling cascade that triggers basal skin cell progenitors to differentiate into Nm ionocytes and invade lateral line organs. This adaptive behavior is an example of physiological plasticity that may prove essential for survival in changing climates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Branching morphogenesis couples cellular differentiation with development of tissue architecture. Intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) morphogenesis is initiated with biliary epithelial cell (BEC) specification and eventually forms a heterogeneous network of large ducts and small ductules. Here, we show that Sox9 is required for developmental establishment of small ductules. IHBDs emerge as a webbed structure by E15.5 and undergo morphological maturation through 2 weeks of age. Developmental knockout of Sox9 leads to decreased postnatal branching morphogenesis, manifesting as loss of ductules in adult livers. In the absence of Sox9, BECs fail to mature and exhibit elevated TGF-{beta} signaling and Activin A. Activin A induces developmental gene expression and morphological defects in BEC organoids and represses ductule formation in postnatal livers. Our data demonstrate that adult IHBD morphology and BEC maturation is regulated by the Sox9-dependent formation of precursors to ductules during development, mediated in part by downregulation of Activin A.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During embryonic development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell fate specification. Although both transcription and mRNA degradation contribute to gene expression dynamics, patterns of mRNA decay are less well-understood. Here we directly measured spatiotemporally resolved mRNA decay rates transcriptome-wide throughout C. elegans embryogenesis by transcription inhibition followed by bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing. This allowed us to calculate mRNA half-lives within specific cell types and developmental stages and identify differentially regulated mRNA decay throughout embryonic development. We identified transcript features that are correlated with mRNA stability and found that mRNA decay rates are associated with distinct peaks in gene expression over time. Moreover, we provide evidence that, on average, mRNA is more stable in the germline compared to in the soma and in later embryonic stages compared to in earlier stages. This work suggests that differential mRNA decay across cell states and time helps to shape developmental gene expression, and it provides a valuable resource for studies of mRNA turnover regulatory mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Naive pluripotency is sustained by a self-reinforcing gene regulatory network (GRN) comprising core and naive pluripotency-specific transcription factors (TFs). Upon exiting naive pluripotency, ES cells transition through a formative post-implantation-like pluripotent state, where they acquire competence for lineage-choice. However, the mechanisms underlying disengagement from the naive GRN and initiation of the formative GRN are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylated AKT acts as a gatekeeper that prevents nuclear localization of FoxO TFs in naive ESCs. PTEN-mediated reduction of AKT activity upon exit from naive pluripotency allows nuclear entry of FoxO TFs, enforcing a cell fate transition by binding and activating formative pluripotency-specific enhancers. Indeed, FoxO TFs are necessary and sufficient for transition from the naive to the formative pluripotent state. Our work uncovers a pivotal role for FoxO TFs and AKT signalling in mechanisms establishing formative post-implantation pluripotency, a critical early embryonic cell fate transition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Spinal cord injury triggers a strong innate inflammatory response in both non-regenerative mammals and regenerative zebrafish. Neutrophils are the first immune population to be recruited to the injury site. Yet, their role in the repair process, particularly in a regenerative context, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that, following rapid recruitment to the injured spinal cord, neutrophils mostly reverse migrate throughout the zebrafish body. In addition, promoting neutrophil inflammation resolution by inhibiting Cxcr4 boosts cellular and functional regeneration. Neutrophil-specific RNA-seq analysis reveals an enhanced activation state that correlates with a transient increase in tnf- expression in macrophage/microglia populations. Conversely, blocking neutrophil recruitment through Cxcr1/2 inhibition diminishes the presence of macrophage/microglia at the injury site and impairs spinal cord regeneration. Altogether, these findings provide new insights into the role of neutrophils in spinal cord regeneration, emphasizing the significant impact of their immune profile on the outcome of the repair process.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many neurodevelopmental defects are linked to perturbations in genes involved in housekeeping functions, such as those encoding ribosome biogenesis factors. However, how reductions in ribosome biogenesis can result in tissue and developmental specific defects remains a mystery. Here we describe new allelic variants in the ribosome biogenesis factor AIRIM primarily associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Using human cerebral organoids in combination with proteomic analysis, single-cell transcriptome analysis across multiple developmental stages, and single organoid translatome analysis, we identify a previously unappreciated mechanism linking changes in ribosome levels and the timing of cell fate specification during early brain development. We find ribosome levels decrease during neuroepithelial differentiation, making differentiating cells particularly vulnerable to perturbations in ribosome biogenesis during this time. Reduced ribosome availability more profoundly impacts the translation of specific transcripts, disrupting both survival and cell fate commitment of transitioning neuroepithelia. Enhancing mTOR activity by both genetic and pharmacologic approaches ameliorates the growth and developmental defects associated with intellectual disability linked variants, identifying potential treatment options for specific brain ribosomopathies. This work reveals the cellular and molecular origins of protein synthesis defect-related disorders of human brain development.

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the diversification of mammalian cell lineages is an essential to embryonic development, organ regeneration and tissue engineering. Shortly after implantation in the uterus, the pluripotent cells of the mammalian epiblast generate the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm1. Although clonal analyses suggest early specification of epiblast cells towards particular cell lineages2-4, single-cell transcriptomes do not identify lineage-specific markers in the epiblast5-11 and thus, the molecular regulation of such specification remains unknow. Here, we studied the epigenetic landscape of single epiblast cells, which revealed lineage priming towards endoderm, ectoderm or mesoderm. Unexpectedly, epiblast cells with mesodermal priming show a strong signature for the endothelial/endocardial fate, suggesting early specification of this lineage aside from other mesoderm. Through clonal analysis and live imaging, we show that endothelial precursors show early lineage divergence from the rest of mesodermal derivatives. In particular, cardiomyocytes and endocardial cells show limited lineage relationship, despite being temporally and spatially co-recruited during gastrulation. Furthermore, analysing the live tracks of single cells through unsupervised classification of cell migratory activity, we found early behavioral divergence of endothelial precursors shortly after the onset of mesoderm migration towards the cardiogenic area. These results provide a new model for the phenotypically silent specification of mammalian cell lineages in pluripotent cells of the epiblast and modify current knowledge on the sequence and timing of cardiovascular lineages diversification12,13.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation1-3. Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock4. As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size5,6 or elongation progress7,8, the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy9 on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adherens junctions (AJs) are a fundamental organizing structure for multicellular life. Although AJs are studied mainly in epithelia, their core function - stabilizing cell contacts by coupling adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton - is important in diverse tissues. We find that two C. elegans sensory neurons, URX and BAG, require conserved AJ proteins for dendrite morphogenesis. We previously showed that URX and BAG dendrites attach to the embryonic nose via the adhesion molecule SAX-7/L1CAM, acting both in neurons and glia, and then extend by stretch during embryo elongation. Here, we find that a PDZ-binding motif (PB) in the SAX-7 cytoplasmic tail acts with other interaction motifs to promote dendrite extension. Using pull-down assays, we find that the SAX-7 PB binds the multi-PDZ scaffolding protein MAGI-1, which bridges it to the cadherin-catenin complex protein HMP-2/{beta}-catenin. Using cell-specific rescue and depletion, we find that both MAGI-1 and HMR-1/Cadherin act in glia to non-autonomously promote dendrite extension. Double mutant analysis indicates that each protein can act independently of SAX-7, suggesting a multivalent adhesion complex. The SAX-7 PB motif also binds AFD-1/Afadin, loss of which further enhances sax-7 BAG dendrite defects. As MAGI-1, HMR-1, and AFD-1 are all found in epithelial AJs, we propose that an AJ-like complex in glia promotes dendrite extension.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding protein expression dynamics is crucial for the mechanistic understanding of cell differentiation. We investigate the dynamics of NGN3, a transcription factor critical for pancreatic endocrine development, including their function and decoding mechanisms. A knock-in endogenous reporter shows that the expression of NGN3 protein oscillates with a 13-hour periodicity in human iPS-derived endocrine progenitors and is switched off as cells differentiate to {beta}-like and -like cells. Increasing the stability of NGN3 protein results in one broad peak of expression instead of oscillations, with a larger peak to trough fold-change. This leads to precocious endocrine differentiation to both {beta}-like and -like cells and precocious expression of key NGN3 target genes. Single-cell analysis of dynamics, mathematical modelling and bioinformatics suggest that decoding of NGN3 oscillations occurs by fold-change detection via an incoherent feedforward motif that explains both normal and precocious differentiation. Our findings suggest that oscillatory NGN3 dynamics control the timing of differentiation, but not fate specification.</p>
