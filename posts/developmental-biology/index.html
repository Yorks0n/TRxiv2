Here, we establish long-term, live light sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labeled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviors, and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labeling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track Actin, Tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus, and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization, and brain regionalization. Based on imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrixinduced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signaling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the Wnt Ligand Secretion Mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of nontelencephalic brain regions. Altogether, our work provides a new inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics, and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics play a central role during brain regionalization.\nModular control of time and space during vertebrate axis segmentation\nAuthors: Seleit, A.; Brettell, I.; Fitzgerald, T. W.; Vibe, C.; Loosli, F.; Wittbrodt, J.; Naruse, K.; Birney, E.; Aulehla, A.\nScore: 27.5, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.30.555457\nHow temporal and spatial control of developmental processes are linked remains a fundamental question. Do underlying mechanisms form a single functional unit or are these dissociable modules? We address this question by studying the periodic process of embryonic axis segmentation, using genetic crosses of inbred medaka fish strains representing two species, Oryzias sakaizumii and latipes. Our analysis revealed correlated interspecies differences with regard to the timing of segmentation, the size of segments and of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), from which segments are periodically formed. We then did interspecies crosses and real-time imaging quantifications, which revealed extensive phenotypic variation in [~]600 F2 embryos. Importantly, while the F2 analysis showed correlated changes of PSM and segment size, these spatial measures were not correlated to the timing of segmentation. This shows that the control of time and space of axis segmentation can, in principle, be decoupled. In line with this finding, we identified, using developmental quantitative trait loci (devQTL) mapping, distinct chromosomal regions linked to either the control of segmentation timing or PSM size. We were able to validate the devQTL findings using a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function approach on several candidate genes in vivo. Combined, this study reveals that a developmental constraint mechanism underlies spatial scaling of axis segmentation, while its spatial and temporal control are dissociable modules. Our findings emphasise the need to reveal the selective constraints linking these modules in the natural environment.\nMorphogen gradients can convey position and time in growing tissues\nAuthors: Vetter, R.; Iber, D.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-09-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.28.555133\nDuring development, cells need to make fate decisions according to their position and the developmental timepoint. Morphogen gradients provide positional information, but how timing is controlled has remained elusive. In the mouse neural tube, morphogen signalling is transient and peaks shortly before the onset of differentiation. Here, we show that in morphogen gradients with constant decay length, cells experience transient, biphasic concentration profiles if the morphogen source expands in parallel with the uniformly growing tissue. This novel patterning paradigm offers a simple mechanism for the simultaneous control of position and time by morphogen gradients, and might apply in many patterning systems, as uniform growth is observed widely in development.\nA single-cell atlas of pig gastrulation as a resource for comparative embryology\nAuthors: Simpson, L.; Strange, A.; Klisch, D.; Kraunsoe, S.; Azami, T.; Goszczynski, D.; Le, T.; Planells, B.; Holmes, N.; Sang, F.; Henson, S.; Loose, M. W.; Nichols, J.; Alberio, R.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-09-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.31.555712\nEarly mammalian gastrulations cell-fate decisions are poorly understood due to difficulties obtaining non-rodent embryos. The bilaminar disc of pig embryos mirrors humans, making them a useful proxy for studying gastrulation. Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig gastrulation, revealing cell-fate emergence dynamics, as well as conserved and divergent gene programs governing early porcine, primate, and murine development. We highlight heterochronicity in extraembryonic cell-type development, despite the broad conservation of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. We apply these findings in combination with functional investigations, to outline conserved spatial, molecular, and temporal events during definitive endoderm (DE). We find early FOXA2+/TBXT-embryonic disc cells directly from DE, contrasting later-emerging FOXA2/TBXT+ node/notochord progenitors. Unlike mesoderm, none of these progenitors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DE/Node fate hinges on balanced WNT and hypoblast-derived NODAL, which is extinguished upon DE differentiation. These findings emphasise the interplay between temporal and topological signalling in early fate decisions during gastrulation.\nVolumetric trans-scale imaging of massive quantity of heterogeneous cell populations in centimeter-wide tissue and embryo\nAuthors: Ichimura, T.; Kakizuka, T.; Sato, Y.; Itano, K.; Seiriki, K.; Hashimoto, H.; Itoga, H.; Onami, S.; Nagai, T.\nScore: 22.7, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.553997\nWe established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of 2x and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 {micro}m across an FOV of approximately 1.5 x 1.0 cm2. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 x 105 vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.\nA mechanically regulated liquid-liquid phase separation of the transcriptional regulator Tono instructs muscle development\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Avellaneda, J.; Spletter, M. L.; Lemke, S. B.; Mangeol, P.; Habermann, B. H.; Schnorrer, F.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2023-08-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.27.555003\nMuscle morphogenesis is a multi-step program, starting with myoblast fusion, followed by myotube-tendon attachment and sarcomere assembly, with subsequent sarcomere maturation, mitochondrial amplification and specialisation. The correct chronological order of these steps requires precise control of the transcriptional regulators and their effectors. How this regulation is achieved during muscle development is not well understood. In a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila, we identified the BTB-zinc finger protein Tono (CG32121) as a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator. tono mutant flight muscles display severe deficits in mitochondria and sarcomere maturation, resulting in uncontrolled contractile forces causing muscle atrophy during development. Tono protein is expressed during sarcomere maturation and localises in distinct condensates in flight muscle nuclei. Interestingly, internal pressure exerted by the maturing sarcomeres deforms the muscle nuclei into elongated shapes and changes the Tono condensates, suggesting that Tono senses the mechanical status of the muscle cells. Indeed, external mechanical pressure on the muscles triggers rapid liquid-liquid phase separation of Tono utilising its BTB domain. Thus, we propose that Tono senses high mechanical pressure to in turn adapt muscle transcription specifically at the sarcomere maturation stage. Consistently, tono mutant muscles display specific defects in a transcriptional switch that represses early muscle differentiation genes and boosts late ones. We hypothesise that a similar mechano-responsive regulation mechanism may control the activity of related BTB-zinc finger proteins that, if mutated, can result in uncontrolled force production in human muscle.\nPrimate-expressed EPIREGULIN promotes basal progenitor proliferation in the developing neocortex\nAuthors: Cubillos, P.; Ditzer, N.; Kolodziejczyk, A.; Schwenk, G.; Hoffmann, J.; Schütze, T. M.; Derihaci, R. P.; Birdir, C.; Köllner, J. E. M.; Petzold, A.; Sarov, M.; Martin, U.; Long, K. R.; Wimberger, P.; Albert, M.\nScore: 28.6, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554446\nNeocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.\nPrickle and Ror modulate Dishevelled-Vangl interaction to regulate non-canonical Wnt signaling during convergent extension\nAuthors: Wang, J.; Chang, C.; Seo, H.-s.; Yu, D.; Popov, I.; Tao, J.; Angermeier, A.; Sha, B.; Axelrod, J.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-08-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555374\nConvergent extension (CE) is a fundamental morphogenetic process where oriented cell behaviors lead to polarized extension of diverse tissues. In vertebrates, regulation of CE requires both non-canonical Wnt, its co-receptor Ror, and \"core members\" of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP was originally identified as a mechanism to coordinate the cellular polarity in the plane of static epithelium, where core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/ Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/ Prickel (Pk) partition to opposing cell cortex. But how core PCP proteins interact with each other to mediate non-canonical Wnt/ Ror signaling during CE is not clear. We found previously that during CE, Vangl cell-autonomously recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane but simultaneously keeps Dvl inactive. In this study, we show that non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz. PK inhibits the transition, and functionally synergize with Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE. Conversely, Ror is required for the transition, and functionally antagonizes Vangl. Biochemically, Vangl interacts directly with both Ror and Dvl. Ror and Dvl do not bind directly, but can be cofractionated with Vangl. We propose that Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror from ectopically activating non-canonical Wnt signaling; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz for signaling activation upon non-canonical Wnt induced dimerization of Fz and Ror.\nTgfbr1 regulates lateral plate mesoderm and endoderm reorganization during the trunk to tail transition\nAuthors: Lozovska, A.; Nóvoa, A.; Kuo, Y.-Y.; Jurberg, A. D.; Martins, G. G.; Hadjantonakis, A.-K.; Mallo, M.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554351\nDuring the trunk to tail transition the mammalian embryo builds the outlets for the intestinal and urogenital tracts, lays down the primordia for the hindlimb and external genitalia, and switches from the epiblast/primitive streak to the tailbud as the driver of axial extension. Genetic and molecular data indicate that Tgfbr1 is a key regulator of the trunk to tail transition. Tgfbr1 has been shown to control the switch of the neuro mesodermal-competent cells from the epiblast to the chordo-neural hinge to generate the tail bud. We now show that Tgfbr1 signaling also controls the remodeling of the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and of the embryonic endoderm associated with the trunk to tail transition. In the absence of Tgfbr1 the two LPM layers fail to converge at the end of the trunk, extending instead as separate layers enclosing the celomic cavity until the caudal embryonic extremity, lacking signs of the presence of primordia for the hindlimb or for external genitalia. However, this extended LPM, does not exhibit the molecular signatures characteristic of this tissue in the trunk. The vascular remodeling involving the dorsal aorta and the allantois artery leading to the connection between embryonic and extraembryonic circulation was also affected in the Tgfbr1 mutant embryos. Similar alterations in the LPM and vascular system were also observed in Isl1 null mutants, indicating that this factor acts in the regulatory cascade downstream of Tgfbr1 in LPM-derived tissues. In addition, in the absence of Tgfbr1 the embryonic endoderm fails to build the endodermal cloaca and to extend posteriorly to generate the tail gut. We present evidence suggesting that the remodeling activity of Tgfbr1 in the LPM and endoderm results from the control of the posterior primitive streak fate after its regression during the trunk to tail transition. Our data, together with previously published observations, place Tgfbr1 at the top of the regulatory processes controlling the trunk to tail transition.\nA distinct class of hematopoietic stem cells develop from the human yellow bone marrow\nAuthors: Nguyen, T. T.; Loureiro, Z. Y.; Desai, A.; DeSouza, T.; Joyce, S.; Khair, L.; Samant, A.; Cirka, H.; Solivan-Rivera, J.; Ziegler, R.; Brehm, M.; Messina, L. M.; Corvera, S.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555167\nAging and metabolic diseases are accompanied by systemic inflammation, but the mechanisms that induce this state are not known. We developed a human bone-marrow organoid system to explore mechanisms underlying metabolic-disease associated systemic inflammation. We find that a distinct type of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) develops in the adipose-rich, yellow bone marrow, which is known to gradually replace the hematopoietic red marrow as we age and during metabolic disease. Unlike HSCs derived from the red bone marrow, HSCs derived from the yellow bone marrow have higher proliferation rates, increase myeloid differentiation, skew towards pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage differentiation, and express a distinct transcriptomic profile associated with responsiveness to wounding. Yellow marrow-derived HSCs express higher levels of the leptin receptor, which we find to be further increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our work demonstrates that the human long bone yellow marrow is a niche for a distinct class of HSCs which could underlie hematopoietic dysfunction during aging and metabolic disease processes suggesting a shared inflammaging mechanism.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Brain organoids enable the mechanistic study of human brain development, and provide opportunities to explore self-organization in unconstrained developmental systems. Here, we establish long-term, live light sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labeled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviors, and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development. We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labeling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track Actin, Tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus, and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization, and brain regionalization. Based on imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrixinduced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signaling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the Wnt Ligand Secretion Mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of nontelencephalic brain regions. Altogether, our work provides a new inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics, and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics play a central role during brain regionalization.</p>

        <p class="abstract">How temporal and spatial control of developmental processes are linked remains a fundamental question. Do underlying mechanisms form a single functional unit or are these dissociable modules?

We address this question by studying the periodic process of embryonic axis segmentation, using genetic crosses of inbred medaka fish strains representing two species, Oryzias sakaizumii and latipes. Our analysis revealed correlated interspecies differences with regard to the timing of segmentation, the size of segments and of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), from which segments are periodically formed. We then did interspecies crosses and real-time imaging quantifications, which revealed extensive phenotypic variation in [~]600 F2 embryos. Importantly, while the F2 analysis showed correlated changes of PSM and segment size, these spatial measures were not correlated to the timing of segmentation. This shows that the control of time and space of axis segmentation can, in principle, be decoupled. In line with this finding, we identified, using developmental quantitative trait loci (devQTL) mapping, distinct chromosomal regions linked to either the control of segmentation timing or PSM size. We were able to validate the devQTL findings using a CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function approach on several candidate genes in vivo.

Combined, this study reveals that a developmental constraint mechanism underlies spatial scaling of axis segmentation, while its spatial and temporal control are dissociable modules. Our findings emphasise the need to reveal the selective constraints linking these modules in the natural environment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During development, cells need to make fate decisions according to their position and the developmental timepoint. Morphogen gradients provide positional information, but how timing is controlled has remained elusive. In the mouse neural tube, morphogen signalling is transient and peaks shortly before the onset of differentiation. Here, we show that in morphogen gradients with constant decay length, cells experience transient, biphasic concentration profiles if the morphogen source expands in parallel with the uniformly growing tissue. This novel patterning paradigm offers a simple mechanism for the simultaneous control of position and time by morphogen gradients, and might apply in many patterning systems, as uniform growth is observed widely in development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Early mammalian gastrulations cell-fate decisions are poorly understood due to difficulties obtaining non-rodent embryos. The bilaminar disc of pig embryos mirrors humans, making them a useful proxy for studying gastrulation. Here we present a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig gastrulation, revealing cell-fate emergence dynamics, as well as conserved and divergent gene programs governing early porcine, primate, and murine development. We highlight heterochronicity in extraembryonic cell-type development, despite the broad conservation of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs. We apply these findings in combination with functional investigations, to outline conserved spatial, molecular, and temporal events during definitive endoderm (DE). We find early FOXA2&#43;/TBXT-embryonic disc cells directly from DE, contrasting later-emerging FOXA2/TBXT&#43; node/notochord progenitors. Unlike mesoderm, none of these progenitors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. DE/Node fate hinges on balanced WNT and hypoblast-derived NODAL, which is extinguished upon DE differentiation. These findings emphasise the interplay between temporal and topological signalling in early fate decisions during gastrulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of 2x and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a lateral spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 {micro}m across an FOV of approximately 1.5 x 1.0 cm2. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hours, visualizing the movement of over 4.0 x 105 vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Muscle morphogenesis is a multi-step program, starting with myoblast fusion, followed by myotube-tendon attachment and sarcomere assembly, with subsequent sarcomere maturation, mitochondrial amplification and specialisation. The correct chronological order of these steps requires precise control of the transcriptional regulators and their effectors. How this regulation is achieved during muscle development is not well understood. In a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila, we identified the BTB-zinc finger protein Tono (CG32121) as a muscle-specific transcriptional regulator. tono mutant flight muscles display severe deficits in mitochondria and sarcomere maturation, resulting in uncontrolled contractile forces causing muscle atrophy during development. Tono protein is expressed during sarcomere maturation and localises in distinct condensates in flight muscle nuclei. Interestingly, internal pressure exerted by the maturing sarcomeres deforms the muscle nuclei into elongated shapes and changes the Tono condensates, suggesting that Tono senses the mechanical status of the muscle cells. Indeed, external mechanical pressure on the muscles triggers rapid liquid-liquid phase separation of Tono utilising its BTB domain. Thus, we propose that Tono senses high mechanical pressure to in turn adapt muscle transcription specifically at the sarcomere maturation stage. Consistently, tono mutant muscles display specific defects in a transcriptional switch that represses early muscle differentiation genes and boosts late ones. We hypothesise that a similar mechano-responsive regulation mechanism may control the activity of related BTB-zinc finger proteins that, if mutated, can result in uncontrolled force production in human muscle.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neocortex expansion during evolution is linked to higher numbers of neurons thought to result from increased proliferative capacity and neurogenic potential of basal progenitor cells (BPs) during development. Here we show that EREG, encoding the growth factor EPIREGULIN, is expressed in the human developing neocortex and in gorilla organoids, but not in the mouse neocortex. Addition of EPIREGULIN to the mouse neocortex increases proliferation of BPs via EGFR-mediated signaling, whereas ablation of EREG in human cortical organoids reduces BP proliferation. Addition of EPIREGULIN to cortical organoids promotes a further increase in proliferation of gorilla but not human BPs. Finally, we identify putative cis-regulatory elements that may contribute to inter-species differences in EREG expression. Overall, our results suggest that species-specific expression of EPIREGULIN may contribute to increased neocortex size in primates by providing a pro-proliferative signal to BPs in the subventricular zone progenitor niche.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Convergent extension (CE) is a fundamental morphogenetic process where oriented cell behaviors lead to polarized extension of diverse tissues. In vertebrates, regulation of CE requires both non-canonical Wnt, its co-receptor Ror, and &#34;core members&#34; of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP was originally identified as a mechanism to coordinate the cellular polarity in the plane of static epithelium, where core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/ Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/ Prickel (Pk) partition to opposing cell cortex. But how core PCP proteins interact with each other to mediate non-canonical Wnt/ Ror signaling during CE is not clear. We found previously that during CE, Vangl cell-autonomously recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane but simultaneously keeps Dvl inactive. In this study, we show that non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz. PK inhibits the transition, and functionally synergize with Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE. Conversely, Ror is required for the transition, and functionally antagonizes Vangl. Biochemically, Vangl interacts directly with both Ror and Dvl. Ror and Dvl do not bind directly, but can be cofractionated with Vangl. We propose that Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror from ectopically activating non-canonical Wnt signaling; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz for signaling activation upon non-canonical Wnt induced dimerization of Fz and Ror.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the trunk to tail transition the mammalian embryo builds the outlets for the intestinal and urogenital tracts, lays down the primordia for the hindlimb and external genitalia, and switches from the epiblast/primitive streak to the tailbud as the driver of axial extension. Genetic and molecular data indicate that Tgfbr1 is a key regulator of the trunk to tail transition. Tgfbr1 has been shown to control the switch of the neuro mesodermal-competent cells from the epiblast to the chordo-neural hinge to generate the tail bud. We now show that Tgfbr1 signaling also controls the remodeling of the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and of the embryonic endoderm associated with the trunk to tail transition. In the absence of Tgfbr1 the two LPM layers fail to converge at the end of the trunk, extending instead as separate layers enclosing the celomic cavity until the caudal embryonic extremity, lacking signs of the presence of primordia for the hindlimb or for external genitalia. However, this extended LPM, does not exhibit the molecular signatures characteristic of this tissue in the trunk. The vascular remodeling involving the dorsal aorta and the allantois artery leading to the connection between embryonic and extraembryonic circulation was also affected in the Tgfbr1 mutant embryos. Similar alterations in the LPM and vascular system were also observed in Isl1 null mutants, indicating that this factor acts in the regulatory cascade downstream of Tgfbr1 in LPM-derived tissues. In addition, in the absence of Tgfbr1 the embryonic endoderm fails to build the endodermal cloaca and to extend posteriorly to generate the tail gut. We present evidence suggesting that the remodeling activity of Tgfbr1 in the LPM and endoderm results from the control of the posterior primitive streak fate after its regression during the trunk to tail transition. Our data, together with previously published observations, place Tgfbr1 at the top of the regulatory processes controlling the trunk to tail transition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Aging and metabolic diseases are accompanied by systemic inflammation, but the mechanisms that induce this state are not known. We developed a human bone-marrow organoid system to explore mechanisms underlying metabolic-disease associated systemic inflammation. We find that a distinct type of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) develops in the adipose-rich, yellow bone marrow, which is known to gradually replace the hematopoietic red marrow as we age and during metabolic disease. Unlike HSCs derived from the red bone marrow, HSCs derived from the yellow bone marrow have higher proliferation rates, increase myeloid differentiation, skew towards pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage differentiation, and express a distinct transcriptomic profile associated with responsiveness to wounding. Yellow marrow-derived HSCs express higher levels of the leptin receptor, which we find to be further increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our work demonstrates that the human long bone yellow marrow is a niche for a distinct class of HSCs which could underlie hematopoietic dysfunction during aging and metabolic disease processes suggesting a shared inflammaging mechanism.</p>
