However, the molecular and tissue-level dynamics of the BM during morphogenesis and their functional significance remain largely unknown, especially in mammals, due to limited visualization tools. We developed knock-in mouse lines in which the endogenous collagen IV gene (Col4a2) was fused with a fluorescent tag. Through live imaging of developing hair follicles, we revealed a spatial gradient in the turnover rate of COL4A2 that is closely coupled with the BM expansion rate. The proliferation of epithelial progenitors coincided with the increased expansion of their underlying BM. Epithelial progenitors displaced with directionally expanding BM, but did not actively migrate on stable BM. The addition of a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor delayed the turnover of COL4A2, restrained the expansion of the BM, and induced a directional shift in the division angle of epithelial progenitors, altering the hair follicle morphology. Our findings revealed spatially distinct BM dynamics within the continuous epithelial BM and affirmed their significance in orchestrating the proliferation, movement and fate of progenitor cells, as well as the macro-level shape of organs during development.\nSpatially resolved proteomics of the stomatal lineage: polarity complexes for cell divisions and stomatal pores\nAuthors: Wallner, E.-S.; Mair, A.; Handler, D.; McWhite, C. D.; Xu, S.-L.; Dolan, L.; Bergmann, D.\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.03.564551\nCell polarity is used to guide asymmetric divisions and create morphologically diverse cells. We find that two oppositely oriented cortical polarity domains present during the asymmetric divisions in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage are reconfigured into polar domains marking ventral (pore-forming) and outward facing domains of maturing stomatal guard cells. Proteins that define these opposing polarity domains were used as baits in miniTurboID-based proximity labeling. Among differentially enriched proteins we find kinases, putative microtubule-interacting proteins, polar SOSEKIs with their effector ANGUSTIFOLIA, and using AI-facilitated protein structure prediction models, we identify their potential interaction interfaces. Functional and localization analysis of polarity protein OPL2 and its newly discovered partners suggest a positive interaction with mitotic microtubules and a potential role in cytokinesis. This combination of cutting-edge proteomics and structural modeling with live cell imaging provides insights into how polarity is rewired in different cell types and cell cycle stages.\nMulti-Step Cellular Control of Molecular Condensation by Microtubules in Early Oogenesis\nAuthors: Deis, R.; Kar, S.; Ahmad, A.; Bogoch, Y.; Dominitz, A.; Shvaizer, G.; Sasson, E.; Mytlis, A.; Ben-Zvi, A.; Elkouby, Y. M.\nScore: 21.9, Published: 2023-11-05 DOI: 10.1101/2022.03.11.484019\nThe Balbiani body (Bb) is a membraneless organelle that forms in oocytes from insects to humans. In most vertebrates the Bb contains essential RNA-protein (RNP) granules, establishes oocyte polarity, and is required embryogenesis and reproduction. In mammals the Bb is associated with primordial follicle formation. However, despite its discovery in 1845, the mechanisms of Bb formation are still unknown in any species. Here, we discovered mechanisms of Bb formation in zebrafish. We first provide three lines of live-imaging, molecular, and biochemical evidence in developing ovaries in-vivo to conclude that the Bb forms a molecular condensate. We show that Bb RNPs form insoluble complexes dependently on Buc, an intrinsically disordered protein with a functional prion-like domain, which is essential for Bb formation. By using in vivo live-imaging, FRAP experiments and genetics, we reveal that Bb condensation requires the early liquid-liquid phase-transition of Buc, which later progresses to liquid-solid phase-separation. Further, we uncovered multi-step regulation by microtubules in controlling Bb condensation: first, by direct dynein-mediated trafficking of early condensing Buc granules, then by scaffolding condensed granules likely via molecular crowding, and finally by caging the mature Bb to prevent its over-growth and coarsening, likely by a Pickering effect. These regulatory steps ensure the formation of a single Bb condensate, which is essential for oocyte polarization and development. Our work resolves the origins of embryonic polarity, and identifies molecular condensation as an overlooked phenomena in the developing vertebrate ovary. While phase-separation is often viewed as a self-assembly process, our work proposes a new paradigm for the regulation of molecular condensation widely in biology.\nPatterned embryonic invagination evolved in response to mechanical instability\nAuthors: Vellutini, B. C.; Cuenca, M. B.; Krishna, A.; Szałapak, A.; Modes, C. D.; Tomancak, P.\nScore: 52.6, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.30.534554\nMechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.\nMolecular basis for positional memory and its reprogrammability in limb regeneration\nAuthors: Otsuki, L.; Plattner, S. A.; Taniguchi-Sugiura, Y.; Tanaka, E. M.\nScore: 69.0, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564423\nUpon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.\nPiezo1 Mutant Zebrafish as a Model of Idiopathic Scoliosis\nAuthors: Ramli, ; Aramaki, T.; Watanabe, M.; Kondo, S.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-10-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563500\nScoliosis is a condition where the spine curves sideways, unique to humans due to their upright posture. However, the cause of this disease is not well understood because its challenging to find a model for experimentation. This study aimed to create a model for human idiopathic scoliosis by manipulating the function of mechanosensitive channels called Piezo channels in zebrafish. Zebrafish were chosen because they experience similar biomechanical forces to humans, particularly in relation to the role of mechanical force in scoliosis progression. Here we describe piezo1 and piezo2a are involved in bone formation, with a double knockout resulting in congenital systemic malformations. However, an in-frame mutation of piezo1 led to fully penetrant juvenile-onset scoliosis, bone asymmetry, reduced tissue mineral density, and abnormal intervertebral discs-resembling non-congenital scoliosis symptoms in humans. These findings suggest that functional Piezo channels responding to mechanical forces are crucial for bone formation and maintaining spine integrity, providing insights into skeletal disorders.\nSOX2+ sustentacular cells are stem cells of the postnatal adrenal medulla\nAuthors: Santambrogio, A.; Kemkem, Y.; Willis, T. L.; Berger, I.; Kastriti, M. E.; Faure, L.; Russell, J. P.; Lodge, E. J.; Yianni, V.; Oakey, R. J.; Altieri, B.; Bornstein, S. R.; Steenblock, C.; Adameyko, I. I.; Andoniadou, C. L.\nScore: 28.4, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.28.564519\nRenewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2+ cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2+ cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.\nIntegrated Proteomics Identifies Troponin I Isoform Switch as a Regulator of a Sarcomere-Metabolism Axis During Cardiac Regeneration\nAuthors: Aballo, T. J.; Bae, J.; Paltzer, W. G.; Chapman, E. A.; Salamon, R. J.; Mann, M. M.; Ge, Y.; Mahmoud, A. I.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-10-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.20.563389\nAdult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.\nEmerging cooperativity between Oct4 and Sox2 governs the pluripotency network in mouse embryos\nAuthors: Schöler, H. R.; Hou, Y.; Nie, Z.; Velychko, S.; Bedzhov, I.; Heising, S.; Jiang, Q.; Zhang, H.; Wu, G.; Adachi, K.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-10-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562912\nDuring the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.\nDivergent evolutionary strategies preempt tissue collision in fly gastrulation\nAuthors: Dey, B.; Kaul, V.; Kale, G.; Scorcelletti, M.; Takeda, M.; Wang, Y.-C.; Lemke, S.\nScore: 20.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.561568\nMetazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The precisely controlled remodelling of the basement membrane (BM) is considered vital for morphogenesis. However, the molecular and tissue-level dynamics of the BM during morphogenesis and their functional significance remain largely unknown, especially in mammals, due to limited visualization tools. We developed knock-in mouse lines in which the endogenous collagen IV gene (Col4a2) was fused with a fluorescent tag. Through live imaging of developing hair follicles, we revealed a spatial gradient in the turnover rate of COL4A2 that is closely coupled with the BM expansion rate. The proliferation of epithelial progenitors coincided with the increased expansion of their underlying BM. Epithelial progenitors displaced with directionally expanding BM, but did not actively migrate on stable BM. The addition of a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor delayed the turnover of COL4A2, restrained the expansion of the BM, and induced a directional shift in the division angle of epithelial progenitors, altering the hair follicle morphology. Our findings revealed spatially distinct BM dynamics within the continuous epithelial BM and affirmed their significance in orchestrating the proliferation, movement and fate of progenitor cells, as well as the macro-level shape of organs during development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell polarity is used to guide asymmetric divisions and create morphologically diverse cells. We find that two oppositely oriented cortical polarity domains present during the asymmetric divisions in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage are reconfigured into polar domains marking ventral (pore-forming) and outward facing domains of maturing stomatal guard cells. Proteins that define these opposing polarity domains were used as baits in miniTurboID-based proximity labeling. Among differentially enriched proteins we find kinases, putative microtubule-interacting proteins, polar SOSEKIs with their effector ANGUSTIFOLIA, and using AI-facilitated protein structure prediction models, we identify their potential interaction interfaces. Functional and localization analysis of polarity protein OPL2 and its newly discovered partners suggest a positive interaction with mitotic microtubules and a potential role in cytokinesis. This combination of cutting-edge proteomics and structural modeling with live cell imaging provides insights into how polarity is rewired in different cell types and cell cycle stages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Balbiani body (Bb) is a membraneless organelle that forms in oocytes from insects to humans. In most vertebrates the Bb contains essential RNA-protein (RNP) granules, establishes oocyte polarity, and is required embryogenesis and reproduction. In mammals the Bb is associated with primordial follicle formation. However, despite its discovery in 1845, the mechanisms of Bb formation are still unknown in any species. Here, we discovered mechanisms of Bb formation in zebrafish. We first provide three lines of live-imaging, molecular, and biochemical evidence in developing ovaries in-vivo to conclude that the Bb forms a molecular condensate. We show that Bb RNPs form insoluble complexes dependently on Buc, an intrinsically disordered protein with a functional prion-like domain, which is essential for Bb formation. By using in vivo live-imaging, FRAP experiments and genetics, we reveal that Bb condensation requires the early liquid-liquid phase-transition of Buc, which later progresses to liquid-solid phase-separation. Further, we uncovered multi-step regulation by microtubules in controlling Bb condensation: first, by direct dynein-mediated trafficking of early condensing Buc granules, then by scaffolding condensed granules likely via molecular crowding, and finally by caging the mature Bb to prevent its over-growth and coarsening, likely by a Pickering effect. These regulatory steps ensure the formation of a single Bb condensate, which is essential for oocyte polarization and development. Our work resolves the origins of embryonic polarity, and identifies molecular condensation as an overlooked phenomena in the developing vertebrate ovary. While phase-separation is often viewed as a self-assembly process, our work proposes a new paradigm for the regulation of molecular condensation widely in biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development. However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood. Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel buttonhead expression domain at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Upon limb amputation in salamanders, anterior and posterior connective tissue cells form distinct signalling centres that together fuel successful regeneration. The molecular properties that distinguish anterior and posterior cells prior to injury, which enable them to initiate different signalling centres after amputation, are not known. These anterior and posterior identities, crucial for regeneration, were thought to be established during development and to persist through successive regeneration cycles as positional memory. However, the molecular nature of these memory states and whether these identities can be engineered have remained outstanding questions. Here, we identify a positive feedback mechanism encoding posterior identity in the axolotl limb, which can be used to newly encode positional memory in regenerative cells. Posterior cells express residual levels of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 from development and this is a priming molecule necessary and sufficient to establish a Shh signalling centre after limb amputation. During regeneration, Shh feeds back and reinforces Hand2 expression in nearby cells. Hand2 is sustained following regeneration, safeguarding posterior memory, while Shh is shut off. As a consequence of this Hand2-Shh system, anterior and posterior identities are differentially susceptible to alteration. Posterior cells are stabilised against anteriorisation as their expression of Hand2 poises them to trigger the Hand2-Shh loop. In contrast, anterior cells can be reprogrammed: a transient exposure to Shh during regeneration causes anterior cells to gain Hand2 expression and a lasting competence to express Shh. In this way, regeneration is an opportunity and entry point to re-write positional memory. Our results implicate positive feedback in the stability of positional memory and explain why positional memory is more easily altered in one direction (anterior to posterior) than the other. Because modifying positional memory changes signalling outputs from regenerative cells, our findings have wider implications for tissue engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Scoliosis is a condition where the spine curves sideways, unique to humans due to their upright posture. However, the cause of this disease is not well understood because its challenging to find a model for experimentation. This study aimed to create a model for human idiopathic scoliosis by manipulating the function of mechanosensitive channels called Piezo channels in zebrafish. Zebrafish were chosen because they experience similar biomechanical forces to humans, particularly in relation to the role of mechanical force in scoliosis progression. Here we describe piezo1 and piezo2a are involved in bone formation, with a double knockout resulting in congenital systemic malformations. However, an in-frame mutation of piezo1 led to fully penetrant juvenile-onset scoliosis, bone asymmetry, reduced tissue mineral density, and abnormal intervertebral discs-resembling non-congenital scoliosis symptoms in humans. These findings suggest that functional Piezo channels responding to mechanical forces are crucial for bone formation and maintaining spine integrity, providing insights into skeletal disorders.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Renewal of the catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cell population of the adrenal medulla is necessary for physiological homeostasis throughout life. Definitive evidence for the presence or absence of an adrenomedullary stem cell has been enigmatic. In this work, we demonstrate that a subset of sustentacular cells endowed with a support role, are in fact adrenomedullary stem cells. Through genetic tracing and comprehensive transcriptomic data of the mouse adrenal medulla, we show that cells expressing Sox2/SOX2 specialise as a unique postnatal population from embryonic Schwann Cell Precursors and are also present in the normal adult human adrenal medulla. Postnatal SOX2&#43; cells give rise to chromaffin cells of both the adrenaline and noradrenaline lineages in vivo and in vitro. We reveal that SOX2&#43; stem cells have a second, paracrine role in maintaining adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis, where they promote proliferation through paracrine secretion of WNT6. This work identifies SOX2&#43; cells as a true stem cell for catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes have limited proliferative potential, and after myocardial infarction (MI), injured cardiac tissue is replaced with fibrotic scar rather than with functioning myocardium. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart possesses a regenerative capacity governed by cardiomyocyte proliferation; however, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal development results in loss of this regenerative capacity. Interestingly, a sarcomere isoform switch also takes place during postnatal development where slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) is replaced with cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we first employ integrated quantitative bottom-up and top-down proteomics to comprehensively define the proteomic and sarcomeric landscape during postnatal heart maturation. Utilizing a cardiomyocyte-specific ssTnI transgenic mouse model, we found that ssTnI overexpression increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and the cardiac regenerative capacity of the postnatal heart following MI compared to control mice by histological analysis. Our global proteomic analysis of ssTnI transgenic mice following MI reveals that ssTnI overexpression induces a significant shift in the cardiac proteomic landscape. This shift is characterized by an upregulation of key proteins involved in glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that the postnatal TnI isoform switch may play a role in the metabolic shift from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation during postnatal maturation. This underscores the significance of a sarcomere-metabolism axis during cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 are globally dispensable in morulae. Oct4 and Sox2 come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression, and they directly activate the pluripotency-related genes and the corresponding OCT-SOX enhancers. Sox2 KO failed to activate the ICM-specific pluripotency-related genes while overexpression of Sox2 prematurely upregulated these genes in morulae, suggesting that Sox2 acts as a limiting factor for inducing the pluripotent network. Our study provides new insights into this critical process of mouse preimplantation development at molecular levels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures. In the early embryonic stages, morphogenetic processes involving growth and deformation occur concurrently. Forces generated in one tissue can thus increase mechanical stress in the neighboring tissue, potentially disrupting spatial patterning, morphological robustness, and consequently decreasing organismal fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to reduce or release inter-tissue stresses remains poorly understood. Here we combined phylogenetic survey across a whole insect order (Diptera), quantitative live imaging, and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate the evolution of mechanical stress management during epithelial expansions in the gastrulating fly embryos. We find that two distinct cellular mechanisms exist in Diptera to prevent the accumulation of compressive stress that can arise when the expanding head and trunk tissues collide. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic dipteran subgroup including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the head-trunk boundary undergoes active out-of-plane deformation to form a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow (CF), which acts as a mechanical sink to preempt head-trunk collision. Genetic or optogenetic elimination of the CF leads to tissue buckling, yielding deleterious effects of axial distortion that likely results from unmitigated release of compressive stress. Non-cyclorrhaphan flies, by contrast, lack CF formation and instead display widespread out-of-plane division in the head, which shortens the duration of its expansion and reduces surface area increase. Reorienting head mitosis in Drosophila from in-plane to out-of-plane partially suppresses the need for epithelial out-of-plane deformation, suggesting that out-of-plane division can act as an alternative mechanical sink to prevent tissue collision. Our data suggest that programs of mechanical stress management can emerge abruptly under selective pressure of inter-tissue mechanical conflict in early embryonic development.</p>
