M.; Murawala, P.\nScore: 22.6, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.577464\nPrimary body axis development is a highly conserved process that proceeds through somitogenesis and further subdivision into dermatome, myotome, and sclerotome. Defects in somitic-clock genes such as Hes7 lead to vertebral segmentation defects in mice and fish. Here we show that in the axolotl, Hes7 is also necessary for proper embryonic vertebral segmentation but is, surprisingly, dispensable during axolotl tail regeneration. Using genetic barcoding and fate mapping we found that during regeneration, the somitic derivatives (muscle, cartilage, tendon, fibroblasts) arose from tendon-like, Lfng+multi-potent stem cells residing at the myotendonal junction that we term \"asomitic stem cells\". Throughout homeostasis and regeneration these stem cells display a distinct gene regulatory state compared to developmental progenitors with comparable lineage potential. These observations contrast to axolotl limb regeneration that proceeds via fibroblast dedifferentiation and the subsequent recapitulation of a limb developmental program. Taken together our research shows that divergent strategies are deployed between limb and tail regeneration, and that regeneration of complex body parts does not necessarily involve the complete redeployment of developmental programs.\nA Comprehensive Human Embryogenesis Reference Tool using Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data\nAuthors: Zhao, C.; Plaza Reyes, A.; Schell, J. P.; Weltner, J.; Ortega, N.; Zheng, Y.; Bjorklund, A. K.; Baque-Vidal, L.; Sokka, J.; Trokovic, R.; Cox, B.

The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.\nA feather star is born: embryonic development and nervous system organization in the crinoid Antedon mediterranea\nAuthors: Mercurio, S.; Gattoni, G.; Scari, G.; Ascagni, M.; Barzaghi, B.; Elphick, M. R.; Benito-Gutierrez, E.; Pennati, R.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577964\nBackgroundCrinoids belong to the phylum Echinodermata, marine invertebrates with a highly derived pentaradial body plan. As the only living members of the Pelmatozoa, the sister group to other extant echinoderms, crinoids are in a key phylogenetic position to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this phylum. However, the development of crinoids has been scarcely investigated, limiting their potential for comparative studies. Many crinoids are difficult to collect in the wild and embryo manipulation is challenging. Conversely, the Mediterranean feather star Antedon mediterranea can be found in shallow waters and has been used for experimental studies, most notably to investigate regeneration. ResultsThe aim here was to establish A. mediterranea as an experimental system for developmental biology. To accomplish this, we set up a method for culturing embryos in vitro from zygote to hatching larva stage that allowed us to define a developmental timeline and a standardized staging system for this species. We then optimized protocols to characterize the development of the main structures of the feather star body plan, using a combination of microscopy techniques and whole mount immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization chain reaction. Focusing on the nervous system, we show that the larval apical organ includes a combination of serotonergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that form under the influence of a conserved anterior molecular signature. The larval neural plexus is instead composed of glutamatergic neurons and develops during the formation of the ciliary bands. Larval neurons disappear at metamorphosis, and the ectoneural and entoneural components of the adult nervous system develop early in post-metamorphic stages. Furthermore, the oral ectoderm that contains the ectoneural system acquires an \"anterior\" signature expressing Six3/6 and Lhx2/9 orthologs. ConclusionsOur results deepen our knowledge on crinoid development and provide new techniques to investigate feather star embryogenesis, promoting the use of A. mediterranea in developmental and evolutionary biology. This in turn will pave the way for the inclusion of crinoids in comparative studies to understand the origin of the echinoderm body plan and clarify many unanswered questions on deuterostome evolution.\nSuppression of ERK signalling promotes pluripotent epiblast in the human blastocyst\nAuthors: Simon, C. S.; McCarthy, A.; Woods, L.; Staneva, D.; Huang, Q.; Linneberg-Agerholm, M.; Faulkner, A.; Papathanasiou, A.; Elder, K.; Snell, P.; Christie, L.; Garcia, P.; Shaikly, V.; Taranissi, M.; Choudhary, M.; Herbert, M.; Brickman, J. M.; Niakan, K. K.\nScore: 17.4, Published: 2024-02-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578414\nStudies in the mouse demonstrate the importance of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and extra-cellular receptor tyrosine kinase (ERK) in specification of embryo-fated epiblast and yolk-sac-fated hypoblast cells from uncommitted inner cell mass (ICM) cells prior to implantation. Molecular mechanisms regulating specification of early lineages in human development are comparatively unclear. Here we show that exogenous FGF stimulation leads to expanded hypoblast molecular marker expression, at the expense of the epiblast. Conversely, we show that specifically inhibiting ERK activity leads to expansion of epiblast cells functionally capable of giving rise to naive human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicates that these epiblast cells downregulate FGF signalling and upregulate molecular markers associated with naive pluripotency. Our functional study demonstrates for the first time the molecular mechanisms governing ICM specification in human development, whereby segregation of the epiblast and hypoblast lineages occurs during maturation of the mammalian embryo in an ERK signal-dependent manner.\nHarnessing the regenerative potential of interleukin11 to enhance heart repair\nAuthors: Shin, K.; Rodriguez-Parks, A.; Xia, Y.; Dong, C.; Kelles, S.; Cao, J.; Kang, J.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577788\nBalancing between regenerative processes and fibrosis is crucial for heart repair1. However, strategies to regulate the balance between these two process are a barrier to the development of effective therapies for heart regeneration. While Interleukin 11 (IL11) is known as a fibrotic factor for the heart2-4, its contribution to heart regeneration remains poorly understood. Here, we uncovered that il11a can initiate robust regenerative programs in the zebrafish heart, including cell cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and coronary expansion, even in the absence of injury. However, the prolonged il11a induction in uninjured hearts causes persistent fibroblast emergence, resulting in cardiac fibrosis. While deciphering the regenerative and fibrotic effects, we found that il11-dependent fibrosis, but not il11-dependent regeneration, is mediated through ERK activity, implying that the dual effects of il11a on regeneration and fibrosis can be uncoupled. To harness the regenerative ability of il11a for injured hearts, we devised a combinatorial treatment through il11a induction with ERK inhibition. Using this approach, we observed enhanced CM proliferation with mitigated fibrosis, achieving a balance between stimulating regenerative processes and curbing fibrotic outcomes. Thus, our findings unveil the mechanistic insights into regenerative roles of il11 signaling, offering the potential therapeutic avenues that utilizes a paracrine regenerative factor to foster cardiac repair without exacerbating the fibrotic responses.\nHepatoblast iterative apicobasal polarization is regulated by extracellular matrix remodeling\nAuthors: Delpierre, J.; Valenzuela, J. I.; Bovyn, M.; Martins, N. P.; Belicova, L.; Repnik, U.; Bebelman, M.; Seifert, S.; Haas, P. A.; Kalaidzidis, Y. L.; Zerial, M.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578046\nHepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.\nA TBX5-dependent compartment boundary patterns the cardiac interventricular septum\nAuthors: Kathiriya, I. S.; Dominguez, M. H.; Rao, K. S.; Muncie-Vasic, J. M.; Devine, W. P.; Hu, K. M.; Hota, S. K.; Garay, B. I.; Quintero, D.; Goyal, P.; Matthews, M. N.; Thomas, R.; Sukonnik, T.; Miguel-Perez, D.; Winchester, S.; Brower, E. F.; Forjaz, A.; Wu, P.-H.; Wirtz, D.; Kiemen, A. L.; Bruneau, B. G.\nScore: 12.3, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578995\nFailure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.\nHost response during unresolved urinary tract infection alters mammary tissue homeostasis through collagen deposition and TIMP1\nAuthors: Henry, S.; Lewis, S. M.; Cyrill, S. L.; Callaway, M. K.; Chatterjee, D.; Somasundara, A. V. H.; Jones, G.; He, X. Y.; Caligiuri, G.; Ciccone, M. F.; Diaz, I. A.; Biswas, A.; Hernandez, E.; Ha, T.; Wilkinson, J. E.; EGEBLAD, M.; Tuveson, D.; Dos Santos, C. O.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2024-02-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578977\nExposure to pathogens throughout a lifetime influences immunity and organ function. Here, we explored how the systemic host-response to bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) induces tissue-specific alterations to the mammary gland. Utilizing a combination of histological tissue analysis, single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we identified that mammary tissue from UTI-bearing mice display collagen deposition, enlarged ductal structures, ductal hyperplasia with atypical epithelial transcriptomes and altered immune composition. Bacterial cells were absent in the mammary tissue and blood of UTI-bearing mice, therefore, alterations to the distal mammary tissue were mediated by the systemic host response to local infection. Furthermore, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment resolved the infection and restored mammary cellular and tissue homeostasis. Systemically, unresolved UTI correlated with increased plasma levels of the metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP1, which controls extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neutrophil function. Treatment of nulliparous and post-lactation UTI-bearing female mice with a TIMP1 neutralizing antibody, or broad-spectrum antibiotic, prevented mammary collagen deposition, thus providing evidence for an unexpected link between the systemic host response during UTI and mammary alterations.\nSoma-to-germline BMP signal is essential for Drosophila spermiogenesis\nAuthors: Beard, E. K.; Norris, R. P.; Furusho, M.; Terasaki, M.; Inaba, M.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578090\nIn the Drosophila testis, developing germ cells are encapsulated by somatic support cells throughout development. Soma-germline interactions are essential for successful spermiogenesis. However, it is still not fully understood what signaling events take place between the soma and the germline. In this study, we found that a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand, Glass bottom boat (Gbb), secreted from somatic cyst cells (CCs), signals to differentiating germ cells to maintain proper spermiogenesis. Knockdown of Gbb in CCs or the type I BMP receptor Saxophone (Sax) in germ cells leads to a defect in sperm head bundling and decreased fertility. Our Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the mutant germ cells have aberrant morphology of mitochondria throughout the stages of spermiogenesis and exhibit a defect in nebenkern formation. Elongating spermatids show uncoupled nuclei and elongating mitochondrial derivatives, suggesting that improper mitochondrial development may cause the sperm bundling defect. Taken together we propose a new role of soma-derived BMP signaling, which is essential for spermiogenesis.\nA new genetically tractable non-vertebrate system to study complete camera-type eye regeneration\nAuthors: Accorsi, A.; Pardo, B.; Ross, E.; Corbin, T. J.; McClain, M.; Weaver, K.; Delventhal, K.; Morrison, J. A.; McKinney, M. C.; McKinney, S. A.; Sanchez Alvarado, A.\nScore: 82.2, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577494\nCamera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Primary body axis development is a highly conserved process that proceeds through somitogenesis and further subdivision into dermatome, myotome, and sclerotome. Defects in somitic-clock genes such as Hes7 lead to vertebral segmentation defects in mice and fish. Here we show that in the axolotl, Hes7 is also necessary for proper embryonic vertebral segmentation but is, surprisingly, dispensable during axolotl tail regeneration. Using genetic barcoding and fate mapping we found that during regeneration, the somitic derivatives (muscle, cartilage, tendon, fibroblasts) arose from tendon-like, Lfng&#43;multi-potent stem cells residing at the myotendonal junction that we term &#34;asomitic stem cells&#34;. Throughout homeostasis and regeneration these stem cells display a distinct gene regulatory state compared to developmental progenitors with comparable lineage potential. These observations contrast to axolotl limb regeneration that proceeds via fibroblast dedifferentiation and the subsequent recapitulation of a limb developmental program. Taken together our research shows that divergent strategies are deployed between limb and tail regeneration, and that regeneration of complex body parts does not necessarily involve the complete redeployment of developmental programs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Stem cell-based embryo models offer unprecedented experimental tools for studying early human development. The usefulness of embryo models hinges on their molecular, cellular and structural fidelities to their in vivo counterparts. To authenticate human embryo models, single-cell RNA-sequencing has been utilised for unbiased transcriptional profiling. However, a well-organised and integrated human single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, serving as a universal reference for benchmarking human embryo models, remains unavailable. Herein, we developed such a reference, through integration of six published human datasets covering developmental stages from the zygote to the gastrula. Lineage annotations are contrasted and validated with available human and non-human primate datasets. Using stabilised UMAP we constructed a web tool, where query datasets can be projected on the reference and annotated with predicted cell identities. Using this reference tool, we examined several recent human embryo models, highlighting the risk of misannotation when relevant references are lacking.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundCrinoids belong to the phylum Echinodermata, marine invertebrates with a highly derived pentaradial body plan. As the only living members of the Pelmatozoa, the sister group to other extant echinoderms, crinoids are in a key phylogenetic position to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this phylum. However, the development of crinoids has been scarcely investigated, limiting their potential for comparative studies. Many crinoids are difficult to collect in the wild and embryo manipulation is challenging. Conversely, the Mediterranean feather star Antedon mediterranea can be found in shallow waters and has been used for experimental studies, most notably to investigate regeneration.

ResultsThe aim here was to establish A. mediterranea as an experimental system for developmental biology. To accomplish this, we set up a method for culturing embryos in vitro from zygote to hatching larva stage that allowed us to define a developmental timeline and a standardized staging system for this species. We then optimized protocols to characterize the development of the main structures of the feather star body plan, using a combination of microscopy techniques and whole mount immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization chain reaction. Focusing on the nervous system, we show that the larval apical organ includes a combination of serotonergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that form under the influence of a conserved anterior molecular signature. The larval neural plexus is instead composed of glutamatergic neurons and develops during the formation of the ciliary bands. Larval neurons disappear at metamorphosis, and the ectoneural and entoneural components of the adult nervous system develop early in post-metamorphic stages. Furthermore, the oral ectoderm that contains the ectoneural system acquires an &#34;anterior&#34; signature expressing Six3/6 and Lhx2/9 orthologs.

ConclusionsOur results deepen our knowledge on crinoid development and provide new techniques to investigate feather star embryogenesis, promoting the use of A. mediterranea in developmental and evolutionary biology. This in turn will pave the way for the inclusion of crinoids in comparative studies to understand the origin of the echinoderm body plan and clarify many unanswered questions on deuterostome evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studies in the mouse demonstrate the importance of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and extra-cellular receptor tyrosine kinase (ERK) in specification of embryo-fated epiblast and yolk-sac-fated hypoblast cells from uncommitted inner cell mass (ICM) cells prior to implantation. Molecular mechanisms regulating specification of early lineages in human development are comparatively unclear. Here we show that exogenous FGF stimulation leads to expanded hypoblast molecular marker expression, at the expense of the epiblast. Conversely, we show that specifically inhibiting ERK activity leads to expansion of epiblast cells functionally capable of giving rise to naive human pluripotent stem cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicates that these epiblast cells downregulate FGF signalling and upregulate molecular markers associated with naive pluripotency. Our functional study demonstrates for the first time the molecular mechanisms governing ICM specification in human development, whereby segregation of the epiblast and hypoblast lineages occurs during maturation of the mammalian embryo in an ERK signal-dependent manner.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Balancing between regenerative processes and fibrosis is crucial for heart repair1. However, strategies to regulate the balance between these two process are a barrier to the development of effective therapies for heart regeneration. While Interleukin 11 (IL11) is known as a fibrotic factor for the heart2-4, its contribution to heart regeneration remains poorly understood. Here, we uncovered that il11a can initiate robust regenerative programs in the zebrafish heart, including cell cycle reentry of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and coronary expansion, even in the absence of injury. However, the prolonged il11a induction in uninjured hearts causes persistent fibroblast emergence, resulting in cardiac fibrosis. While deciphering the regenerative and fibrotic effects, we found that il11-dependent fibrosis, but not il11-dependent regeneration, is mediated through ERK activity, implying that the dual effects of il11a on regeneration and fibrosis can be uncoupled. To harness the regenerative ability of il11a for injured hearts, we devised a combinatorial treatment through il11a induction with ERK inhibition. Using this approach, we observed enhanced CM proliferation with mitigated fibrosis, achieving a balance between stimulating regenerative processes and curbing fibrotic outcomes. Thus, our findings unveil the mechanistic insights into regenerative roles of il11 signaling, offering the potential therapeutic avenues that utilizes a paracrine regenerative factor to foster cardiac repair without exacerbating the fibrotic responses.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hepatocytes have a unique multiaxial polarity with several apical and basal surfaces. The prevailing model for the emergence of this multipolarity and the coordination of lumen formation between adjacent hepatocytes is based on asymmetric cell division. Here, investigating polarity generation in liver cell progenitors, the hepatoblasts, during liver development in vivo and in vitro, we found that this model cannot explain the observed dynamics of apical lumen formation in the embryonic liver. Instead, we identified a new mechanism of multi-axial polarization: We found that polarization can be initiated in a cell-autonomous manner by re-positioning apical recycling endosomes (AREs) to the cell cortex via fibronectin sensing through Integrin V. Using live cell imaging we showed that this process repeats, leading to multiaxial polarity independently of cell division. We found that establishment of oriented trafficking leads to secretion of the metalloprotease MMP13, allowing neighboring hepatoblasts to synchronize their polarization by sensing extracellular matrix (ECM) distribution and enabling lumen opening. Finally, active remodeling of ECM in proximity of nascent apical surfaces closes a positive feedback loop of polarization, whereas disruption of this loop by either blocking MMP13 or downregulating Integrin V prevents formation of the bile canaliculi network. Integration of this feedback loop into a simple mathematical model reproduces the observed dynamics of bile canaliculi network formation during liver development quantitatively. Our combined findings thus suggest a new mechanism of polarization coupling to self-organization at the tissue scale.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Failure of septation of the interventricular septum (IVS) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), but mechanisms for patterning the IVS are largely unknown. We show that a Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitor lineage forms a compartment boundary bisecting the IVS. This coordinated population originates at a first- and second heart field interface, subsequently forming a morphogenetic nexus. Ablation of Tbx5&#43;/Mef2cAHF&#43; progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia, and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects including Slit2 and Ntn1 misexpression. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify essential cues that direct progenitors to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing new mechanisms for cardiac birth defects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exposure to pathogens throughout a lifetime influences immunity and organ function. Here, we explored how the systemic host-response to bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) induces tissue-specific alterations to the mammary gland. Utilizing a combination of histological tissue analysis, single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we identified that mammary tissue from UTI-bearing mice display collagen deposition, enlarged ductal structures, ductal hyperplasia with atypical epithelial transcriptomes and altered immune composition. Bacterial cells were absent in the mammary tissue and blood of UTI-bearing mice, therefore, alterations to the distal mammary tissue were mediated by the systemic host response to local infection. Furthermore, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment resolved the infection and restored mammary cellular and tissue homeostasis. Systemically, unresolved UTI correlated with increased plasma levels of the metalloproteinase inhibitor, TIMP1, which controls extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neutrophil function. Treatment of nulliparous and post-lactation UTI-bearing female mice with a TIMP1 neutralizing antibody, or broad-spectrum antibiotic, prevented mammary collagen deposition, thus providing evidence for an unexpected link between the systemic host response during UTI and mammary alterations.</p>

Soma-germline interactions are essential for successful spermiogenesis. However, it is still not fully understood what signaling events take place between the soma and the germline. In this study, we found that a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligand, Glass bottom boat (Gbb), secreted from somatic cyst cells (CCs), signals to differentiating germ cells to maintain proper spermiogenesis. Knockdown of Gbb in CCs or the type I BMP receptor Saxophone (Sax) in germ cells leads to a defect in sperm head bundling and decreased fertility. Our Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the mutant germ cells have aberrant morphology of mitochondria throughout the stages of spermiogenesis and exhibit a defect in nebenkern formation. Elongating spermatids show uncoupled nuclei and elongating mitochondrial derivatives, suggesting that improper mitochondrial development may cause the sperm bundling defect. Taken together we propose a new role of soma-derived BMP signaling, which is essential for spermiogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Camera-type eyes are complex sensory organs susceptible to irreversible damage. Their repair is difficult to study due to the paucity of camera-type eye regeneration models. Identifying a genetically tractable organism with the ability to fully regenerate complete camera-type eyes would help overcome this difficulty. Here, we introduce the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, capable of full regeneration of camera-type eyes even after complete resection. We defined anatomical components of P. canaliculata eyes and genes expressed during crucial steps of their regeneration. By exploiting the unique features of this organism, we successfully established the first stable mutant lines in apple snails. Our studies revealed that, akin to humans, pax6 is indispensable for eye development in apple snails, establishing this as a research organism to unravel the mechanisms of camera-type eye regeneration. This work expands our understanding of complex sensory organ regeneration and offers new ways to explore this process.</p>
