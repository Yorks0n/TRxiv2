C. o.; Li, M.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573770\nHuman naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) can differentiate into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), a critical step in the generation of the integrated embryo model termed blastoid. The current paradigm of blastoid generation necessitates the aggregation of dozens of nPSCs treated with multiple small molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or genetic modifications to initiate TE differentiation. The presence of complex crosstalk among pathways and cellular heterogeneity in these models complicates mechanistic study and genetic screens. Here, we show that a single small molecule, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potently induces TE differentiation in basal medium without pharmacological and genetic perturbations. DMSO enhances blastoid generation and, more importantly, is sufficient for blastoid generation by itself. DMSO blastoids resemble blastocysts in morphology and lineage composition. DMSO induces blastoid formation through PKC signaling and cell cycle regulation. Lastly, DMSO enables single nPSC-derived clonal blastoids, which could facilitate genetic screens for mechanistic understanding of human embryogenesis.\nCooperation between Nodal and FGF signals regulates zebrafish cardiac cell migration and heart morphogenesis\nAuthors: Gonzalez, V.; Grant, M. G.; Suzuki, M.; Christophers, B.; Williams, J. R.; Burdine, R. D.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-06 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574380\nAsymmetric vertebrate heart development is driven by an intricate sequence of morphogenetic cell movements, the coordination of which requires precise interpretation of signaling cues by heart primordia. Here we show that Nodal functions cooperatively with FGF during heart tube formation and asymmetric placement. Both pathways act as migratory stimuli for cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but FGF is dispensable for directing heart tube asymmetry, which is governed by Nodal. We further find that Nodal controls CPC migration by inducing left-right asymmetries in the formation of actin-based protrusions in CPCs. Additionally, we define a developmental window in which FGF signals are required for proper heart looping and show cooperativity between FGF and Nodal in this process. We present evidence FGF may promote heart looping through addition of the secondary heart field. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of FGF signaling affects proper development of the atrioventricular canal (AVC), which likely contributes to abnormal chamber morphologies in FGF-deficient hearts. Together, our data shed insight into how the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling cues regulate the cellular behaviors underlying organ morphogenesis.\nLoss of αBa-crystallin, but not αA-crystallin, increases age-related cataract in the zebrafish lens\nAuthors: Posner, M.; Garver, T.; Kaye, T.; Brdicka, S.; Suttle, M.; Patterson, B.; Farnsworth, D. R.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2024-01-04 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574085\nThe vertebrate eye lens is an unusual organ in that most of its cells lack nuclei and the ability to replace aging protein. The small heat shock protein -crystallins evolved to become key components of this lens, possibly because of their ability to prevent aggregation of aging protein that would otherwise lead to lens opacity. Most vertebrates express two -crystallins, A- and B-crystallin, and mutations in each are linked to human cataract. In a mouse knockout model only the loss of A-crystallin led to early-stage lens cataract. We have used the zebrafish as a model system to investigate the role of -crystallins during lens development. Interestingly, while zebrafish express one lens-specific A-crystallin gene (cryaa), they express two B-crystallin genes, with one evolving lens specificity (cryaba) and the other retaining the broad expression of its mammalian ortholog (cryabb). In this study we used individual mutant zebrafish lines for all three -crystallin genes to determine the impact of their loss on age-related cataract. Surprisingly, unlike mouse knockout models, we found that the loss of the Ba-crystallin gene cryaba led to an increase in lens opacity compared to cryaa null fish at 24 months of age. Loss of A-crystallin did not increase the prevalence of cataract. We also used single cell RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR data to show a shift in the lens expression of zebrafish -crystallins between 5 and 10 days post fertilization (dpf), with 5 and 6 dpf lenses expressing cryaa almost exclusively, and expression of cryaba and cryabb becoming more prominent after 10 dpf. These data show that cryaa is the primary -crystallin during early lens development, while the protective role for cryaba becomes more important during lens aging. This study is the first to quantify cataract prevalence in wild-type zebrafish, showing that lens opacities develop in approximately 25% of fish by 18 months of age. None of the three -crystallin mutants showed a compensatory increase in the expression of the remaining two crystallins, or in the abundant {beta}B1-crystallin. Overall, these findings indicate an ontogenetic shift in the functional importance of individual -crystallins during zebrafish lens development. Our finding that the lens-specific zebrafish Ba-crystallin plays the leading role in preventing age-related cataract adds a new twist to our understanding of vertebrate lens evolution.\nMaternal gut Bifidobacterium breve modifies fetal brain metabolism in mice\nAuthors: Lopez-Tello, J.; Kiu, R.; Schofield, Z.; van Sinderen, D.; Le Gall, G.; Hall, L. J.; Sferruzzi-Perri, A.\nScore: 2.5, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573756\nIn recent years, our understanding of the gut microbiomes impact on host physiology and metabolism has grown exponentially. Yet, the specific role of certain microorganisms in regulating gestational health and fetal development remains largely unexplored. During pregnancy, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus that provides multiple benefits, including changes in placental development and fetal glycaemia. In this study, using germ-free mice colonized with or without Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 during pregnancy, we demonstrated that this bacterium is important for controlling fetal brain metabolism. In particular, presence of maternal Bifidobacterium led to reduced levels of ten metabolites (including citrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and carnitine) in the fetal brain, with concurrent elevated abundance of transporters involved in glucose and branched-chain amino acid uptake. B. breve supplementation was also associated with increased expression of critical metabolic and cellular pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, AMPK, STAT5 and Wnt-{beta}-catenin (including its receptor Frizzled-7) in the fetal brain. Furthermore, maternal-associated Bifidobacterium resulted in HIF-2 protein stabilization and altered a number of genes and proteins involved in cellular growth, axogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These findings highlight that Bifidobacterium breve colonisation of the maternal gut is important for the metabolism and growth of the fetal brain.\nGene module reconstruction elucidates cellular differentiation processes and the regulatory logic of specialized secretion\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Liu, J.; Du, L. Y.; Wyss, J. L.; Farrell, J. A.; Schier, A. F.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.573643\nDuring differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system - the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.\nLearning a conserved mechanism for early neuroectoderm morphogenesis\nAuthors: Lefebvre, M. F.; Colen, J.; Claussen, N. H.; Brauns, F.; Raich, M. K.; Mitchell, N.; Fruchart, M.; Vitelli, V.; Streichan, S. J.\nScore: 10.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573058\nMorphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.\nDihydroceramide desaturase governs endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet homeostasis to promote glial function in the nervous system\nAuthors: Zhu, Y.; Cho, K.; Lacin, H.; Zhu, Y.; DiPaola, J.; Wilson, B. A.; Patti, G. J.; Skeath, J. B.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.01.573836\nDihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides in the last step of the de novo ceramide pathway. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function in humans leads to the rare neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18, but the exact mechanism that underlies the disease remains unclear. Through a forward genetic screen, we discovered that infertile crescent (ifc), the sole Drosophila dihydroceramide desaturase, governs central nervous system development and morphology. Expressed and genetically active most prominently in glia rather than neurons, ifc primarily controls nervous system development through a cell autonomous function in glia. Within the nervous system, loss of ifc results in ceramide depletion, dihydroceramide accumulation, and increased saturation of major membrane phospholipids. At the cellular level, loss of ifc leads to severe glial defects, particularly in cortex glia, including expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, cell swelling, failure to enwrap neurons, and lipid droplet depletion. Our research supports a model in which inappropriate retention of dihydroceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of glial cells drives ER expansion and cell swelling, disrupting glial function and leading to subsequent nervous system dysfunction. Given the conserved nature of the de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway, our findings in the fly system suggest that dihydroceramide-triggered expansion of the ER in the membrane-rich glial cells may be the proximal cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 in humans.\nCell density couples tissue mechanics to control the elongation speed of the body axis\nAuthors: Lu, C.; Vidigueira, J. M. N.; Jie, C. C. J.; Maksymiuk, A.; Xiong, F.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.573670\nThe vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation1-3. Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock4. As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size5,6 or elongation progress7,8, the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy9 on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.\nSingle-cell transcriptional dynamics in a living vertebrate\nAuthors: Eck, E.; Moretti, B.; Schlomann, B. H.; Bragantini, J.; Lange, M.; Zhao, X.; VijayKumar, S.; Valentin, G.; Loureiro, C.; Soroldoni, D.; Royer, L. A.; Oates, A. C.; Garcia, H. H.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.03.574108\nThe ability to quantify transcriptional dynamics in individual cells via live imaging has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation. However, such measurements are lacking in the context of vertebrate embryos. We addressed this deficit by applying MS2-MCP mRNA labeling to the quantification of transcription in zebrafish, a model vertebrate. We developed a platform of transgenic organisms, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and optimized image analysis that enables visualization and quantification of MS2 reporters. We used these tools to obtain the first single-cell, real-time measurements of transcriptional dynamics of the segmentation clock. Our measurements challenge the traditional view of smooth clock oscillations and instead suggest a model of discrete transcriptional bursts that are organized in space and time. Together, these results highlight how measuring single-cell transcriptional activity can reveal unexpected features of gene regulation and how this data can fuel the dialogue between theory and experiment.\nSteroid signaling controls sex-specific development in an invertebrate\nAuthors: Grmai, L.; Jimenez, E.; Baxter, K.; Van Doren, M.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573099\nIn vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Human naive pluripotent stem cells (nPSCs) can differentiate into extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), a critical step in the generation of the integrated embryo model termed blastoid. The current paradigm of blastoid generation necessitates the aggregation of dozens of nPSCs treated with multiple small molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or genetic modifications to initiate TE differentiation. The presence of complex crosstalk among pathways and cellular heterogeneity in these models complicates mechanistic study and genetic screens. Here, we show that a single small molecule, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), potently induces TE differentiation in basal medium without pharmacological and genetic perturbations. DMSO enhances blastoid generation and, more importantly, is sufficient for blastoid generation by itself. DMSO blastoids resemble blastocysts in morphology and lineage composition. DMSO induces blastoid formation through PKC signaling and cell cycle regulation. Lastly, DMSO enables single nPSC-derived clonal blastoids, which could facilitate genetic screens for mechanistic understanding of human embryogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Asymmetric vertebrate heart development is driven by an intricate sequence of morphogenetic cell movements, the coordination of which requires precise interpretation of signaling cues by heart primordia. Here we show that Nodal functions cooperatively with FGF during heart tube formation and asymmetric placement. Both pathways act as migratory stimuli for cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), but FGF is dispensable for directing heart tube asymmetry, which is governed by Nodal. We further find that Nodal controls CPC migration by inducing left-right asymmetries in the formation of actin-based protrusions in CPCs. Additionally, we define a developmental window in which FGF signals are required for proper heart looping and show cooperativity between FGF and Nodal in this process. We present evidence FGF may promote heart looping through addition of the secondary heart field. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of FGF signaling affects proper development of the atrioventricular canal (AVC), which likely contributes to abnormal chamber morphologies in FGF-deficient hearts. Together, our data shed insight into how the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling cues regulate the cellular behaviors underlying organ morphogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate eye lens is an unusual organ in that most of its cells lack nuclei and the ability to replace aging protein. The small heat shock protein -crystallins evolved to become key components of this lens, possibly because of their ability to prevent aggregation of aging protein that would otherwise lead to lens opacity. Most vertebrates express two -crystallins, A- and B-crystallin, and mutations in each are linked to human cataract. In a mouse knockout model only the loss of A-crystallin led to early-stage lens cataract. We have used the zebrafish as a model system to investigate the role of -crystallins during lens development. Interestingly, while zebrafish express one lens-specific A-crystallin gene (cryaa), they express two B-crystallin genes, with one evolving lens specificity (cryaba) and the other retaining the broad expression of its mammalian ortholog (cryabb). In this study we used individual mutant zebrafish lines for all three -crystallin genes to determine the impact of their loss on age-related cataract. Surprisingly, unlike mouse knockout models, we found that the loss of the Ba-crystallin gene cryaba led to an increase in lens opacity compared to cryaa null fish at 24 months of age. Loss of A-crystallin did not increase the prevalence of cataract. We also used single cell RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR data to show a shift in the lens expression of zebrafish -crystallins between 5 and 10 days post fertilization (dpf), with 5 and 6 dpf lenses expressing cryaa almost exclusively, and expression of cryaba and cryabb becoming more prominent after 10 dpf. These data show that cryaa is the primary -crystallin during early lens development, while the protective role for cryaba becomes more important during lens aging. This study is the first to quantify cataract prevalence in wild-type zebrafish, showing that lens opacities develop in approximately 25% of fish by 18 months of age. None of the three -crystallin mutants showed a compensatory increase in the expression of the remaining two crystallins, or in the abundant {beta}B1-crystallin. Overall, these findings indicate an ontogenetic shift in the functional importance of individual -crystallins during zebrafish lens development. Our finding that the lens-specific zebrafish Ba-crystallin plays the leading role in preventing age-related cataract adds a new twist to our understanding of vertebrate lens evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years, our understanding of the gut microbiomes impact on host physiology and metabolism has grown exponentially. Yet, the specific role of certain microorganisms in regulating gestational health and fetal development remains largely unexplored. During pregnancy, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus that provides multiple benefits, including changes in placental development and fetal glycaemia. In this study, using germ-free mice colonized with or without Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 during pregnancy, we demonstrated that this bacterium is important for controlling fetal brain metabolism. In particular, presence of maternal Bifidobacterium led to reduced levels of ten metabolites (including citrate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and carnitine) in the fetal brain, with concurrent elevated abundance of transporters involved in glucose and branched-chain amino acid uptake. B. breve supplementation was also associated with increased expression of critical metabolic and cellular pathways, including the PI3K-AKT, AMPK, STAT5 and Wnt-{beta}-catenin (including its receptor Frizzled-7) in the fetal brain. Furthermore, maternal-associated Bifidobacterium resulted in HIF-2 protein stabilization and altered a number of genes and proteins involved in cellular growth, axogenesis, and mitochondrial function. These findings highlight that Bifidobacterium breve colonisation of the maternal gut is important for the metabolism and growth of the fetal brain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During differentiation, cells become structurally and functionally specialized, but comprehensive views of the underlying remodeling processes are elusive. Here, we leverage scRNA-seq developmental trajectories to reconstruct differentiation using two secretory tissues as a model system - the zebrafish notochord and hatching gland. First, we present an approach to integrate expression and functional similarities for gene module identification, revealing dozens of gene modules representing known and newly associated differentiation processes and their temporal ordering. Second, we focused on the unfolded protein response (UPR) transducer module to study how general versus cell-type specific secretory functions are regulated. By profiling loss- and gain-of-function embryos, we found that the UPR transcription factors creb3l1, creb3l2, and xbp1 are master regulators of a general secretion program. creb3l1/creb3l2 additionally activate an extracellular matrix secretion program, while xbp1 partners with bhlha15 to activate a gland-specific secretion program. Our study offers a multi-source integrated approach for functional gene module identification and illustrates how transcription factors confer general and specialized cellular functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Morphogenesis is the process whereby the body of an organism develops its target shape. The morphogen BMP is known to play a conserved role across bilaterian organisms in determining the dorsoventral (DV) axis. Yet, how BMP governs the spatio-temporal dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins driving morphogenetic flow remains an open question. Here, we use machine learning to mine a morphodynamic atlas of Drosophila development, and construct a mathematical model capable of predicting the coupled dynamics of myosin, E-cadherin, and morphogenetic flow. Mutant analysis shows that BMP sets the initial condition of this dynamical system according to the following signaling cascade: BMP establishes DV pair-rule-gene patterns that set-up an E-cadherin gradient which in turn creates a myosin gradient in the opposite direction through mechanochemical feedbacks. Using neural tube organoids, we argue that BMP, and the signaling cascade it triggers, prime the conserved dynamics of neuroectoderm morphogenesis from fly to humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dihydroceramide desaturases convert dihydroceramides to ceramides in the last step of the de novo ceramide pathway. Reduction of DEGS1 dihydroceramide desaturase function in humans leads to the rare neurodegenerative disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18, but the exact mechanism that underlies the disease remains unclear. Through a forward genetic screen, we discovered that infertile crescent (ifc), the sole Drosophila dihydroceramide desaturase, governs central nervous system development and morphology. Expressed and genetically active most prominently in glia rather than neurons, ifc primarily controls nervous system development through a cell autonomous function in glia. Within the nervous system, loss of ifc results in ceramide depletion, dihydroceramide accumulation, and increased saturation of major membrane phospholipids. At the cellular level, loss of ifc leads to severe glial defects, particularly in cortex glia, including expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, cell swelling, failure to enwrap neurons, and lipid droplet depletion. Our research supports a model in which inappropriate retention of dihydroceramide in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of glial cells drives ER expansion and cell swelling, disrupting glial function and leading to subsequent nervous system dysfunction. Given the conserved nature of the de novo ceramide biosynthesis pathway, our findings in the fly system suggest that dihydroceramide-triggered expansion of the ER in the membrane-rich glial cells may be the proximal cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-18 in humans.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The vertebrate body forms by progressive addition and segmentation of tissues in an anterior to posterior direction. The posterior presomitic mesoderm (pPSM), which receives new cells from the tailbud, produces an expansive force that drives axis elongation1-3. Elongation moves an FGF gradient that controls the boundary placement of new segments in conjunction with the oscillatory genes of the segmentation clock4. As the period of the segmentation clock is insensitive to body size5,6 or elongation progress7,8, the number and size consistency of segments depend on stable, robust elongation. How elongation speed is constrained remains unknown. Here we utilised modeling and tissue force microscopy9 on chicken embryos to show that cell density of the pPSM dynamically modulates elongation speed in a negative feedback loop. Elongation alters the cell density in the pPSM, which in turn controls progenitor cell influx through the mechanical coupling of body axis tissues. This enables responsive cell dynamics in over- and under-elongated axes that consequently self-adjust speed to achieve long-term robustness in axial length. Our simulations and experiments further suggest that cell density and activity under FGF signalling act synergistically to drive elongation. Our work supports a simple mechanism of morphogenetic speed control where the cell density relates negatively to progress, and positively to force generation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability to quantify transcriptional dynamics in individual cells via live imaging has revolutionized our understanding of gene regulation. However, such measurements are lacking in the context of vertebrate embryos. We addressed this deficit by applying MS2-MCP mRNA labeling to the quantification of transcription in zebrafish, a model vertebrate. We developed a platform of transgenic organisms, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, and optimized image analysis that enables visualization and quantification of MS2 reporters. We used these tools to obtain the first single-cell, real-time measurements of transcriptional dynamics of the segmentation clock. Our measurements challenge the traditional view of smooth clock oscillations and instead suggest a model of discrete transcriptional bursts that are organized in space and time. Together, these results highlight how measuring single-cell transcriptional activity can reveal unexpected features of gene regulation and how this data can fuel the dialogue between theory and experiment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vertebrate sexual development, two important steroid hormones - testosterone and estrogen - regulate the sex-specific development of many tissues. In contrast, invertebrates utilize a single steroid hormone, ecdysone, to regulate developmental timing in both sexes. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, sex-specific ecdysone activity controls important aspects of gonad sexual dimorphism. Rather than being regulated at the level of hormone production, hormone activity is regulated cell-autonomously through sex-specific hormone reception. We found that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) is regulated down-stream of the sex determination factor Doublesex (Dsx), the founding member of the Dsx/Mab3 Related Transcription Factor (DMRT) family that regulates gonad development in all animals. EcR is restricted to the developing ovary and repressed in the testis at a time when ecdysone initiates ovary morphogenesis. EcR activity drives ovary development and antagonizes development of the testis stem cell niche. Interestingly, de-repression of the ecdysone response in the testis led to rapid feminization, which is known to cause infertility. This work demonstrates that invertebrates can also use steroid hormone signaling to control sex-specific development. Further, it may help explain recent work showing that vertebrate sexual development is surprisingly cell-autonomous. For example, in birds that have a mixture of cells with male and female genotypes, the male cells develop as male and the female cells develop as female despite exposure to the same circulating hormones. Sex-specific regulation of steroid hormone response in vertebrates may well underly such cellular sexual fate choices.</p>
