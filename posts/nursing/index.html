This study aimed to create a psychological scale and investigate how nursing explanation skills affect healthcare incidents. DESIGNThe study involved psychological scale development and questionnaire surveys based on psychological paradigms. SETTINGData were collected through two web-based surveys and a field survey at a comprehensive hospital in Japan. PARTICIPANTSThe preliminary investigation involved 109 experienced nurses. Study 1 involved 1,000 nursing professionals, and Study 2 involved 159 nursing staff working in a comprehensive hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe study assessed scale scores for nursing explanation skills, communication skills, miscommunication, and patient outcomes. RESULTSNine sub-skills were identified, categorized under \"compassion\" and \"mental model sharing.\" Seven sub-skills were shared, while two were specific to interactions with patients/families or healthcare professionals. Clinical ladder progression is related to compassion and mental model sharing, whereas practical experience years only relate to mental model sharing. Compassion increased the probability of various incidents due to interactional failures, while mental model sharing enhanced the probability of severe incidents from judgmental failures and minor incidents from conceptual failures. CONCLUSIONThis study developed a psychological scale to measure nursing professionals explanation skills in communication with patients, their families, and other medical staff. It elucidated their impact on incident occurrence through miscommunication. The findings need to be practically verified through fieldwork in nursing education. What is already known on this topicA routine nursing task is explaining to patients, their families, and other healthcare professionals. Inaccurate explanations can adversely affect the quality of healthcare and patient safety. Despite the significance of good explanation skills in nursing, supporting empirical data are limited. What this study addsNine sub-skills for nursing explanation to patients/families or healthcare professionals were identified and categorized under \"compassion\" and \"mental model sharing.\" Clinical ladder progression is related to compassion and mental model sharing, whereas practical experience years only relate to mental model sharing. Compassion increased the probability of various incidents due to interactional failures, while mental model sharing enhanced the probability of severe incidents from judgmental failures and minor incidents from conceptual failures. How this study might affect research, practice, or policyFor nursing practice, compassion is vital, but it is often lacking. Nurses must use compassion and mental model sharing for precise and consistent information transmission to healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, nurses should prioritize compassion when explaining medical matters to patients and their families. We must emphasize not only mental model sharing but also compassion for nursing communication training to enhance patient safety and healthcare quality. Nursing explanation skills identified in this study depend on the purpose, not just behaviors. Teaching students the purpose behind their actions enhances more effectively nursing communication skills.\n",
