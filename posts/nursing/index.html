Introduction: Stroke is a highly consequential medical condition, characterized by a substantial risk of death and disability. Based on the data of the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke was contibuted for 6.2 million of mortalities, the second cause of death globally. In particular, half of stroke survivors encounter challenges in performing daily activities, and the psychosocial aspects of their experience often lead to a diminished quality of life, contributing to conditions like depression.">

In particular, half of stroke survivors encounter challenges in performing daily activities, and the psychosocial aspects of their experience often lead to a diminished quality of life, contributing to conditions like depression. In addition for the impact of physical, stroke also can induce the cognitive barriers, impacted to an attention, orientation, retention, and cognitives functions. In addressing these cognitive challenges, particularly through cognitive therapy, was shown promising in reducing levels of anxiety and depression among post-stroke individuals. This literature research deals to examine research outcomes related to various post-stroke cognitive therapies. The objective is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of this therapeutic approaches, clarify the effectiveness in rehabilitate of cognitive and psychological consequences of stroke. Method: Literature obtained through electronic media on Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar by used the keyword Cognitive Therapy Approach in Post Stroke Patients and it was found 5 articles that met with the criteria which had been published less than the last 10 years. Results: this study shows that cognitive interventions that duplicate memory, processing speed and attention can produce significant improvements in several cognitive domains. This therapy teaches compensatory strategies such as using a notebook or daily planner and analyzing tasks logically until activities are carried out well in daily life which involves exercises to increase attention and requires internal neurological attention. The function of this training includes visual and auditory skills, both of which are important for everyday training and information processing designed to improve retention and recall of information and improve memory. Attention and executive skill function are interdependent and have a significant impact on daily functioning. Therefore, exercises that improve attention, working and short-term memory can improve general mental abilities and improve a persons ability to process information. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that cognitive therapy can help the patients to achieve the recovery optimally both in cognitive or emotional aspects.\n",
