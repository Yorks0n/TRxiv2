G. R.; Nursalam, N.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300572\nMost diabetes mellitus patients experience psychological problems resulting from the disease, disease management, and complications. Inadequate management of psychological problems may place patients at greater risk for depression. This systematic review aims to identify the effects of mindful interventions in controlling glycemic levels and psychological well-being in diabetes mellitus patients. The systematic review conducted on the study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. This systematic review uses the Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used are diabetes mellitus type 2, mindfulness-based stress reduction, AND/OR, glycemic control, blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and psychological well-being. The words used are adjusted to the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH). The articles used are published in English in 2014 - 2023, full-text, and are research articles. The search results showed that most mindfulness interventions used were MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) for 8 weeks taught by professionals. Mindfulness is provided by trained professionals and taught again using communication media, namely CDs or mobile applications. Mindfulness has a significant effect on reducing fasting blood sugar levels and HbA1c in type 2 DM patients. Mindfulness improves psychological well-being and reduces depression, anxiety, resilience, and emotional health in diabetes patients. Mindfulness is a therapy that can be used to manage the psychological problems of DM patients where with good emotional control the patient can control glycemic levels to normal limits\nBIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TRENDS FOR MENSTRUATION PAIN\nAuthors: Pawestri, ; Pandin, M. G. R.; yunitasari, e.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300591\nBackgroundResearch interest in the topic of complementary interventions to treat menstrual pain is increasing. In future research, researchers need information about trends and new things on complementary interventions to treat menstrual pain. PurposeThe research aims to determine trends in the number of publications, journals with the highest number of publications, which fields receive the most publication permits, network visualization, overlay visualization, and density visualization on complementary topics related to intervention dealing with menstrual pain. MethodsA search for publications on trends in complementary interventions to treat primary menstrual pain in adolescents resulted in 23,935 articles, four grants, 2,427 patents, and 42 clinical trials. After filtering through specified criteria, the number of articles obtained was 3,214, 249 patents, and 19 clinical trials. ResultsA search for publications on trends in complementary interventions to treat primary menstrual pain in adolescents resulted in 23,935 articles, four grants, 2,427 patents, and 42 clinical trials. After filtering through criteria such as publication year, research categories, publication type, published between 2018-2023, focus in the field of Health sciences, nursing, public health, clinical sciences, and article publication type were included as inclusion criteria of this study. The study obtained 3,214 articles, 249 patents, and 19 clinical trials. The peak of publications regarding trends in complementary interventions to treat primary menstrual pain in adolescents occurred in 2018. Meanwhile, the lowest number was in 2023. Research on complementary intervention trends to overcome primary menstrual pain in adolescents is in medicine, public health, nursing, and other fields such as trade management, tourism and services, human society, law, and legal studies. In addition, there is currently a trend for complementary therapy interventions to treat menstrual pain. Complementary therapies that are still rarely researched are progressive muscle relaxation therapy or herbal ginger to ease menstrual pain. Apart from that, progressive muscle relaxation therapy can also be used to treat anxiety in teenagers who experience menstrual pain, or the ginger herb has rarely been researched to treat menstrual pain. ConclusionTrends regarding complementary therapy interventions to treat menstrual pain need a review to find relevant alternative interventions for adolescent development and current digital developments. It is suggested that the next researcher choose a low visualization category theme to look for novelties in further research, one of which is ginger herbal therapy to overcome menstrual pain or interventions to overcome adolescent anxiety when experiencing menstrual pain.\nCollective Impacts of Demographic and Clinical Factors on Psycho-emotional States of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cross-Sectional Study\nAuthors: Liang, C. C. C.; PAN, I.-J.\nScore: 0.2, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300609\nBackgroundTo appraise comprehensively the demographic and clinical factors that may collectively contribute to demoralization, depression and negative meaning of life in patients with cancer, employing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the representative investigative subject. PurposeTo appraise comprehensively the demographic and clinical factors that collectively contribute to demoralization, depression and negative meaning of life in patients with cancer, employing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the representative malignancy for investigation in a Taiwanese population. DesignA retrospective cross-sectional study from 2019-2020 on 250 HCC patients in hospitalized and following the STROBE guidelines. MethodsPrevalence was estimated by G-power; and associations between demographic or clinical factors and scores of Mandarin versions of Demoralization Scale (DS-MV), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) or Meaning in Life Scale (MiLs) were evaluated by Chi-square test or Pearsons product-moment correlation. ResultsFactors with DS-MV scores higher than 30 included marital status, children as primary caregiver, gender and metastasis. Factors with CES-D scores higher than 16 included marital status, children as primary caregiver, age, monthly financial support and cancer comorbidity. Factors with MiLs scores less than 7 included marital status, and recurrence or duration of cancer. ConclusionsMarital status is a major contributing factor to all three psychological states. Children as primary caregiver impacts more critically than spouse on both demoralization and depression; gender and metastasis are akin to demoralization; age, monthly financial support and cancer comorbidity contribute to depression; and recurrence and duration of cancer impact on negative meaning of life. ImpactThis is first time that collective demographic and clinical factors on the mental health of patients with liver cancer are identified. Our findings would encourage clinical nurses to be more conscious of the contribution of these factors on the emotional states of patients with cancer when performing their daily duties.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTo appraise comprehensively the demographic and clinical factors that may collectively contribute to demoralization, depression and negative meaning of life in patients with cancer, employing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the representative investigative subject.

PurposeTo appraise comprehensively the demographic and clinical factors that collectively contribute to demoralization, depression and negative meaning of life in patients with cancer, employing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the representative malignancy for investigation in a Taiwanese population.

DesignA retrospective cross-sectional study from 2019-2020 on 250 HCC patients in hospitalized and following the STROBE guidelines.

MethodsPrevalence was estimated by G-power; and associations between demographic or clinical factors and scores of Mandarin versions of Demoralization Scale (DS-MV), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) or Meaning in Life Scale (MiLs) were evaluated by Chi-square test or Pearsons product-moment correlation.

ResultsFactors with DS-MV scores higher than 30 included marital status, children as primary caregiver, gender and metastasis. Factors with CES-D scores higher than 16 included marital status, children as primary caregiver, age, monthly financial support and cancer comorbidity. Factors with MiLs scores less than 7 included marital status, and recurrence or duration of cancer.

ConclusionsMarital status is a major contributing factor to all three psychological states. Children as primary caregiver impacts more critically than spouse on both demoralization and depression; gender and metastasis are akin to demoralization; age, monthly financial support and cancer comorbidity contribute to depression; and recurrence and duration of cancer impact on negative meaning of life.

ImpactThis is first time that collective demographic and clinical factors on the mental health of patients with liver cancer are identified. Our findings would encourage clinical nurses to be more conscious of the contribution of these factors on the emotional states of patients with cancer when performing their daily duties.</p>
