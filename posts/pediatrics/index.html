A.\nScore: 2886.2, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296903\nImportanceActive monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes that may not be identified in prelicensure trials. ObjectiveTo conduct near real-time monitoring of health outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) pediatric population aged 6 months to 17 years. DesignWe evaluated 21 pre-specified health outcomes; 15 were sequentially tested through near real-time surveillance, and 6 were monitored descriptively within a cohort of vaccinated children. We tested for increased rate of each outcome following vaccination compared to a historical comparator cohort. SettingThis population-based study was conducted under the US Food and Drug Administration public health surveillance mandate using three commercial claims databases. ParticipantsChildren aged 6 months to 17 years were included if they received a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine dose before early 2023 and had continuous enrollment in a medical health insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean window to the COVID-19 vaccination dose. ExposureExposure was defined as receipt of a monovalent BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine dose. The primary analysis evaluated dose 1 and dose 2 combined, and secondary analyses evaluated each dose separately. Follow-up time was censored at death, disenrollment, end of risk window, end of study period, or a subsequent dose administration. Main OutcomesTwenty-one prespecified health outcomes. ResultsThe study included 4,102,016 enrollees aged 6 months to17 years. Thirteen of 15 outcomes sequentially tested did not meet the threshold for a statistical signal. In the primary analysis, myocarditis or pericarditis signals were detected following BNT162b2 vaccine in children aged 12-17 years old and seizures/convulsions signals were detected following vaccination with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in children aged 2-4/5 years. However, in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the seizures/convulsions signal was sensitive to background rates selection and was not observed when 2022 background rates were selected instead of 2020 rates. Conclusions and RelevanceOf the two signaled outcomes, the myocarditis or pericarditis signals are consistent with previously published reports. The new signal detected for seizures/convulsions among younger children should be further investigated in a robust epidemiological study with better confounding adjustment.\nQuantifying longitudinal changes in core autism symptoms using automated speech analysis\nAuthors: Eni, M.; Ilan, M.; Michaelovski,, A.; Golan, H.; Meiri, G.; Menashe, I.; Dinstein, I.; Zigel, Y.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-10-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.23297600\nSocial communication problems, which are a core symptom of autism, may be evident in the speech characteristics of autistic individuals. Here, we examined acoustic and conversational features extracted from audio recordings of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition (ADOS-2) assessments of 1.5-7-year-old children. We trained a deep neural network algorithm to estimate autism severity (i.e., ADOS-2 scores) from recordings of 146 children and tested its accuracy with independent recordings from 62 additional children who completed two ADOS-2 assessments, separated by 1-2 years. Estimated ADOS-2 social affect scores in the test set were significantly correlated with true scores at each time-point (r(62)=0.442-0.575, P\u003c0.001), and estimated changes across time-points were significantly correlated with true changes (r(62)=0.343, P=0.011). The presented algorithm learned to estimate social symptom severity from speech recordings of one autism group and was able to accurately estimate severity changes in an entirely independent group. While accuracy needs to be further improved by training with larger datasets, these results demonstrate the remarkable utility of speech analysis algorithms in estimating autism risk and severity changes over time.\n",
