S.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300509\nIntroductionChildhood anemia remains a persistent global challenge, emerging as the most prevalent blood disorder among children worldwide. Its enduring prevalence underscores its significance as a hematological concern of substantial public health importance, owing to its wide prevalence and potential severity. Anemias impact is particularly pronounced among children and expectant mothers. On a global scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken significant measures to address this issue. These include implementing strategies such as iron supplementation, fortifying food sources with essential nutrients, promoting dietary diversity, and preventing conditions that contribute to anemias occurrence. These collective efforts aim to alleviate the burden of anemia and enhance the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence, etiologie, and clinical outcomes of anemia among children under five years of age upon admission in three district hospitals within the Dar-es-Salaam region. MethodologyThe study employed an observational cross-sectional design to examine the prevalence, etiologies, and outcomes of anemia in children under five who were admitted to three district hospitals in Dar-es-Salaam. Data collection took place between November 2022 and July 2023, involving children manifesting clinical signs of anemia and their caregivers. A sample size of 327 was used. Structured questionnaires were administered, and data were analyzed using SPSS software, with descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression employed to find associations. Ethical considerations were adhered to throughout the study. ResultsThe study analyzed data from 327 children under five years old admitted to three district hospitals in Dar-es-Salaam to determine the prevalence, etiologies, and outcomes of anemia. The overall prevalence of anemia was found to be 45.9%, with 21.38% having mild anemia, 60% moderate anemia, and 18.62% severe anemia. Factors associated with anemia included age, referral status, family size, age of caregivers, chronic illness, deworming status, iron supplementation, active bleeding, breastfeeding, feeding adequacy, and associated comorbidities. Anemic children showed longer stays in both the ICU and wards, with an increased need for mechanical ventilators and blood transfusions. Conclusion and recommendationIn conclusion, this study pinpoint the persistent burden of childhood anemia in the Dar-es-Salaam region, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies to address its prevalence and impact. The high prevalence of anemia, particularly moderate and severe cases, suggests an important need for targeted interventions. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended that health authorities and stakeholders implement and reinforce iron supplementation programs, promote dietary diversity, enhance deworming efforts, and raise awareness about anemias implications. Furthermore, healthcare facilities should prioritize early detection and management of anemia in pediatric patients to reduce the associated morbidity and resource utilization.\nAsymptomatic hypoglycemia among preterm newborns: a cross-sectional analysis.\nAuthors: Salum, S. S.; Kalabamu, F. S.; Fataki, M. R.; Omary, S. A.; Mohamed, U. H.; Kizwi, H. A.; Leshabari, K. M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300665\nBackgroundHypoglycemia is the commonest metabolic abnormality encountered in newborns. Preterm newborns are the group with the highest risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia. However exact factors associated with asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia is not known. ObjectiveTo assess factors associated with asymptomatic hypoglycemia among preterm newborns. Materials and MethodsA cross sectional hospital analytical-based study was carried out at Dar es salaam public regional referral hospitals. Specifically, the study was done at Amana, Mwananyamala and Temeke. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics of preterm newborns and their mothers were collected and analyzed using Epi-Info software version 7.4. Main data analysis was done by applying a multivariable logistic regression model with neonatal random glycaemia coded in a binary fashion at a cut-off point of 2.6 mmol/L. An -level of 5% was used as a limit of type I error. ResultsWe recruited and analysed 217 asymptomatic preterm newborns within 6-24 hours post-delivery. Male: Female = 1.1:1 (females n=105, 48.4%). Median glycemic level was 2.6 (IQR; 2.1-3.9) mmol/L. Breastfeeding within 1st hour post-delivery was the only statistically significant protective factor against development of neonatal hypoglycemia (OR; 0.123, 95%-CI; 0.052-0.287) in a fitted multivariable logistic regression model. ConclusionNearly half of all asymptomatic newborns were in hypoglycemic range. Delayed breast feeding within 1st hour post-delivery was associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. RecommendationsBreastfeeding practices within 1st hour post-delivery need to be emphasized to all expectant mothers in order to avoid risk of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia. Preterm neonates maybe the risky group worth considering for continuous glycemic screening at hospital protocols.\n",
