A.\nScore: 144.6, Published: 2023-10-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296903\nImportance Active monitoring of health outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination provides early detection of rare outcomes that may not be identified in prelicensure trials. Objective To conduct near-real-time monitoring of health outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination in the United States (US) pediatric population aged 6 months to 17 years. Design We evaluated 21 pre-specified health outcomes; 15 were sequentially tested through near-real-time surveillance, and 6 were monitored descriptively within a cohort of vaccinated children. We tested for increased rate of each outcome following vaccination compared to a historical comparator cohort. Setting This population-based study was conducted under the US Food and Drug Administration public health surveillance mandate using three commercial claims databases. Participants Children aged 6 months to 17 years were included if they received a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine dose before early 2023 and had continuous enrollment in a medical health insurance plan from the start of an outcome-specific clean window to the COVID-19 vaccination dose. Exposure Exposure was defined as receipt of a monovalent BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine dose. The primary analysis evaluated dose 1 and dose 2 combined, and secondary analyses evaluated each dose separately. Follow-up time was censored at death, disenrollment, end of risk window, end of study period, or a subsequent dose administration. Main Outcomes Twenty-one prespecified health outcomes. Results The study included 4,102,016 enrollees aged 6 months to17 years. Thirteen of 15 outcomes sequentially tested did not meet the threshold for a statistical signal. In the primary analysis, myocarditis or pericarditis signals were detected following BNT162b2 vaccine in children aged 12-17 years old and seizures/convulsions signals were detected following vaccination with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in children aged 2-4/5 years. However, in a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, the seizures/convulsions signal was sensitive to background rates selection and was not observed when 2022 background rates were selected instead of 2020 rates. Conclusions and Relevance Of the two signaled outcomes, the myocarditis or pericarditis signals are consistent with previously published reports. The new signal detected for seizures/convulsions among younger children should be further investigated in a robust epidemiological study with better confounding adjustment.\nDisease and Economic Burden of Stillbirths in India in 2019\nAuthors: Dubey, S.; Wadhwani, V.; Zadey, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.16.23297071\nAbstract Background: India has the highest absolute number of stillbirths worldwide. Despite the high burden and preventable nature, stillbirth is not high on the health agenda including the absence of stillbirths in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates. We assessed the disease and economic burden of stillbirth in India. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, the number of stillbirths, live births, and life expectancy was derived from the Health Management Information System (HMIS) 2019 for India and its 21 states. Additionally, values from the civil and sample registration systems were used for secondary analysis. Two stillbirth rates were calculated- still live birth rate (SLBR) using live births and still total birth rate (STBR) using total births i.e., live and stillbirths. We calculated stillbirth-adjusted life expectancy (SALE). For disease burden, measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we multiplied live births with the absolute difference of SALE and live-birth life expectancy. We calculated the stillbirth contribution of under-5 DALYs derived from GBD 2019. Economic burden was calculated under the value of life-year (VLY) approach by multiplying stillbirth DALYs with per capita domestic product. Three values were calculated based on different domestic product values from the Reserve Bank of India and National Health Accounts data for 2019. Results: As per HMIS, India had 263342 stillbirths. Nationally, the SLBR and STBR were 12.4 and 12.25, respectively. Stillbirths decreased the overall life expectancy at birth by 0.85 years. Stillbirths contributed to 18.1 million DALYs and the economic burden was INR 7.7 trillion in 2019. Stillbirths contributed 22% to under-5 DALYs. Eight states (30.9%) contribute to more than 50% of disease and economic burden. Conclusion: These findings suggest a high disease and economic burden of stillbirth in India with across-state variations. Incorporating burden metrics in child health policies could improve resource allocation.\n",
