S.\nScore: 26.1, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.29.23300509\nIntroduction: Childhood anemia remains a persistent global challenge, emerging as the most prevalent blood disorder among children worldwide. Its enduring prevalence underscores its significance as a hematological concern of substantial public health importance, owing to its wide prevalence and potential severity. Anemia's impact is particularly pronounced among children and expectant mothers. On a global scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken significant measures to address this issue. These include implementing strategies such as iron supplementation, fortifying food sources with essential nutrients, promoting dietary diversity, and preventing conditions that contribute to anemia's occurrence. These collective efforts aim to alleviate the burden of anemia and enhance the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence, etiologie, and clinical outcomes of anemia among children under five years of age upon admission in three district hospitals within the Dar-es-Salaam region. Methodology: The study employed an observational cross-sectional design to examine the prevalence, etiologies, and outcomes of anemia in children under five who were admitted to three district hospitals in Dar-es-Salaam. Data collection took place between November 2022 and July 2023, involving children manifesting clinical signs of anemia and their caregivers. A sample size of 327 was used. Structured questionnaires were administered, and data were analyzed using SPSS software, with descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression employed to find associations. Ethical considerations were adhered to throughout the study. Results: The study analyzed data from 327 children under five years old admitted to three district hospitals in Dar-es-Salaam to determine the prevalence, etiologies, and outcomes of anemia. The overall prevalence of anemia was found to be 45.9%, with 21.38% having mild anemia, 60% moderate anemia, and 18.62% severe anemia. Factors associated with anemia included age, referral status, family size, age of caregivers, chronic illness, deworming status, iron supplementation, active bleeding, breastfeeding, feeding adequacy, and associated comorbidities. Anemic children showed longer stays in both the ICU and wards, with an increased need for mechanical ventilators and blood transfusions. Conclusion and recommendation: In conclusion, this study pinpoint the persistent burden of childhood anemia in the Dar-es-Salaam region, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies to address its prevalence and impact. The high prevalence of anemia, particularly moderate and severe cases, suggests an important need for targeted interventions. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended that health authorities and stakeholders implement and reinforce iron supplementation programs, promote dietary diversity, enhance deworming efforts, and raise awareness about anemia's implications. Furthermore, healthcare facilities should prioritize early detection and management of anemia in pediatric patients to reduce the associated morbidity and resource utilization.\nA Bibliometric Approach to Scientific Production on Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets in Scopus (2000-2022)\nAuthors: Hernandez-Garcia, F.; Gil-Pena, H.; Rodriguez-Suarez, J.; Lopez Garcia, J. M.; Fuente Perez, R.; Oro Carbajosa, P.; Corrales-Reyes, I. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.26.23300534\nBackgroundHypophosphatemic rickets are disabling conditions that negatively impact physical functioning, activities of daily living, mental health, social life, and leisure activities. The most common cause of Hypophosphatemic rickets is genetic factors, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia. The evaluation of the scientific application of familial hypophosphatemic rickets aids in understanding the research landscape, identifying opportunities for improvement, and promoting significant advancements in the understanding and treatment of this medical condition. MethodsAn observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was conducted through a bibliometric analysis of the scientific output of the Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets published in journals indexed in Scopus during 2020-2022. To retrieve the publications, Scopus was accessed on April 4, 2023, and an advanced search was performed using a filter by title, abstract and key words, source (journals), publication year, and type of article (article and review). The search terms used were extracted from the PubMed Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) related to the disease included in the MeSH catalog. Additionally, an analysis of co-occurrence between countries and keywords was carried out with VOSviewer software. ResultsThis study identified 1,269 articles on hypophosphatemic rickets (938 articles and 331 reviews). In total, 39,548 citations were received, with an H index of 95. The majority of the articles (76.9%) were published in high-impact journals (Q1 and Q2 journals). Scientific production has shown a growing trend in recent years. The countries with the highest scientific production are the U.Ss, Japan, and the United Kingdom, considering that middle- and low-income countries contribute less to international scientific production. ConclusionsScientific production has shown sustained growth in recent years. The U.Ss solidifies itself as the country leading scientific production on hypophosphatemic rickets.\nChanges in the medical admissions and mortality amongst children in four South African hospitals following the COVID -19 pandemic: A five-year review.\nAuthors: Naidoo, K. L.; Dorwood, J.; Chinniah, K.; Lawler, M.; Nattar, Y.; Bottomley, C.; Archary, M.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.28.23300622\nBackground Vulnerable children from poor communities with high HIV and Tuberculosis(TB) burdens were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns. Concern was raised about the extent of this impact and anticipated post-pandemic surges in mortality. Methods Interrupted time series segmented regression analyses were done using routinely collected facility-level data of children admitted for medical conditions at four South African referral hospitals. Monthly admission and mortality data over a 60-month period from 01 April 2018 to 31 January 2023 was analysed using models which included dummy lockdown level variables, a dummy post-COVID period variable, Fourier terms to account for seasonality, and excess mortality as a proxy for healthcare burden. Results Of the 45 015 admissions analysed, 1237(2{middle dot}75%) demised with significant decreases in admissions during all the lockdown levels, with the most significant mean monthly decrease of 450(95%, CI=657{middle dot}3, -244{middle dot}3) p\u003c0{middle dot}001 in level 5 (the most severe) lockdown. There was evidence of loss of seasonality on a six-month scale during the COVID periods for all admissions (p=0{middle dot}002), including under-one-year-olds (p=0{middle dot}034) and under-five-year-olds (p=0{middle dot}004). No decreases in mortality accompanied decreased admissions . Post-pandemic surges in admissions or mortality were not identified in children with acute gastroenteritis, acute pneumonia and severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, paediatric admissions in 4 hospitals serving communities with high levels of HIV ,TB and poverty decreased similar to global experiences however there was no change in in-hospital mortality. No post-pandemic surge in admissions or mortality were documented. Differences in the impact of pandemic control measures on transmission of childhood infections and access to health care may account for differing outcomes seen in our setting compared to the global experiences. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of pandemic control measures on healthcare provision and transmission dynamics and to better inform future responses amongst vulnerable child populations .\nInvestigating the spatial accessibility and coverage of the pediatric COVID-19 vaccine: an ecologic study of regional health data\nAuthors: Bemanian, A.; Mosser, J. F.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300589\nBackground The COVID-19 pandemic presented healthcare workers and public health agency a unique challenge of having to rapidly deliver a novel set of vaccines during a public health crisis. For pediatric patients, there was an additional layer of complexity given the delayed timeline to deliver these vaccines and the differences in dosing and available products depending on the age of those receiving the vaccine. This paper investigates the spatial accessibility and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in King County, WA, USA. Methods Public data for COVID-19 vaccine sites to calculate spatial accessibility using an enhanced two step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) technique. Spatial regression analyses were done looking at the relationship between spatial accessibility and ZIP code level vaccination rates. Relationships with other socioeconomic and demographic variables were calculated as well. Findings Higher rates of vaccine accessibility and vaccine coverage were found in adolescent (12 to 17-year-old) individuals relative to school age (5 to 11-year-old) individuals. Vaccine accessibility was positively associated with coverage in both age groups in the univariable analysis. This relationship was affected by neighborhood educational attainment. Interpretation This paper successfully demonstrates how spatial accessibility measures such as E2SFCA can be used to assess the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine in a region such as a metropolitan area or county. It also provides insight into some of the ecological factors that affect COVID-19 vaccination rates. Implementation of these technique could help public health authorities and healthcare organization plan future vaccination efforts.\nExclusive Enteral Nutrition Initiates Protective Microbiome Changes to Induce Remission in Pediatric Crohn's Disease\nAuthors: Haecker, D.; Siebert, K.; Smith, B. J.; Koehler, N.; Heimes, H.; Metwaly, A.; Mahapatra, A.; Hoelz, H. L.; De Zen, F.; Heetmeyer, J.; Socas, K.; Giang, L. T.; Meng, C.; Kleigrewe, K.; Pauling, J. K.; Neuhaus, K.; List, M.; Pollard, K. S.; Schwerd, T.; Haller, D.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.23300351\nExclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the first-line therapy for pediatric Crohns disease (CD), but protective mechanisms remain unknown. We established a prospective pediatric cohort (n = 1271 fecal samples) to characterize the function of fecal microbiota and metabolite changes of treatment-naive CD patients in response to EEN. Integrated multi-omics analysis identified network clusters from individually variable microbiome profiles, with Lachnospiraceae and medium chain fatty acids as protective features. Metagenomic analysis identified strain-level dynamics in response to EEN cessation, and 577 gene functions with significant changes in abundance. Functional changes of diet-exposed fecal microbiota were further validated in a combined approach using gut chemostat cultures and microbiota transfer into germ-free IL-10- deficient mice. EEN-like and fiber-rich dietary model conditions respectively prevented or induced IBD-like inflammation in gnotobiotic mice. Hence, we provide evidence that EEN therapy operates through explicit functional changes of temporally and individually variable microbiome profiles.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundHypophosphatemic rickets are disabling conditions that negatively impact physical functioning, activities of daily living, mental health, social life, and leisure activities. The most common cause of Hypophosphatemic rickets is genetic factors, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia. The evaluation of the scientific application of familial hypophosphatemic rickets aids in understanding the research landscape, identifying opportunities for improvement, and promoting significant advancements in the understanding and treatment of this medical condition.

MethodsAn observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was conducted through a bibliometric analysis of the scientific output of the Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets published in journals indexed in Scopus during 2020-2022. To retrieve the publications, Scopus was accessed on April 4, 2023, and an advanced search was performed using a filter by title, abstract and key words, source (journals), publication year, and type of article (article and review). The search terms used were extracted from the PubMed Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) related to the disease included in the MeSH catalog. Additionally, an analysis of co-occurrence between countries and keywords was carried out with VOSviewer software.

ResultsThis study identified 1,269 articles on hypophosphatemic rickets (938 articles and 331 reviews). In total, 39,548 citations were received, with an H index of 95. The majority of the articles (76.9%) were published in high-impact journals (Q1 and Q2 journals). Scientific production has shown a growing trend in recent years. The countries with the highest scientific production are the U.Ss, Japan, and the United Kingdom, considering that middle- and low-income countries contribute less to international scientific production.

ConclusionsScientific production has shown sustained growth in recent years. The U.Ss solidifies itself as the country leading scientific production on hypophosphatemic rickets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background Vulnerable children from poor communities with high HIV and Tuberculosis(TB) burdens were impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns. Concern was raised about the extent of this impact and anticipated post-pandemic surges in mortality. Methods Interrupted time series segmented regression analyses were done using routinely collected facility-level data of children admitted for medical conditions at four South African referral hospitals. Monthly admission and mortality data over a 60-month period from 01 April 2018 to 31 January 2023 was analysed using models which included dummy lockdown level variables, a dummy post-COVID period variable, Fourier terms to account for seasonality, and excess mortality as a proxy for healthcare burden. Results Of the 45 015 admissions analysed, 1237(2{middle dot}75%) demised with significant decreases in admissions during all the lockdown levels, with the most significant mean monthly decrease of 450(95%, CI=657{middle dot}3, -244{middle dot}3) p&lt;0{middle dot}001 in level 5 (the most severe) lockdown. There was evidence of loss of seasonality on a six-month scale during the COVID periods for all admissions (p=0{middle dot}002), including under-one-year-olds (p=0{middle dot}034) and under-five-year-olds (p=0{middle dot}004). No decreases in mortality accompanied decreased admissions . Post-pandemic surges in admissions or mortality were not identified in children with acute gastroenteritis, acute pneumonia and severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, paediatric admissions in 4 hospitals serving communities with high levels of HIV ,TB and poverty decreased similar to global experiences however there was no change in in-hospital mortality. No post-pandemic surge in admissions or mortality were documented. Differences in the impact of pandemic control measures on transmission of  childhood infections and access to health care may account for differing outcomes seen in our setting compared to the global experiences. Further studies are needed to understand  the impact of pandemic control measures on healthcare provision and transmission dynamics and  to better  inform future responses amongst vulnerable child populations .</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background The COVID-19 pandemic presented healthcare workers and public health agency a unique challenge of having to rapidly deliver a novel set of vaccines during a public health crisis. For pediatric patients, there was an additional layer of complexity given the delayed timeline to deliver these vaccines and the differences in dosing and available products depending on the age of those receiving the vaccine. This paper investigates the spatial accessibility and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in King County, WA, USA. Methods Public data for COVID-19 vaccine sites to calculate spatial accessibility using an enhanced two step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) technique. Spatial regression analyses were done looking at the relationship between spatial accessibility and ZIP code level vaccination rates. Relationships with other socioeconomic and demographic variables were calculated as well. Findings Higher rates of vaccine accessibility and vaccine coverage were found in adolescent (12 to 17-year-old) individuals relative to school age (5 to 11-year-old) individuals. Vaccine accessibility was positively associated with coverage in both age groups in the univariable analysis. This relationship was affected by neighborhood educational attainment. Interpretation This paper successfully demonstrates how spatial accessibility measures such as E2SFCA can be used to assess the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine in a region such as a metropolitan area or county. It also provides insight into some of the ecological factors that affect COVID-19 vaccination rates. Implementation of these technique could help public health authorities and healthcare organization plan future vaccination efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the first-line therapy for pediatric Crohns disease (CD), but protective mechanisms remain unknown. We established a prospective pediatric cohort (n = 1271 fecal samples) to characterize the function of fecal microbiota and metabolite changes of treatment-naive CD patients in response to EEN. Integrated multi-omics analysis identified network clusters from individually variable microbiome profiles, with Lachnospiraceae and medium chain fatty acids as protective features. Metagenomic analysis identified strain-level dynamics in response to EEN cessation, and 577 gene functions with significant changes in abundance. Functional changes of diet-exposed fecal microbiota were further validated in a combined approach using gut chemostat cultures and microbiota transfer into germ-free IL-10- deficient mice. EEN-like and fiber-rich dietary model conditions respectively prevented or induced IBD-like inflammation in gnotobiotic mice. Hence, we provide evidence that EEN therapy operates through explicit functional changes of temporally and individually variable microbiome profiles.</p>
