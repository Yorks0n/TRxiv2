Our study presents the first cohort of young individuals in Germany who were diagnosed with ME/CFS following EBV-IM. MethodsWe conducted a one-year follow-up of 25 young people diagnosed with ME/CFS at our specialized tertiary outpatient service by clinical criteria requiring post-exertional malaise and with documented EBV-IM as the triggering event. Demographic information, laboratory findings, frequency and severity of symptoms, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed at first visit as well as 6 and 12 months later at follow-up visits. ResultsThe physical functioning and HRQoL of the cohort were significantly impaired, with young adults displaying more severe symptoms, as well as worsening of fatigue, physical and mental functioning, and HRQoL throughout the study, compared to adolescents. After one year, we found that 6/12 (54%) adolescents no longer met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, indicating partial remission, while all young adults continued to fulfill the Canadian consensus criteria. Improvement in children was evident in physical functioning, symptom frequency and severity, and HRQoL, while young adults had little improvement. EBV serology and EBV DNA load did not correlate with distinct clinical features of ME/CFS, and clinical chemistry showed no evidence of inflammation. Remarkably, the median time from symptom onset to ME/CFS diagnosis was 13.8 (IQR: 9.1-34.9) months. ConclusionsME/CFS following EBV-IM in young people is a severely debilitating disease with diagnoses protracted longer than one year in many patients and only limited responses to conventional symptom-oriented medical care. Although younger children may have a better prognosis, their condition can fluctuate and significantly impact their HRQoL. Our data emphasize that biomarkers and effective therapeutic options are also urgently needed for this very young age group to better manage their medical condition and pave the way to recovery.\nMultivariate patterns between brain network properties, polygenic scores, phenotypes, and environment in preadolescents\nAuthors: Seo, J.; Lee, E.; Kim, B.-G.; Kim, G.; Joo, Y. Y.; Cha, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-07-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.24.23293075\nThe brain network is an infrastructure for cognitive and behavioral processes. Genetic and environmental factors influence the development of the brain network. However, little is known about how specific genetic traits and childrens brain network properties are related. Furthermore, insight into the holistic relationship of brain network properties with genes, environment, and phenotypic outcomes in children is still limited. To fill these knowledge gaps, we investigated the multivariate associations between the brain network properties and three domains using a large youth sample (the ABCD study, N=9,393, 9-10 years old): (i) genetic predisposition of various traits, (ii) phenotypic outcomes, and (iii) environmental factors. We constructed structural brain networks using probabilistic tractography and estimated nodal and global network measures such as degree and network efficiency. We then conducted sparse canonical correlation analysis with brain network measures and polygenic scores of 30 complex traits (e.g., IQ), phenotypic traits (e.g., cognitive ability), and environmental variables. We found multivariate associations of brain network properties with (i) genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, (ii) genetic influence on cognitive ability, and (iii) the phenotype of cognitive ability-psychopathology in preadolescents. Our subsequent mediation analysis using the latent variables from the canonical correlation analysis showed that the influence of genetic factors for cognitive ability on the cognitive outcomes was partially mediated by the brain network properties. Taken together, this study shows the key role of the development of the brain structural network in children in cognitive development with its tight, likely causal, relationship with genetic factors. These findings may shed light on future studies of the longitudinal deviations of those gene-environment-brain network relationships in normal and disease conditions.\n",
