BackgroundMost neonatal deaths occur among low birth weight infants. However, in resource-limited settings, these infants are commonly discharged early which further exposes them to mortality. Previous studies on morbidity and mortality among low birth weight infants after early discharge mainly focused on very low birth weight infants, and none described post-discharge neonatal mortality.">

However, in resource-limited settings, these infants are commonly discharged early which further exposes them to mortality. Previous studies on morbidity and mortality among low birth weight infants after early discharge mainly focused on very low birth weight infants, and none described post-discharge neonatal mortality. This study aimed to determine the proportion and predictors of mortality among low birth weight neonates discharged from the Special Care Baby Unit at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda. MethodsThis was a prospective cohort study of 220 low birth weight neonates discharged from the Special Care Baby Unit at Mulago National Referral Hospital. These were followed up to 28 completed days of life, or death, whichever occurred first. Proportions were used to express mortality. To determine the predictors of mortality, Cox hazards regression was performed. ResultsOf the 220 enrolled participants, 216 (98.1%) completed the follow-up. The mean gestational age of study participants was 34 {+/-}3 weeks. The median weight at discharge was 1,650g (IQR: 1,315g - 1,922g) and 46.1% were small for gestational age. During follow-up, 14/216 (6.5%) of neonates died. Mortality was highest (7/34, 20.6%) among neonates with discharge weights less than 1,200g. The causes of death included presumed neonatal sepsis (10/14, 71.4%), suspected aspiration pneumonia (2/14, 14.3%), and suspected cot death (2/14, 14.3%). The median time to death after discharge was 11 days (range 3-16 days). The predictors of mortality were a discharge weight of less than 1,200g (adj HR: 23.47, p \u003c0.001), a 5-minute Apgar score of less than 7 (adj HR: 4.25, p = 0.016), and a diagnosis of neonatal sepsis during admission (adj HR: 7.93, p = 0.009). ConclusionPost-discharge mortality among low birth weight neonates at Mulago National Referral Hospital is high. A discharge weight of less than 1,200g may be considered unsafe among neonates. Caregiver education about neonatal danger signs, and measures to prevent sepsis, aspiration, and cot death should be emphasized before discharge and during follow-up visits.\n",
