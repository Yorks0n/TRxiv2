J.; Delivett, C.; Peet, A.; Waite, J.; Novak, J.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301212\nSurvivors of pediatric brain tumour patients are at high risk of cognitive morbidity. There is clinical benefit in being able to reliably predict, at the individual patient level, whether a patient will experience these difficulties or not, the degree of impairment, and the domains affected. Whilst established risk factors exist, quantitative analysis of MRI could provide added predictive value towards this goal, above and beyond existing clinical risk models. The current systematic review aims to answer the question \"Do MRI markers predict future cognitive functioning in pediatric brain tumour survivors?\". Studies of pediatric brain tumour patients which test the value of MRI variables in predicting later neuropsychological outcomes were searched up to July 2022. Only included were studies where MRI scans were acquired at an earlier timepoint and used to predict a childs performance on cognitive tests at a later timepoint. Surprisingly few studies were identified by the search process which specifically investigated MRI measures of cerebellar and white matter damage as features in predicting cognitive outcomes. However, the important finding of this review is that the current literature is limited and those identified had small sample sizes and were rated as poor quality for the purposes of prediction. Overall, current findings are at high risk of bias and thus the quality and impact of conclusions are limited. Given the significant impact for this clinical population that predictive models would enable, the current review affirms the need for a call to action for medical imaging researchers in pediatric neuro-oncology.\nAsymptomatic hypoglycemia among preterm newborns: a cross-sectional analysis.\nAuthors: Salum, S. S.; Kalabamu, F. S.; Fataki, M. R.; Omary, S. A.; Mohamed, U. H.; Kizwi, H. A.; Leshabari, K. M.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-12-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.30.23300665\nBackgroundHypoglycemia is the commonest metabolic abnormality encountered in newborns. Preterm newborns are the group with the highest risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia. However exact factors associated with asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia is not known. ObjectiveTo assess factors associated with asymptomatic hypoglycemia among preterm newborns. Materials and MethodsA cross sectional hospital analytical-based study was carried out at Dar es salaam public regional referral hospitals. Specifically, the study was done at Amana, Mwananyamala and Temeke. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics of preterm newborns and their mothers were collected and analyzed using Epi-Info software version 7.4. Main data analysis was done by applying a multivariable logistic regression model with neonatal random glycaemia coded in a binary fashion at a cut-off point of 2.6 mmol/L. An -level of 5% was used as a limit of type I error. ResultsWe recruited and analysed 217 asymptomatic preterm newborns within 6-24 hours post-delivery. Male: Female = 1.1:1 (females n=105, 48.4%). Median glycemic level was 2.6 (IQR; 2.1-3.9) mmol/L. Breastfeeding within 1st hour post-delivery was the only statistically significant protective factor against development of neonatal hypoglycemia (OR; 0.123, 95%-CI; 0.052-0.287) in a fitted multivariable logistic regression model. ConclusionNearly half of all asymptomatic newborns were in hypoglycemic range. Delayed breast feeding within 1st hour post-delivery was associated with neonatal hypoglycemia. RecommendationsBreastfeeding practices within 1st hour post-delivery need to be emphasized to all expectant mothers in order to avoid risk of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia. Preterm neonates maybe the risky group worth considering for continuous glycemic screening at hospital protocols.\n",
