Therefore, well-supported fossil identifications are paramount for examining the impact of past environmental changes on populations and communities. Here we apply an apomorphic identification framework in a case study identifying fossil lizard remains from Halls Cave, a late Quaternary fossil site located in Central Texas, USA. We present images and descriptions of a broad comparative sample of North American lizard cranial elements and compile new and previously reported apomorphic characters for identifying fossil lizards. Our fossil identifications from Halls Cave resulted in a minimum of 11 lizard taxa, including five lizard taxa previously unknown from the site. Most of the identified fossil lizard taxa inhabit the area around Halls Cave today, but we reinforce the presence of an extirpated species complex of horned lizard. A main goal of this work is to establish a procedure for making well-supported fossil lizard identifications across North America. The data from this study will assist researchers endeavoring to identify fossil lizards, increasing the potential for novel discoveries related to North American lizards and facilitating more holistic views of ancient faunal assemblages.\nCuticleTrace: A toolkit for capturing cell outlines of leaf cuticle with implications for paleoecology and paleoclimatology\nAuthors: Lloyd, B.

Epidermal cells form the surface through which light capture and gas exchange takes place, serving as the primary interface between plants and their environment. Epidermal pavement cells exhibit highly variable morphology, influenced by both phylogeny and environment. This variation is of interest to a broad range of plant biologists, including paleobotanists, systematists, and physiologists. Existing automated methods for epidermal pavement cell segmentation are limited in their application and have not been widely adopted. The labor needed to generate hand-traced datasets have circumscribed the use of epidermal cell morphology in paleoenvironmental, phylogenetic, and phenomic research. C_LIO_LITo streamline epidermal cell analysis, we developed CuticleTrace, a suite of FIJI and R-based functions that streamlines and automates the segmentation and measurement of epidermal pavement cells across a wide range of cell morphologies and image qualities. To test CuticleTraces effectiveness, we compared CuticleTrace measurements to those from alternate automated methods and expert and undergraduate hand-tracings across a taxonomically diverse 50-image dataset of variable image qualities. C_LIO_LICuticleTrace measurements consistently aligned more closely with expert hand-traced measurements than expert measurements did with undergraduate hand-tracings and alternate automated measurements. We observed [~]93% statistical agreement between CuticleTrace and expert measurements. C_LIO_LICuticleTrace is broadly applicable, modular, and customizable, and integrates data visualization and cell shape measurement with image segmentation, lowering the barrier to high-throughput studies of epidermal morphology by vastly decreasing the labor investment required to generate high-quality cell shape datasets.
