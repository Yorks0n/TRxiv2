It is closely related with the position of the centre of masses of their multi-toned barrel-shaped bodies, and experiences one of the most noticeable posture changes along macronarian evolution. Deeply-branched macronaria achieve increasingly arched hind limbs in what it is known as wide-gauge posture. However, it is not clear if this evolutionary trend is related to the evolutionary cascade toward gigantism despite some titanosaurian were the largest terrestrial vertebrates ever-existed. We tested through means of 3D geometric morphometrics for evolutionary changes in hind limb morphology along Macronaria phylogenetic tree. The macronarian hind limb does become progressively more arched toward deeply-branched Saltasauridae. However, there is morphological convergence between different subclades. Wide-gauge posture does not correlate with changes in body size deeper in the macronarian evolutionary tree, acting as exaptation to gigantism. Despite some titanosaurian subclades becoming some of the largest vertebrates, there is a phyletic body size decrease in Macronaria.\nA continuous centennial Lateglacial-Early Holocene (15-10 cal kyr BP) palynological record from the Iberian Pyrenees and regional comparisons\nAuthors: Rull, V.; Blasco, A.; Calero, M. A.; Blaauw, M.; Vegas-Vilarrubia, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-09-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547433\nThis paper presents the first continuous (gap-free) Lateglacial-Early Holocene (LGEH) pollen record for the Iberian Pyrenees resolved at centennial resolution. The main aims are (i) to provide a standard chronostratigraphic correlation framework, (ii) to unravel the relationships between vegetation shifts, climatic changes and fire, and (iii) to obtain a regional picture of LGEH vegetation for the Pyrenees and the surrounding lowlands. Seven pollen assemblage zones were obtained and correlated with the stadial/interstadial phases of the Greenland ice cores that serve as a global reference. Several well-dated datums were also derived for keystone individual taxa that are useful for correlation purposes. Four vegetation types were identified, two of them corresponding to conifer and deciduous forests (Cf, Df) and two representing open vegetation types with no modern analogs (periglacial herbs, or PH, and Saxifraga-Cichorioideae, or SC). The first two forests dominated during interstadial phases (Bolling/Allerod and Early Holocene), and PH dominated during stadials (Oldest Dryas and Younger Dryas), with SC being important only in the first half of the Younger Dryas. The use of pollen-independent proxies for temperature (oxygen isotopes) and moisture (titanium) allowed the reconstruction of paleoclimatic trends and the responses of the four vegetation types defined. The most relevant observation in this sense was the finding of wet climates during the Younger Dryas, which challenges the traditional view of arid Pyrenean conditions for this phase on the basis of former pollen records. Fire incidence was low until the early Holocene, when regional fires were exacerbated, probably due to the combination of higher temperatures and forest biomass accumulation. These results are compared with the pollen records available for the whole Pyrenean range and the surrounding lowlands within the framework of elevational, climatic and biogeographical gradients. Some potential future developments are suggested on the basis of the obtained results, with an emphasis on the reconsideration of the LGEH spatiotemporal moisture patterns and the comparison of the Pyrenees with other European ranges from different climatic and biogeographical regions.\nGIRAFFOIDS FROM THE SIWALIKS OF PAKISTAN\nAuthors: Solounias, N.; Iba, M.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.06.561267\nAlthough today they occur in Africa, during the Miocene Giraffoids were widespread in Eurasia. We describe the giraffoid faunas found in the Siwaliks of Pakistan. These faunas are extremely rich and provide with several new giraffoid taxa that are morphologically different to what taxa known before and give new insights in the taxa. Non-Siwalik localities that contribute key information are: Fort Ternan, Kalodirr, Tung Gur, Gebel Zelten, Gebel Hamrin and Bou Hanifia. (1) The Palaoemerycidae are distinct with ossicones and an occipital horn. The list of taxa includes five new palaeomerycids: Tauromeryx canteroi nov. sp., Charis gratia nov. gen. sp. nov., Fovea fossata nov. gen. sp. nov, Goniomeryx flynni gen. nov. sp. nov., and Lateralia morgani nov. gen. nov. sp. nov.; (2) new climacoceratids: Vittoria soriae gen nov. sp nov. Orangemeryx badgleyi nov. sp. We also define two new ranks within the Climacoceridae family: the Climacocerinae and the Prolibytheriinae. (3) Preliminary systematics suggest that Giraffidae can be subdivided into two clades: the long and the short neck groups. The Siwaliks sample a total of twelve different giraffids: Progiraffa exigua, Giraffokeryx punjabiensis, Ua pilbeami, Orea leptia, Injanatherium hazimi, Giraffa punjabiensis, Giraffa sivalensis, Decennatherium asiaticum, Bramatherium megacephalum, Bramatherium perminese, Bamiscus micros, and Sivatherium giganteum. Palaeotragus germanii and Bohlinia tungurensis are new determinations. Progiraffinae and Bramatheriinae as new subfamilies. The subfamilies of Giraffidae seem to hold as isolated evolutionary silos. They are: Progiraffinae, Giraffokerycinae, Okapiinae, Bohlininae, Giraffinae, Palaeotraginae, Samotheriinae, Bramatheriinae and Sivatheriinae. It is hard to connect these subfamilies as they most appear around 15 Ma.\nAlasemenia, the earliest ovule with three wings and without cupule\nAuthors: Wang, D.; Yang, J.; Liu, L.; Zhou, Y.; Xu, P.; Qin, M.; Huang, P.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561822\nThe ovules or seeds (fertilized ovules) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in wind dispersal and probable photosynthetic nutrition. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Although today they occur in Africa, during the Miocene Giraffoids were widespread in Eurasia. We describe the giraffoid faunas found in the Siwaliks of Pakistan. These faunas are extremely rich and provide with several new giraffoid taxa that are morphologically different to what taxa known before and give new insights in the taxa. Non-Siwalik localities that contribute key information are: Fort Ternan, Kalodirr, Tung Gur, Gebel Zelten, Gebel Hamrin and Bou Hanifia. (1) The Palaoemerycidae are distinct with ossicones and an occipital horn. The list of taxa includes five new palaeomerycids: Tauromeryx canteroi nov. sp., Charis gratia nov. gen. sp. nov., Fovea fossata nov. gen. sp. nov, Goniomeryx flynni gen. nov. sp. nov., and Lateralia morgani nov. gen. nov. sp. nov.; (2) new climacoceratids: Vittoria soriae gen nov. sp nov. Orangemeryx badgleyi nov. sp. We also define two new ranks within the Climacoceridae family: the Climacocerinae and the Prolibytheriinae. (3) Preliminary systematics suggest that Giraffidae can be subdivided into two clades: the long and the short neck groups. The Siwaliks sample a total of twelve different giraffids: Progiraffa exigua, Giraffokeryx punjabiensis, Ua pilbeami, Orea leptia, Injanatherium hazimi, Giraffa punjabiensis, Giraffa sivalensis, Decennatherium asiaticum, Bramatherium megacephalum, Bramatherium perminese, Bamiscus micros, and Sivatherium giganteum. Palaeotragus germanii and Bohlinia tungurensis are new determinations. Progiraffinae and Bramatheriinae as new subfamilies. The subfamilies of Giraffidae seem to hold as isolated evolutionary silos. They are: Progiraffinae, Giraffokerycinae, Okapiinae, Bohlininae, Giraffinae, Palaeotraginae, Samotheriinae, Bramatheriinae and Sivatheriinae. It is hard to connect these subfamilies as they most appear around 15 Ma.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ovules or seeds (fertilized ovules) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in wind dispersal and probable photosynthetic nutrition. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.</p>
