Authors: Paramo Blazquez, A.; Mocho, P.; Escaso, F.; Ortega, F.
Score: 15.5, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560839
AbstractThe sauropod hind limb is the main support that allowed their gigantic body masses and a wide range of dynamic stability adaptations. It is closely related with the position of the centre of masses of their multi-toned barrel-shaped bodies, and experiences one of the most noticeable posture changes along macronarian evolution.">

It is closely related with the position of the centre of masses of their multi-toned barrel-shaped bodies, and experiences one of the most noticeable posture changes along macronarian evolution. Deeply-branched macronaria achieve increasingly arched hind limbs in what it is known as wide-gauge posture. However, it is not clear if this evolutionary trend is related to the evolutionary cascade toward gigantism despite some titanosaurian were the largest terrestrial vertebrates ever-existed. We tested through means of 3D geometric morphometrics for evolutionary changes in hind limb morphology along Macronaria phylogenetic tree. The macronarian hind limb does become progressively more arched toward deeply-branched Saltasauridae. However, there is morphological convergence between different subclades. Wide-gauge posture does not correlate with changes in body size deeper in the macronarian evolutionary tree, acting as exaptation to gigantism. Despite some titanosaurian subclades becoming some of the largest vertebrates, there is a phyletic body size decrease in Macronaria.\nEstimating body volumes and surface areas of animalsfrom cross-sections\nAuthors: Zhao, R. J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.562315\nBody mass and surface area are among the most important biological properties, but such information are lacking for some extant organisms and all extinct species. Numerous methods have been developed for body size estimation for this reason. There are two main categories of mass-estimating methods: volumetric-density approaches and extant-scaling approaches. In this paper, a new 2D volumetric-density approach named cross-sectional method is presented. Cross-sectional method integrates biological cross-sections to obtain volume and surface area accurately. Unlike all previous 2D methods, cross-sectional method processes true cross-sectional profiles directly rather than approximating. Cross-sectional method also has the advantage over others that it can deal with objects with gradually changing cross-sections. It generates very accurate results, with errors always lower than 2% in all cases tested.\nLow-invasive sampling method for taxonomic for the identification of archaeological and paleontological bones by proteomics of their collagens\nAuthors: Fabrizi, I.; Flament, S.; Rolando, C.; Delhon, C.; Gourichon, L.; Vuillien, M.; Oueslati, T.; Auguste, P.; Bray, F.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-10-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.18.562897\nCollagen from paleontological bones is an important organic material for isotopic measurement, radiocarbon and paleoproteomic analyzes, to provide information on diet, dating and taxonomy. Current paleoproteomics methods are destructive and require from a few milligrams to several tenths of milligrams of bone for analysis. In many cultures, bones are raw materials for artefact which are conserved in museum which hampers to damage these precious objects during sampling. Here, we describe a low-invasive sampling method that identifies collagen, taxonomy and post-translational modifications from Holocene and Upper Pleistocene bones dated to 130,000 and 150 BC using dermatological skin tape-discs for sampling. The sampled bone micro-powders were digested following our highly optimized eFASP protocol, then analyzed by MALDI FTICR MS and LC-MS/MS for identifying the genus taxa of the bones. We show that this low-invasive sampling does not deteriorate the bones and achieves results similar to those obtained by more destructive sampling. Moreover, this sampling method can be performed at archaeological sites or in museums.\n",
