  "articleBody": " Nanoscale Imaging and Microanalysis of Ice Age Bone Offers New Perspective on 'Subfossils' and Fossilization\nAuthors: Anderson, L. A.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570041\nThe 3-D structure and organization of type-1 collagen protein and vasculature for a set of ancient permafrost bones is extensively documented at the nanoscale (up to 150,000x magnification) for the first time. The chemical mapping technique ToF-SIMS is additionally used to directly localize chemical signal to these structures; C:N and isotope measurements are also reported for the bulk organic bone matrix. These analyses test the hypothesis that biomolecular histology of collagen and vasculature from the permafrost bones supports their taphonomic classification as \"subfossils\" rather than \"fossils\". Results indicate the original collagenous scaffolding and vasculature are still present, the former of which is well-preserved, thus supporting the hypothesis. This study is the first to taphonomically classify a set of pre-Holocene bones as \"subfossils\" based on the preserved state of their biomolecular histology. These methods can be readily expanded to specimens of warmer thermal settings and earlier geologic strata. Doing so has potential to establish/formalize at what point a bone has been truly \"fossilized\"; that is, when it has transitioned from \"subfossil\" status to being a true \"fossil\" bone. This will elucidate the fossilization process for ancient vertebrates and lead to a deeper understanding of what it means to be a \"fossil\".\nA Glimpse Into the Cenomanian: Palynology of the Arlington Archosaur Site, Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, Texas, USA\nAuthors: Lorente, M. A.; Noto, C.; Flaig, P.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.569281\nThe Arlington Archosaur Site (AAS) between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, is known as a rich fossiliferous section. The age of these rocks is generally considered to be mid-Cenomanian, but conflicting evidence suggests the age may be as young as the late Cenomanian-early Turonian. To address the issue, a palynological study was designed and conducted based on the close sampling of the lithofacies. Palynological samples were processed according to the standard acid preparation. The study was quantitative and focused on associations to determine the paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, biostratigraphy, and age of exposure. The rich palynological assemblages comprise spores from seedless plants, gymnosperms, angiosperms, fungi, algae, and dinoflagellate cysts. Bryophytes were abundant mainly in Facies A and B, with Zlivisporis cenomanianus taking over the bryophytes habitat in Facies D. Lycophytes abundant in the alluvial and coastal plains are considered to have been transported. Conifers were the predominant group of gymnosperms, also mainly transported into the section. Freshwater algal remains include Schizophacus laevigatus/Ovoidites parvus, Schizosporis reticulatus, Botryococcus sp., and Pediastrum sp. Acanthomorph acritarchs present in low abundance and diversity appear following shallow marine dinoflagellates spikes and before freshwater colonial algal spikes. The vegetation signal at Notos Facies A and B indicates tropical to subtropical shallow marine to coastal plains, while Notos Facies D indicates tidally influenced areas. Also, picks of the diversity and abundance of dinoflagellate cysts are interpreted as an increased marine influence and proposed as possible flooding surfaces. The results support the alternation of marine incursions within deltaic and floodplain sequences, related to regional climate oscillation that affected the vegetation on the upland drainage area. Key palynological markers point to an early Late Cenomanian age, and the presence of the Cyclonephelium compactum-C. membraniphorum (Ccm morphological plexus) signals that the incursion of boreal waters during the Plenus Cold Event of the Ocean Anoxic Event 2 may have reached as far south as the AAS area. This coincides with vegetation trends that suggest a cooler and less humid climate at the start of Facies A, where Ccm is more abundant.\n",
