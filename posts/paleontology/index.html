P.; Jones, A.; Giles, S.; Lanzetti, A.; Grohganz, M.; Johanson, Z.; Lautenschlager, S.; Randle, E.; Donoghue, P.; Sansom, I. J.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-08-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554283\nAttempts to explain the origin and diversification of vertebrates have commonly invoked the evolution of feeding ecology, contrasting the passive suspension feeding of invertebrate chordate and larval lampreys with active predation in living jawed vertebrates. Of the extinct jawless vertebrates that phylogenetically intercalate these living groups, the feeding apparatus is preserved only in the early diverging stem-gnathostome heterostracans, and its anatomy remains poorly understood. Here we use X-ray microtomography to characterise the feeding apparatus of the pteraspid heterostracan Rhinopteraspis dunensis (Roemer, 1855). We show that the apparatus is comprised of thirteen plates arranged approximately bilaterally, the majority of which articulate from the postoral plate, except those close to the midline which are shorter and must have floated in soft tissue. Our reconstruction of the apparatus shows that these plates would have been capable of movement within the dorso-ventral plane, but this was likely limited. The functional morphology of the apparatus in Rhinopteraspis precludes all proposed interpretations of feeding except for suspension feeding and we interpret the apparatus as having served primarily to moderate the oral gape. This is consistent with evidence that at least some early jawless gnathostomes were suspension feeders, a proposition based previously only on disarticulated parts of the heterostracan oral apparatus, and runs contrary to ideas of the earliest vertebrates as predators. However, body shape and the position of the mouth varies considerably in heterostracans, and analyses based on individual pteraspid taxa may not capture the diversity of feeding in the group.\nLonger mandible or nose? Co-evolution of feeding organs in early elephantiforms\nAuthors: Li, C.; Deng, T.; Wang, Y.; Sun, F.; Wolff, B.; Jiangzuo, Q.; Ma, J.; Xing, L.; Fu, J.; Zhang, J.; Wang, S.\nScore: 4.0, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553347\nThe long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the Platybelodon clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends.\nThe pharynx of the iconic stem-group chondrichthyan Acanthodes (Agassiz, 1833) revisited with micro computed tomography.\nAuthors: Dearden, R. P.; Herrel, A.; Pradel, A.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.554409\nAcanthodes has long been the primary source of information on the pharyngeal skeleton of acanthodians, a stem-group chondrichthyan grade. Because of this its anatomy has played an outsized role in attempts to understand the evolution of the jawed vertebrate pharynx and the clade as a whole. However, the anatomy of the pharynx of Acanthodes remains poorly understood and subject to several competing interpretations. We use computed tomography (CT) to image the articulated pharyngeal skeletons of three specimens of Acanthodes confusus from Lebach, Germany. Acanthodes had a melange of osteichthyan-like and chondrichthyan-like morphologies in its pharyngeal skeleton. Like other stem-chondrichthyans, Acanthodes had a basihyal with no hypohyals, and four pairs of posteriorly oriented pharyngobranchials. Like osteichthyans, Acanthodes possessed an interhyal, but lacked the separate infra- and supra-pharyngobranchial elements present in osteichthyans and the crown-chondrichthyan Ozarcus. Using this new data we build and animated a digital 3D model of the pharyngeal endoskeleton in Acanthodes, showing that the jaws would have swung outwards during the opening cycle, increasing the anteriorly facing area of the gape for suspension feeding. These new data provide a more definitive picture of the anatomy of a taxon that has long been of great significance in early vertebrate palaeontology.\n",

Like osteichthyans, Acanthodes possessed an interhyal, but lacked the separate infra- and supra-pharyngobranchial elements present in osteichthyans and the crown-chondrichthyan Ozarcus. Using this new data we build and animated a digital 3D model of the pharyngeal endoskeleton in Acanthodes, showing that the jaws would have swung outwards during the opening cycle, increasing the anteriorly facing area of the gape for suspension feeding. These new data provide a more definitive picture of the anatomy of a taxon that has long been of great significance in early vertebrate palaeontology.</p>
