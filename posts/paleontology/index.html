Achondroplasia (ACH, achondroplastic dwarfism) represents the most common form of skeletal dysplasia, occurring in c. 4 out of every 100,000 births. This study presents a computer-based facial approximation of the skull of a male individual suffering from ACH, who died at 30-45 years of age and was buried in ekno, Poland between the 9th and 11th centuries AD.">

This study presents a computer-based facial approximation of the skull of a male individual suffering from ACH, who died at 30-45 years of age and was buried in ekno, Poland between the 9th and 11th centuries AD. For the approximation procedure, soft tissue data from CT scans and ultrasonic measurements performed on living individuals were used. Additionally, the anatomical deformation technique was applied to arrive at the most reliable reconstruction of the dwarfs appearance. To our knowledge, this is the first recreation of a person with achondroplasia, and one of the few showing a head of an individual suffering from a hereditary disease, with dimensions and shape differing from the population average values. Highlights- Forensic facial approximation of an achondroplastic dwarf from 9th-11th century AD has been performed as the first in the world - The applied procedure included CT of a virtual donor - Anatomical deformation technique allowed to extract the endocast, revealing a large volume of the endocranium - Few measurements applied to the facial skeleton proved successful in identification of a person suffering from achondroplasia\nThe three-dimensionally articulated oral apparatus of a Devonian heterostracan sheds light on feeding in Palaeozoic jawless fishes\nAuthors: Dearden, R.

Of the extinct jawless vertebrates that phylogenetically intercalate these living groups, the feeding apparatus is preserved only in the early diverging stem-gnathostome heterostracans, and its anatomy remains poorly understood. Here we use X-ray microtomography to characterise the feeding apparatus of the pteraspid heterostracan Rhinopteraspis dunensis (Roemer, 1855). We show that the apparatus is comprised of thirteen plates arranged approximately bilaterally, the majority of which articulate from the postoral plate, except those close to the midline which are shorter and must have floated in soft tissue. Our reconstruction of the apparatus shows that these plates would have been capable of movement within the dorso-ventral plane, but this was likely limited. The functional morphology of the apparatus in Rhinopteraspis precludes all proposed interpretations of feeding except for suspension feeding and we interpret the apparatus as having served primarily to moderate the oral gape. This is consistent with evidence that at least some early jawless gnathostomes were suspension feeders, a proposition based previously only on disarticulated parts of the heterostracan oral apparatus, and runs contrary to ideas of the earliest vertebrates as predators. However, body shape and the position of the mouth varies considerably in heterostracans, and analyses based on individual pteraspid taxa may not capture the diversity of feeding in the group.\n",
