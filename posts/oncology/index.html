  "articleBody": " An elevated rate of whole-genome duplication events in cancers from Black patients\nAuthors: Brown, L. M.; Hagenson, R. A.; Sheltzer, J. M.\nScore: 35.0, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298349\nIn the United States, Black individuals have higher rates of cancer mortality than any other racial or ethnic group. The sources of these significant racial disparities are not fully understood, and may include social, environmental, and genetic factors that influence cancer onset, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we examined genomic data from several large-scale cancer patient cohorts to search for racial associations in chromosome copy number alterations. We found that tumors from Black patients were significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from white patients. Among patients with WGD-positive cancers, there was no significant difference in survival between Black and white patients, suggesting that the increased incidence of WGD events could contribute to the disparities in patient outcome. Genomic analysis identified several somatic alterations associated with WGD events that were consistent between Black and white populations, indicating that the increase in WGD events may be driven by environmental or epigenetic factors in Black patients. In total, these findings identify a class of genomic alterations that may influence racial disparities in cancer patient outcome. As cancers that have undergone WGD events exhibit unique genetic vulnerabilities, therapies that selectively target WGD-positive cancers may be particularly effective at treating aggressive malignancies in Black patients.\nSpatial proteo-transcriptomic profiling reveals the molecular landscape of borderline ovarian tumors and their invasive progression\nAuthors: Schweizer, L.; Krishnan, R.; Shimizu, A.; Metousis, A.; Kenny, H.; Mendoza, R.; Nordmann, T. M.; Rauch, S.; Kelliher, L.; Heide, J.; Rosenberger, F. A.; Bilecz, A.; Borrego, S. N.; Strauss, M. T.; Thielert, M.; Rodriguez, E.; Mueller-Reif, J. B.; Chen, M.; Yamada, S. D.; Mund, A.; Lastra, R.; Mann, M.; Lengyel, E.\nScore: 1.9, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.23298409\nSerous borderline tumors (SBT) are epithelial neoplastic lesions of the ovaries that commonly have a good prognosis. In 10-15% of cases, however, SBT will recur as low-grade serous cancer (LGSC), which is deeply invasive and responds poorly to current standard chemotherapy1,2,3. While genetic alterations suggest a common origin, the transition from SBT to LGSC remains poorly understood4. Here, we integrate spatial proteomics5 with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the evolution from SBT to LGSC and its corresponding metastasis at the molecular level in both the stroma and the tumor. We show that the transition of SBT to LGSC occurs in the epithelial compartment through an intermediary stage with micropapillary features (SBT-MP), which involves a gradual increase in MAPK signaling. A distinct subset of proteins and transcripts was associated with the transition to invasive tumor growth, including the neuronal splicing factor NOVA2, which was limited to expression in LGSC and its corresponding metastasis. An integrative pathway analysis exposed aberrant molecular signaling of tumor cells supported by alterations in angiogenesis and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Integration of spatial transcriptomics and proteomics followed by knockdown of the most altered genes or pharmaceutical inhibition of the most relevant targets confirmed their functional significance in regulating key features of invasiveness. Combining cell-type resolved spatial proteomics and transcriptomics allowed us to elucidate the sequence of tumorigenesis from SBT to LGSC. The approach presented here is a blueprint to systematically elucidate mechanisms of tumorigenesis and find novel treatment strategies.\nEvolutionary dynamics of 1,976 lymphoid malignancies predict clinical outcome\nAuthors: Gabbutt, C.; Duran-Ferrer, M.; Grant, H.; Mallo, D.; Nadeu, F.; Househam, J.; Villamor, N.; Krali, O.; Nordlund, J.; Zenz, T.; Campo, E.; Lopez-Guillermo, A.; Fitzgibbon, J.; Barnes, C. P.; Shibata, D.; Martin-Subero, J. I.; Graham, T. A.\nScore: 44.2, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298336\nCancer development, progression, and response to treatment are evolutionary processes, but characterising the evolutionary dynamics at sufficient scale to be clinically-meaningful has remained challenging. Here, we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based upon natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterised lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that tumour growth rates, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe that tumour growth rates are higher in more aggressive disease subtypes, and in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients, evolutionary histories are independent prognostic factors. Phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal CLL samples using EVOFLUx detect the seeds of future Richter transformation many decades prior to presentation. We provide orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences using additional genetic and clinical data. Collectively, we show how widely-available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measures cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.\nValidation and Responsiveness of the English version of the Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia Distress Scale (CADS) in Breast Cancer Patients.\nAuthors: Kraehenbuehl, L.; Kang, D.; Bang, A. S.; Ketosugbo, K. F.; Hay, J.; Patil, S.; Goldfarb, S.; Cho, J.; Lacouture, M. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.23298093\nPurposeThis study aimed to validate the chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress scale (CADS) in a diverse English-speaking population and patients with endocrine treatment- induced alopecia (EIA). ObjectiveChemotherapy and endocrine therapy commonly cause alopecia in breast cancer patients, leading to significant psychological and social challenges. The CADS was developed to assess the psychosocial impact of alopecia, but its generalizability beyond Korean patients requires further investigation. MethodsData from the CHANCE study (NCT02530177), which focused on non-metastatic breast cancer, was used. The cohort included 256 patients, and CADS data were collected at baseline, six months after chemotherapy completion, or 12 months after initiating endocrine therapy. The CADS questionnaire comprised 17 items covering physical and emotional health, daily activities, and relationships. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha, and responsiveness was measured by effect size. ResultsThe CADS exhibited good reliability, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.91 for the overall score, indicating acceptable internal consistency in both chemotherapy (0.89) and endocrine therapy (0.86) groups. Longitudinal responsiveness was supported by an effect size of 0.49 between decreasing satisfaction with hair growth and increasing emotional distress. Cross-sectional validity was confirmed, with effect sizes of 0.91 and 0.92 for satisfaction with hair growth and emotional and activity domains, respectively. ConclusionThe CADS is a valid and responsive tool for assessing the psychosocial impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia and endocrine treatment-induced alopecia in a diverse Western patient population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cancer development, progression, and response to treatment are evolutionary processes, but characterising the evolutionary dynamics at sufficient scale to be clinically-meaningful has remained challenging. Here, we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based upon natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterised lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that tumour growth rates, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe that tumour growth rates are higher in more aggressive disease subtypes, and in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients, evolutionary histories are independent prognostic factors. Phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal CLL samples using EVOFLUx detect the seeds of future Richter transformation many decades prior to presentation. We provide orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences using additional genetic and clinical data. Collectively, we show how widely-available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measures cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThis study aimed to validate the chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress scale (CADS) in a diverse English-speaking population and patients with endocrine treatment- induced alopecia (EIA).

ObjectiveChemotherapy and endocrine therapy commonly cause alopecia in breast cancer patients, leading to significant psychological and social challenges. The CADS was developed to assess the psychosocial impact of alopecia, but its generalizability beyond Korean patients requires further investigation.

MethodsData from the CHANCE study (NCT02530177), which focused on non-metastatic breast cancer, was used. The cohort included 256 patients, and CADS data were collected at baseline, six months after chemotherapy completion, or 12 months after initiating endocrine therapy. The CADS questionnaire comprised 17 items covering physical and emotional health, daily activities, and relationships. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha, and responsiveness was measured by effect size.

ResultsThe CADS exhibited good reliability, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.91 for the overall score, indicating acceptable internal consistency in both chemotherapy (0.89) and endocrine therapy (0.86) groups. Longitudinal responsiveness was supported by an effect size of 0.49 between decreasing satisfaction with hair growth and increasing emotional distress. Cross-sectional validity was confirmed, with effect sizes of 0.91 and 0.92 for satisfaction with hair growth and emotional and activity domains, respectively.

ConclusionThe CADS is a valid and responsive tool for assessing the psychosocial impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia and endocrine treatment-induced alopecia in a diverse Western patient population.</p>
