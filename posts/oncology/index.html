Despite recent advances in the understanding of molecular alterations in CRC, the representation of South Asians in published genomic datasets is very limited. To address this gap, we performed a pilot study based on a transnational collaboration between academic centers in the US and Pakistan to characterize copy number alterations in a Pakistani cohort with CRC. MethodsWe obtained archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 43 CRC patients treated at Aga Khan University (AKU) Hospital. DNA was extracted and evaluated for quality at AKU, and whole genome sequencing library preparation and shallow whole genome sequencing was performed at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Sequencing data was aligned to the human genome, and we used ichorCNA and GISTIC2 to determine relative copy number alterations. ResultsAfter removing 13 samples with insufficient DNA quality or quantity, tumor sequencing data was analyzed from 30 patients. The cohort consisted of 19 (63.3%) males with a mean age of 50.1 years and standard deviation (SD) of 17.8 years. Twenty-one (70.0%) patients had tumor stage T3 or T4, and 15 (50.0%) had tumors of the colon. A mean of 265 ng (SD, 29 ng) of DNA was extracted from each FFPE tumor sample, and each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of 0.22x (0.21x). Analysis of copy number alterations revealed recurrent gains in regions 8q and 13q, as well as losses in region 8p. ConclusionsThis transnational pilot study helped identify the challenges related to FFPE sample quality that can impede similar efforts in the future. Our results revealed similarities in the most common copy number alterations in CRC identified in native Pakistani patients and published datasets.\nExploring novel inflammation-related genetic and hematological predictors of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer\nAuthors: Marinkovic, M.; Stojanovic-Rundic, S.; Stanojevic, A.; Ostojic, M.; Gavrilovic, D.; Jankovic, R.; Maksimovic, N.; Stroggilos, R.; Zoidakis, J.; Castellvi-Bel, S.; Fijneman, R. J. A.; Cavic, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.23291673\nBackgroundThe standard initial treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). In order to select patients who would benefit the most from nCRT, there is a strong need for predictive biomarkers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of clinical, pathological, radiological, inflammation-related genetic, and hematological parameters in the prediction of response after nCRT. MethodsIn silico analysis of published transcriptomics datasets was conducted to identify the best candidate genes, whose expression will be measured using quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in pretreatment formaline-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. In this study, 75 patients with LARC, between June 2020 and January 2022, were prospectively included. Patients were assessed for tumor response in the 8th week after nCRT completion with pelvic MRI scan and rigid proctoscopy. For patients with a clinical complete response (cCR) and initially distant located tumor no immediate surgery was suggested (\"watch and wait\" approach). The response after surgery was assessed using histopathological tumor regression grading (TRG) categories from postoperative specimens by Mandard. Responders (R) were defined as patients with cCR without operative treatment, and those with TRG 1 and TRG 2 postoperative categories. Non-responders (NR) were patients classified as TRG 3-5. ResultsResponders group comprised 35 patients (46.6%) and NR group included 53.4% of patients. Analysis of published transcriptomics data identified genes that could predict response to treatment and their significance was assessed in our cohort by qRT-PCR. When comparison was made in the subgroup of patients who were operated (TRG1 vs. TRG4), the expression of IDO1 was significantly deregulated (p\u003c0.05). Among hematological parameters between R and NR a significant difference in the response was detected for neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), initial basophil, eosinophil and monocyte counts (p\u003c0.01). According to MRI findings, non-responders were more often presented with extramural vascular invasion (p\u003c0.05). ConclusionBased on logistic regression model, factors associated with favorable response to nCRT were found to be tumor morphology as well as hematological parameters which can be easily and routinely derived from initial laboratory results (NMR, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts) in a minimally invasive manner. Using various metrics, an aggregated score of the initial eosinophil, basophil, and monocyte counts demonstrated the best predictive performance.\n",
