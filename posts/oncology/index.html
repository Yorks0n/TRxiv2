M.\nScore: 32.5, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298349\nIn the United States, Black individuals have higher rates of cancer mortality than any other racial or ethnic group. The sources of these significant racial disparities are not fully understood, and may include social, environmental, and genetic factors that influence cancer onset, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we examined genomic data from several large-scale cancer patient cohorts to search for racial associations in chromosome copy number alterations. We found that tumors from Black patients were significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from white patients. Among patients with WGD-positive cancers, there was no significant difference in survival between Black and white patients, suggesting that the increased incidence of WGD events could contribute to the disparities in patient outcome. Genomic analysis identified several somatic alterations associated with WGD events that were consistent between Black and white populations, indicating that the increase in WGD events may be driven by environmental or epigenetic factors in Black patients. In total, these findings identify a class of genomic alterations that may influence racial disparities in cancer patient outcome. As cancers that have undergone WGD events exhibit unique genetic vulnerabilities, therapies that selectively target WGD-positive cancers may be particularly effective at treating aggressive malignancies in Black patients.\nA multidimensional analysis reveals distinct immune phenotypes and tertiary lymphoid structure-like aggregates in the bone marrow of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia\nAuthors: Koedijk, J.

M.; Heidenreich, O.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.03.23286485\nBecause of the low mutational burden, children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are thought to have a cold tumor microenvironment and consequently, a low likelihood of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies. Here, we provide a multidimensional overview of the tumor immune microenvironment in newly diagnosed pediatric AML. On a cohort level, we demonstrate wide variation in T cell infiltration with nearly one-third of cases harboring an immune-infiltrated bone marrow. These immune-infiltrated cases are characterized by a decreased abundance of M2-like macrophages, which we find to be associated with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in adult AML. On an organizational level, we reveal the composition of spatially organized immune aggregates in pediatric AML, and show that in the adult setting such aggregates in post-treatment bone marrow and extramedullary sites associate with response to ipilimumab-based therapy. Altogether, our study provides immune correlates of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies and indicates starting points for further investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML. Statement of significanceThe limited response rates to T cell-directed immunotherapies remain a major challenge in AML. This study reveals the spatial organization of the tumor immune microenvironment in pediatric AML, identifies that immune aggregates associate with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in the adult setting, and provides starting points for future investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML.\n",
