K.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295748\nObjectiveBrain metastases (BM) are associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality rates, making them a significant clinical challenge. Therefore, studying BMs can aid in developing better diagnostic tools for their early detection and monitoring. Systematic comparisons of anatomical distributions of BM from different primary cancers, however, remain largely unavailable. MethodsTo test the hypothesis that anatomical BM distributions differ based on primary cancer type, we analyze the spatial coordinates of BMs for five different primary cancer types along principal component (PC) axes which optimizes their largest spread along each of the three PC axes. Data used in this analysis is taken from the International Radiosurgery Research Foundation (IRRF) and all patients underwent gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for the treatment of BMs which are labeled based on the primary cancer types Breast, Lung, Melanoma, Renal, and Colon. The dataset consists of six features including sex, age, target volume, and stereotactic Cartesian coordinates X, Y, and Z of a total of 3949 intracranial metastases. We employ PC coordinates to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset and highlight the distinctions in the anatomical spread of BMs between various cancer types. We utilized different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and TabNet Deep Learning (DL) model to establish the relationship between primary cancer diagnosis, spatial coordinates of BMs, age, and target volume. ResultsOur findings demonstrate that the first principal component (PC1) exhibits a greater alignment with the Y axis, followed by the Z axis, with a minimal correlation observed with the X axis. Based on our analysis of the PC1 versus PC2 plots, we have determined that the pairs of Breast and Lung cancer, as well as Breast and Renal cancer, exhibit the most notable distinctions in their anatomical spreading patterns. In contrast, we find that the pairs of Renal and Lung cancer, as well as Lung and Melanoma, were most similar in their patterns. Our ML and DL results indicate high accuracy in distinguishing the distribution of BM for different primary cancers, with the SVM algorithm achieving a 97% accuracy rate when using a polynomial kernel and TabNet a 96% accuracy. The RF algorithm ranks PC1 as the most important discriminating feature. ConclusionsTaken together, the results demonstrate an accurate multiclass machine learning classification with respect to the distribution of brain metastases.\nDNA mismatch repair gene variant classification: evaluating the utility of somatic mutations and mismatch repair deficient colonic crypts and endometrial glands\nAuthors: Walker, R.; Mahmood, K.; Como, J.; Clendenning, M.; Joo, J.

M.; Buchanan, D. D.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23295173\nGermline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) predispose to colorectal (CRC) and endometrial (EC) cancer. Lynch syndrome specific tumor features were evaluated for their ability to support the ACMG/InSiGHT framework in classifying variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in the MMR genes. Twenty-eight CRC or EC tumors from 25 VUS carriers (6xMLH1, 9xMSH2, 6xMSH6, 4xPMS2), underwent targeted tumor sequencing for the presence of microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency (MSI-H/dMMR) status and identification of a somatic MMR mutation (second hit). Immunohistochemical testing for the presence of dMMR crypts/glands in normal tissue was also performed. The ACMG/InSiGHT framework reclassified 7/25 (28%) VUS to likely pathogenic (LP), three (12%) to benign/likely benign, and 15 (60%) VUS remained unchanged. For the seven re-classified LP variants comprising nine tumors, tumor sequencing confirmed MSI-H/dMMR (8/9, 88.9%) and a second hit (7/9, 77.8%). Of these LP reclassified variants where normal tissue was available, the presence of a dMMR crypt/gland was found in 2/4 (50%). Furthermore, a dMMR endometrial gland in a carrier of an MSH2 exon 1-6 duplication provided further support for upgrade of this VUS to LP. Our study confirmed that identifying these Lynch syndrome features can improve MMR variant classification, enabling optimal clinical care. Simple SummaryLynch syndrome is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes predisposing carriers to colorectal and endometrial cancer. Genetic testing for Lynch syndrome, in the form of multigene panel testing, frequently identifies variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). These VUS have limited clinical actionability and create uncertainty for patients and clinicians regarding their risk of cancer. In this study, we tested carriers of germline VUS for features consistent with Lynch syndrome, namely 1) tumor microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency, 2) the presence of a somatic second hit in the MMR gene harboring the VUS by tumor sequencing and 3) the presence of MMR-deficiency in normal colonic mucosa crypts or normal endometrial glands. Our findings showed that microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency status and somatic second hits were consistent with MMR variant classifications as determined by the ACMG/InSiGHT framework. In addition to this, the presence of MMR-deficient crypts/glands were consistent with pathogenic variant classification.\nQualitative exploration of patients' experiences with Intrabeam targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) and External-Beam Radiotherapy Treatment (EBRT).\nAuthors: Bagga, S. K.; Swiderska, N.; Hooker, C.; Ennis-O'Connor, M.; Freeney, S.; Watson, D.; Woolcock, R.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295478\nFor patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy is given either as a post-operative course of External-Beam RadioTherapy (EBRT), given daily for over a number of days and often weeks, or with TARGeted Intrabeam Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT), which is delivered, during surgery under the same anaesthetic. Several studies have reported the quantitative Quality-of-Life (QoL) benefits of TARGIT-IORT over EBRT. This qualitative study was designed to gather a deep understanding of the benefits and impacts of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT as perceived by patients. It also captured how differently the treatments affected the lived experience of the patient and their care partner through their treatment journey. A patient-led Working Group was established to guide study design, delivery and to help validate findings. Patients with experience of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT were first purposively sampled by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after which a randomiser was applied to ensure the final selection process was free from bias. In February and March 2023, 29 semi-structured interviews (15 EBRT, 14 TARGIT-IORT) were conducted virtually via Zoom. Thematic analysis of verbatim interview transcripts was then carried out by two coders generating 11 themes related to either EBRT or TARGIT-IORT. A number of procedural grievances were noted among EBRT patients. EBRT was perceived as being disruptive to a range of normal routines (work, home-life, and the burden of travel), and dissatisfying due to discomfort of side effects. TARGIT-IORT was perceived by patients and care partners as being efficient (given while they are asleep during surgery and without additional hospital visits) with minimal if any disruptions to QoL and that it was the safer option. The need for adequate, accessible information provision at the right time to reduce anxieties was noted in both cohorts. These new insights are valuable for healthcare staff and policy makers and could help incorporate the two treatments into routine practice. Further research is now needed to explore TARGIT-IORT in more diverse populations and in the 35 other countries where it is already a well- established treatment option.\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphic variants in rectal cancer: significance for cancer risk and response to chemoradiotherapy\nAuthors: Stanojevic, A.; Spasic, J.; Marinkovic, M.; Stojanovic-Rundic, S.; Jankovic, R.; Djuric, A.; Zoidakis, J.; Fijneman, R.; Castellvi-Bel, S.; Cavic, M.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295916\nBackgroundMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been suggested as risk, prognostic, and predictive factors for colorectal cancer in various populations, but have not been validated so far. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) small nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of rectal cancer as well as the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) based on 5-Fluorouracil (5- FU)/leucovorin (LV) in the locally advanced setting. Patients and methodsA total of 102 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 119 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) was used for MTHFR genotyping ResultsUsing dominant and recessive models, it was found that the MTHFR 667C allele and the 1298A allele were significantly associated with rectal cancer as low-penetrant factors. Combined genotype analysis highlighted the protective role of the 677CT/1298AC genotype and increased risk for rectal cancer development for carriers of 677CC/1298AA. Haplotype analysis indicated that carriers of haplotype 677C/1298A have an increased risk for rectal cancer development while the haplotype 677T/1298A has a protective role. No significant association with response to chemoradiotherapy was found ConclusionOur data point to MTHFR 667C allele and 1298A alleles as low-penetrant risk factors for rectal cancer in our population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this type performed on the Slavic population in the Western Balkan area which might be useful for future meta-analyses and the construction of genetic cancer risk prediction panels, as various population-based factors might also be significant in this setting.\nDeep Learning Model for Tumor Type Prediction using Targeted Clinical Genomic Sequencing Data\nAuthors: Darmofal, M.; Suman, S.; Atwal, G.; Chen, J.-F.; Chang, J. C.; Toomey, M.; Vakiani, E.; Varghese, A. M.; Balakrishnan Rema, A.; Syed, A.; Schultz, N.; Berger, M.; Morris, Q.\nScore: 17.7, Published: 2023-09-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295131\nTumor type guides clinical treatment decisions in cancer, but histology-based diagnosis remains challenging. Genomic alterations are highly diagnostic of tumor type, and tumor type classifiers trained on genomic features have been explored, but the most accurate methods are not clinically feasible, relying on features derived from whole genome sequencing (WGS), or predicting across limited cancer types. We use genomic features from a dataset of 39,787 solid tumors sequenced using a clinical targeted cancer gene panel to develop Genome-Derived-Diagnosis Ensemble (GDD-ENS): a hyperparameter ensemble for classifying tumor type using deep neural networks. GDD-ENS achieves 93% accuracy for high-confidence predictions across 38 cancer types, rivalling performance of WGS-based methods. GDD-ENS can also guide diagnoses on rare type and cancers of unknown primary, and incorporate patient-specific clinical information for improved predictions. Overall, integrating GDD-ENS into prospective clinical sequencing workflows has enabled clinically-relevant tumor type predictions to guide treatment decisions in real time.\n",

We employ PC coordinates to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset and highlight the distinctions in the anatomical spread of BMs between various cancer types. We utilized different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and TabNet Deep Learning (DL) model to establish the relationship between primary cancer diagnosis, spatial coordinates of BMs, age, and target volume.

ResultsOur findings demonstrate that the first principal component (PC1) exhibits a greater alignment with the Y axis, followed by the Z axis, with a minimal correlation observed with the X axis. Based on our analysis of the PC1 versus PC2 plots, we have determined that the pairs of Breast and Lung cancer, as well as Breast and Renal cancer, exhibit the most notable distinctions in their anatomical spreading patterns. In contrast, we find that the pairs of Renal and Lung cancer, as well as Lung and Melanoma, were most similar in their patterns. Our ML and DL results indicate high accuracy in distinguishing the distribution of BM for different primary cancers, with the SVM algorithm achieving a 97% accuracy rate when using a polynomial kernel and TabNet a 96% accuracy. The RF algorithm ranks PC1 as the most important discriminating feature.

ConclusionsTaken together, the results demonstrate an accurate multiclass machine learning classification with respect to the distribution of brain metastases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Germline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (Lynch syndrome) predispose to colorectal (CRC) and endometrial (EC) cancer. Lynch syndrome specific tumor features were evaluated for their ability to support the ACMG/InSiGHT framework in classifying variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in the MMR genes. Twenty-eight CRC or EC tumors from 25 VUS carriers (6xMLH1, 9xMSH2, 6xMSH6, 4xPMS2), underwent targeted tumor sequencing for the presence of microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency (MSI-H/dMMR) status and identification of a somatic MMR mutation (second hit). Immunohistochemical testing for the presence of dMMR crypts/glands in normal tissue was also performed. The ACMG/InSiGHT framework reclassified 7/25 (28%) VUS to likely pathogenic (LP), three (12%) to benign/likely benign, and 15 (60%) VUS remained unchanged. For the seven re-classified LP variants comprising nine tumors, tumor sequencing confirmed MSI-H/dMMR (8/9, 88.9%) and a second hit (7/9, 77.8%). Of these LP reclassified variants where normal tissue was available, the presence of a dMMR crypt/gland was found in 2/4 (50%). Furthermore, a dMMR endometrial gland in a carrier of an MSH2 exon 1-6 duplication provided further support for upgrade of this VUS to LP. Our study confirmed that identifying these Lynch syndrome features can improve MMR variant classification, enabling optimal clinical care.

Simple SummaryLynch syndrome is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes predisposing carriers to colorectal and endometrial cancer. Genetic testing for Lynch syndrome, in the form of multigene panel testing, frequently identifies variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). These VUS have limited clinical actionability and create uncertainty for patients and clinicians regarding their risk of cancer. In this study, we tested carriers of germline VUS for features consistent with Lynch syndrome, namely 1) tumor microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency, 2) the presence of a somatic second hit in the MMR gene harboring the VUS by tumor sequencing and 3) the presence of MMR-deficiency in normal colonic mucosa crypts or normal endometrial glands. Our findings showed that microsatellite instability/MMR-deficiency status and somatic second hits were consistent with MMR variant classifications as determined by the ACMG/InSiGHT framework. In addition to this, the presence of MMR-deficient crypts/glands were consistent with pathogenic variant classification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy is given either as a post-operative course of External-Beam RadioTherapy (EBRT), given daily for over a number of days and often weeks, or with TARGeted Intrabeam Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT), which is delivered, during surgery under the same anaesthetic. Several studies have reported the quantitative Quality-of-Life (QoL) benefits of TARGIT-IORT over EBRT. This qualitative study was designed to gather a deep understanding of the benefits and impacts of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT as perceived by patients. It also captured how differently the treatments affected the lived experience of the patient and their care partner through their treatment journey.

A patient-led Working Group was established to guide study design, delivery and to help validate findings. Patients with experience of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT were first purposively sampled by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after which a randomiser was applied to ensure the final selection process was free from bias. In February and March 2023, 29 semi-structured interviews (15 EBRT, 14 TARGIT-IORT) were conducted virtually via Zoom. Thematic analysis of verbatim interview transcripts was then carried out by two coders generating 11 themes related to either EBRT or TARGIT-IORT.

A number of procedural grievances were noted among EBRT patients. EBRT was perceived as being disruptive to a range of normal routines (work, home-life, and the burden of travel), and dissatisfying due to discomfort of side effects. TARGIT-IORT was perceived by patients and care partners as being efficient (given while they are asleep during surgery and without additional hospital visits) with minimal if any disruptions to QoL and that it was the safer option. The need for adequate, accessible information provision at the right time to reduce anxieties was noted in both cohorts. These new insights are valuable for healthcare staff and policy makers and could help incorporate the two treatments into routine practice. Further research is now needed to explore TARGIT-IORT in more diverse populations and in the 35 other countries where it is already a well- established treatment option.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been suggested as risk, prognostic, and predictive factors for colorectal cancer in various populations, but have not been validated so far. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) small nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of rectal cancer as well as the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) based on 5-Fluorouracil (5- FU)/leucovorin (LV) in the locally advanced setting.

Patients and methodsA total of 102 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 119 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) was used for MTHFR genotyping

ResultsUsing dominant and recessive models, it was found that the MTHFR 667C allele and the 1298A allele were significantly associated with rectal cancer as low-penetrant factors. Combined genotype analysis highlighted the protective role of the 677CT/1298AC genotype and increased risk for rectal cancer development for carriers of 677CC/1298AA. Haplotype analysis indicated that carriers of haplotype 677C/1298A have an increased risk for rectal cancer development while the haplotype 677T/1298A has a protective role. No significant association with response to chemoradiotherapy was found

ConclusionOur data point to MTHFR 667C allele and 1298A alleles as low-penetrant risk factors for rectal cancer in our population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this type performed on the Slavic population in the Western Balkan area which might be useful for future meta-analyses and the construction of genetic cancer risk prediction panels, as various population-based factors might also be significant in this setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tumor type guides clinical treatment decisions in cancer, but histology-based diagnosis remains challenging. Genomic alterations are highly diagnostic of tumor type, and tumor type classifiers trained on genomic features have been explored, but the most accurate methods are not clinically feasible, relying on features derived from whole genome sequencing (WGS), or predicting across limited cancer types. We use genomic features from a dataset of 39,787 solid tumors sequenced using a clinical targeted cancer gene panel to develop Genome-Derived-Diagnosis Ensemble (GDD-ENS): a hyperparameter ensemble for classifying tumor type using deep neural networks. GDD-ENS achieves 93% accuracy for high-confidence predictions across 38 cancer types, rivalling performance of WGS-based methods. GDD-ENS can also guide diagnoses on rare type and cancers of unknown primary, and incorporate patient-specific clinical information for improved predictions. Overall, integrating GDD-ENS into prospective clinical sequencing workflows has enabled clinically-relevant tumor type predictions to guide treatment decisions in real time.</p>
