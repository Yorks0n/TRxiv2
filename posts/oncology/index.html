T.; Zheng, X.; Madsen, G. I.; Mund, A.; Rosenberger, F. A.; Moreira, J. M. A.; Mann, M.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.25.23298987\nColorectal adenomas (CRA) are precursor lesions of the colon that may progress to adenocarcinomas, with patients currently categorized into risk groups by morphological features. We aimed to establish a molecular feature-based risk allocation framework towards improved patient stratification. Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) is a novel approach that combines image-based artificial intelligence with automated microdissection and ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry. Here we used DVP on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CRA tissues from nine patients, immunohistologically stained for Caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a protein implicated in colorectal cancer, enabling the characterization of cellular heterogeneity within distinct tissue regions and across patients. DVP seamlessly integrated with current pathology workflows and equipment, identifying DMBT1, MARCKS and CD99 as correlated with disease recurrence history, making them potential markers of risk stratification. DVP uncovered a metabolic switch towards anaerobic glycolysis in areas of high dysplasia, which was specific for cells with high CDX2 expression. Our findings underscore the potential of spatial proteomics to refine early-stage detection and contribute to personalized patient management strategies and provided novel insights into metabolic reprogramming.\nEvolutionary dynamics of 1,976 lymphoid malignancies predict clinical outcome\nAuthors: Gabbutt, C.; Duran-Ferrer, M.; Grant, H.; Mallo, D.; Nadeu, F.; Househam, J.; Villamor, N.; Krali, O.; Nordlund, J.; Zenz, T.; Campo, E.; Lopez-Guillermo, A.; Fitzgibbon, J.; Barnes, C. P.; Shibata, D.; Martin-Subero, J. I.; Graham, T. A.\nScore: 47.0, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298336\nCancer development, progression, and response to treatment are evolutionary processes, but characterising the evolutionary dynamics at sufficient scale to be clinically-meaningful has remained challenging. Here, we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based upon natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterised lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that tumour growth rates, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe that tumour growth rates are higher in more aggressive disease subtypes, and in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients, evolutionary histories are independent prognostic factors. Phylogenetic analyses of longitudinal CLL samples using EVOFLUx detect the seeds of future Richter transformation many decades prior to presentation. We provide orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences using additional genetic and clinical data. Collectively, we show how widely-available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measures cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.\nAn elevated rate of whole-genome duplication events in cancers from Black patients\nAuthors: Brown, L. M.; Hagenson, R. A.; Sheltzer, J. M.\nScore: 35.8, Published: 2023-11-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.10.23298349\nIn the United States, Black individuals have higher rates of cancer mortality than any other racial or ethnic group. The sources of these significant racial disparities are not fully understood, and may include social, environmental, and genetic factors that influence cancer onset, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we examined genomic data from several large-scale cancer patient cohorts to search for racial associations in chromosome copy number alterations. We found that tumors from Black patients were significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from white patients. Among patients with WGD-positive cancers, there was no significant difference in survival between Black and white patients, suggesting that the increased incidence of WGD events could contribute to the disparities in patient outcome. Genomic analysis identified several somatic alterations associated with WGD events that were consistent between Black and white populations, indicating that the increase in WGD events may be driven by environmental or epigenetic factors in Black patients. In total, these findings identify a class of genomic alterations that may influence racial disparities in cancer patient outcome. As cancers that have undergone WGD events exhibit unique genetic vulnerabilities, therapies that selectively target WGD-positive cancers may be particularly effective at treating aggressive malignancies in Black patients.\nVariability of mutational signatures is a footprint of carcinogens\nAuthors: Morrison, M. L.; Mange, L.; Senkin, S.; Rosenberg, N. A.; Foll, M.; Fernandez-Cuesta, L.; Alcala, N.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.23.23298821\nUnderstanding the genomic impact of carcinogens is fundamental to cancer biology and prevention. However, recent coordinated efforts to detect such fingerprints have been largely unsuccessful, challenging the paradigm that carcinogens induce identifiable mutational signatures. Here we introduce a new method based on statistics from population genetics, signature variability analysis (SVA), that elucidates both the diversity of tumorcausing processes and the heterogeneity of population carcinogen exposure. When we use SVA to re-analyze four prominent studies commonly cited as evidence of nonmutagenic carcinogens, we find that tumors induced by environmental carcinogens do possess mutational signature patterns that distinguish them from spontaneous tumors, even if a specific mutational signature cannot be detected. We find that, across cancers, organs, and model organisms, carcinogen exposure generally increases both the diversity of mutational signatures within a tumor and the homogeneity of signature activity across subjects. Importantly, we show that this increase in signature diversity, far from being a background effect, is associated with the geographic incidence of cancer and can facilitate the acquisition of cancer driver mutations. Our results both encourage a re-examination of the genomic impact of numerous substances and introduce new tools for the analysis of the genomic effects of other substances, potentially influencing carcinogen classifications and cancer prevention policies.\nValidation and Responsiveness of the English version of the Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia Distress Scale (CADS) in Breast Cancer Patients.\nAuthors: Kraehenbuehl, L.; Kang, D.; Bang, A. S.; Ketosugbo, K. F.; Hay, J.; Patil, S.; Goldfarb, S.; Cho, J.; Lacouture, M. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.05.23298093\nPurposeThis study aimed to validate the chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress scale (CADS) in a diverse English-speaking population and patients with endocrine treatment- induced alopecia (EIA). ObjectiveChemotherapy and endocrine therapy commonly cause alopecia in breast cancer patients, leading to significant psychological and social challenges. The CADS was developed to assess the psychosocial impact of alopecia, but its generalizability beyond Korean patients requires further investigation. MethodsData from the CHANCE study (NCT02530177), which focused on non-metastatic breast cancer, was used. The cohort included 256 patients, and CADS data were collected at baseline, six months after chemotherapy completion, or 12 months after initiating endocrine therapy. The CADS questionnaire comprised 17 items covering physical and emotional health, daily activities, and relationships. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha, and responsiveness was measured by effect size. ResultsThe CADS exhibited good reliability, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.91 for the overall score, indicating acceptable internal consistency in both chemotherapy (0.89) and endocrine therapy (0.86) groups. Longitudinal responsiveness was supported by an effect size of 0.49 between decreasing satisfaction with hair growth and increasing emotional distress. Cross-sectional validity was confirmed, with effect sizes of 0.91 and 0.92 for satisfaction with hair growth and emotional and activity domains, respectively. ConclusionThe CADS is a valid and responsive tool for assessing the psychosocial impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia and endocrine treatment-induced alopecia in a diverse Western patient population.\n",

        <p class="abstract">In the United States, Black individuals have higher rates of cancer mortality than any other racial or ethnic group. The sources of these significant racial disparities are not fully understood, and may include social, environmental, and genetic factors that influence cancer onset, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we examined genomic data from several large-scale cancer patient cohorts to search for racial associations in chromosome copy number alterations. We found that tumors from Black patients were significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from white patients. Among patients with WGD-positive cancers, there was no significant difference in survival between Black and white patients, suggesting that the increased incidence of WGD events could contribute to the disparities in patient outcome. Genomic analysis identified several somatic alterations associated with WGD events that were consistent between Black and white populations, indicating that the increase in WGD events may be driven by environmental or epigenetic factors in Black patients. In total, these findings identify a class of genomic alterations that may influence racial disparities in cancer patient outcome. As cancers that have undergone WGD events exhibit unique genetic vulnerabilities, therapies that selectively target WGD-positive cancers may be particularly effective at treating aggressive malignancies in Black patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the genomic impact of carcinogens is fundamental to cancer biology and prevention. However, recent coordinated efforts to detect such fingerprints have been largely unsuccessful, challenging the paradigm that carcinogens induce identifiable mutational signatures. Here we introduce a new method based on statistics from population genetics, signature variability analysis (SVA), that elucidates both the diversity of tumorcausing processes and the heterogeneity of population carcinogen exposure. When we use SVA to re-analyze four prominent studies commonly cited as evidence of nonmutagenic carcinogens, we find that tumors induced by environmental carcinogens do possess mutational signature patterns that distinguish them from spontaneous tumors, even if a specific mutational signature cannot be detected. We find that, across cancers, organs, and model organisms, carcinogen exposure generally increases both the diversity of mutational signatures within a tumor and the homogeneity of signature activity across subjects. Importantly, we show that this increase in signature diversity, far from being a background effect, is associated with the geographic incidence of cancer and can facilitate the acquisition of cancer driver mutations. Our results both encourage a re-examination of the genomic impact of numerous substances and introduce new tools for the analysis of the genomic effects of other substances, potentially influencing carcinogen classifications and cancer prevention policies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">PurposeThis study aimed to validate the chemotherapy-induced alopecia distress scale (CADS) in a diverse English-speaking population and patients with endocrine treatment- induced alopecia (EIA).

ObjectiveChemotherapy and endocrine therapy commonly cause alopecia in breast cancer patients, leading to significant psychological and social challenges. The CADS was developed to assess the psychosocial impact of alopecia, but its generalizability beyond Korean patients requires further investigation.

MethodsData from the CHANCE study (NCT02530177), which focused on non-metastatic breast cancer, was used. The cohort included 256 patients, and CADS data were collected at baseline, six months after chemotherapy completion, or 12 months after initiating endocrine therapy. The CADS questionnaire comprised 17 items covering physical and emotional health, daily activities, and relationships. Reliability was assessed using Cronbachs alpha, and responsiveness was measured by effect size.

ResultsThe CADS exhibited good reliability, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.91 for the overall score, indicating acceptable internal consistency in both chemotherapy (0.89) and endocrine therapy (0.86) groups. Longitudinal responsiveness was supported by an effect size of 0.49 between decreasing satisfaction with hair growth and increasing emotional distress. Cross-sectional validity was confirmed, with effect sizes of 0.91 and 0.92 for satisfaction with hair growth and emotional and activity domains, respectively.

ConclusionThe CADS is a valid and responsive tool for assessing the psychosocial impact of chemotherapy-induced alopecia and endocrine treatment-induced alopecia in a diverse Western patient population.</p>
