S.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-10-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.23297825\nBackgroundThe capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate human-readable text has prompted the investigation of their potential as educational and management tools for cancer patients and healthcare providers. Materials and MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study aimed at evaluating the ability of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Google Bard to answer questions related to four domains of immuno-oncology (Mechanisms, Indications, Toxicities, and Prognosis). We generated 60 open-ended questions (15 for each section). Questions were manually submitted to LLMs, and responses were collected on June 30th, 2023. Two reviewers evaluated the answers independently. ResultsChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 answered all questions, whereas Google Bard answered only 53.3% (p \u003c0.0001). The number of questions with reproducible answers was higher for ChatGPT-4 (95%) and ChatGPT3.5 (88.3%) than for Google Bard (50%) (p \u003c0.0001). In terms of accuracy, the number of answers deemed fully correct were 75.4%, 58.5%, and 43.8% for ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Google Bard, respectively (p = 0.03). Furthermore, the number of responses deemed highly relevant was 71.9%, 77.4%, and 43.8% for ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Google Bard, respectively (p = 0.04). Regarding readability, the number of highly readable was higher for ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 (98.1%) and (100%) compared to Google Bard (87.5%) (p = 0.02). ConclusionChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 are potentially powerful tools in immuno-oncology, whereas Google Bard demonstrated relatively poorer performance. However, the risk of inaccuracy or incompleteness in the responses was evident in all three LLMs, highlighting the importance of expert-driven verification of the outputs returned by these technologies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICESeveral studies have recently evaluated whether large language models may be feasible tools for providing educational and management information for cancer patients and healthcare providers. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the ability of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and Google Bard to answer questions related to immuno-oncology. ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 returned a higher proportion of responses, which were more accurate and comprehensive, than those returned by Google Bard, yielding highly reproducible and readable outputs. These data support ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 as powerful tools in providing information on immuno-oncology; however, accuracy remains a concern, with expert assessment of the output still indicated.\nNRF2-driven transcription and KEAPness predict survival outcomes in lung cancer treated with immunotherapy.\nAuthors: Scalera, S.; Ricciuti, B.; Marinelli, D.; Mazzotta, M.; Cipriani, L.; Bon, G.; Messina, B.; Schiavoni, G.; Di Federico, A.; Alessi, J.; Fanciulli, M.; Ciuffreda, L.; De Nicola, F.; Goeman, F.; Caravagna, G.; Santini, D.; De Maria, R.; Cappuzzo, F.; Ciliberto, G.; Jamal-Hanjani, M.; Awad, M.; McGranahan, N.; Maugeri-Sacca, M.\nScore: 3.2, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.23297743\nKEAP1 mutations have emerged as determinants of survival outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Given that mutational inactivation of KEAP1 leads to NRF2 transcription, we hypothesized that gene expression can determine immune responsiveness with higher precision. Using the TCGA, we identified a NRF2 gene signature shared by NSCLC with and without KEAP1-NRF2 pathway mutations. NRF2-enriched tumors were associated with poor survival outcomes and immune exclusion in two independent cohorts of ICI-treated NSCLC patients (SU2C n=153; OAK/POPLAR n=439). Patients with KEAPness (NRF2-enriched and KEAP1 wild-type) tumors had survival outcomes comparable to their KEAP1-mutant counterparts. In the TRACERx 421, NRF2-enriched tumors exhibited limited transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity and an immune-excluded microenvironment. Moreover, the comparison between KEAP1-mutant and KEAPness NSCLC revealed shared and private cancer genes under positive selection. This study demonstrates that NRF2 transcriptional activity and KEAP1-loss phenocopies predict immunotherapy outcomes and outperforms mutational models.\nA multidimensional analysis reveals distinct immune phenotypes and tertiary lymphoid structure-like aggregates in the bone marrow of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia\nAuthors: Koedijk, J. B.; van der Werf, I.; Penter, L.; Vermeulen, M. A.; Barneh, F.; Perzolli, A.; Meesters-Ensing, J. I.; Fiocco, M.; de Groot-Kruseman, H. A.; Moeniralam, R.; Bang Christensen, K.; Porter, B.; Pfaff, K.; Garcia, J. S.; Rodig, S. J.; Wu, C. J.; Hasle, H.; Nierkens, S.; Belderbos, M. E.; Zwaan, C. M.; Heidenreich, O.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-10-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.03.23286485\nBecause of the low mutational burden, children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are thought to have a cold tumor microenvironment and consequently, a low likelihood of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies. Here, we provide a multidimensional overview of the tumor immune microenvironment in newly diagnosed pediatric AML. On a cohort level, we demonstrate wide variation in T cell infiltration with nearly one-third of cases harboring an immune-infiltrated bone marrow. These immune-infiltrated cases are characterized by a decreased abundance of M2-like macrophages, which we find to be associated with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in adult AML. On an organizational level, we reveal the composition of spatially organized immune aggregates in pediatric AML, and show that in the adult setting such aggregates in post-treatment bone marrow and extramedullary sites associate with response to ipilimumab-based therapy. Altogether, our study provides immune correlates of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies and indicates starting points for further investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML. Statement of significanceThe limited response rates to T cell-directed immunotherapies remain a major challenge in AML. This study reveals the spatial organization of the tumor immune microenvironment in pediatric AML, identifies that immune aggregates associate with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in the adult setting, and provides starting points for future investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML.\n",

Using the TCGA, we identified a NRF2 gene signature shared by NSCLC with and without KEAP1-NRF2 pathway mutations. NRF2-enriched tumors were associated with poor survival outcomes and immune exclusion in two independent cohorts of ICI-treated NSCLC patients (SU2C n=153; OAK/POPLAR n=439). Patients with KEAPness (NRF2-enriched and KEAP1 wild-type) tumors had survival outcomes comparable to their KEAP1-mutant counterparts. In the TRACERx 421, NRF2-enriched tumors exhibited limited transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity and an immune-excluded microenvironment. Moreover, the comparison between KEAP1-mutant and KEAPness NSCLC revealed shared and private cancer genes under positive selection. This study demonstrates that NRF2 transcriptional activity and KEAP1-loss phenocopies predict immunotherapy outcomes and outperforms mutational models.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Because of the low mutational burden, children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are thought to have a  cold tumor microenvironment and consequently, a low likelihood of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies. Here, we provide a multidimensional overview of the tumor immune microenvironment in newly diagnosed pediatric AML. On a cohort level, we demonstrate wide variation in T cell infiltration with nearly one-third of cases harboring an immune-infiltrated bone marrow. These immune-infiltrated cases are characterized by a decreased abundance of M2-like macrophages, which we find to be associated with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in adult AML. On an organizational level, we reveal the composition of spatially organized immune aggregates in pediatric AML, and show that in the adult setting such aggregates in post-treatment bone marrow and extramedullary sites associate with response to ipilimumab-based therapy. Altogether, our study provides immune correlates of response to T cell-directed immunotherapies and indicates starting points for further investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML.

Statement of significanceThe limited response rates to T cell-directed immunotherapies remain a major challenge in AML. This study reveals the spatial organization of the tumor immune microenvironment in pediatric AML, identifies that immune aggregates associate with response to T cell-directed immunotherapy in the adult setting, and provides starting points for future investigations into immunomodulatory mechanisms in AML.</p>
