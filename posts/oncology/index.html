M.\nScore: 2.0, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.24301220\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest cancers due in part to the cancer being diagnosed is at a late stage when effective treatment options are limited. Early detection of PDAC via liquid biopsy would revolutionize survival from the disease. To address the lack of effective non-invasive detection assays for PDAC, we developed a protease activity-based assay using a magnetic nanosensor (PAC*MANN). The PAC*MANN assay leverages protease activity in blood to amplify the signal of the target-probe based sensor. An initial screening revealed that the PAC*MANN assay could reliably differentiate patients with PDAC from healthy subjects and patients at high risk of PDAC. Finally, in two cohorts: training (n=145) and blinded validation (n=72), we demonstrated that the PAC*MANN assay had high specificity (86%) and sensitivity (78%) for detection of PDAC compared to healthy subjects. This performance was enhanced when combined with the current standard of care assay, CA19-9 (100% specificity, 84% sensitivity). Our results demonstrate a novel assay that is rapid, high-throughput, and requires low specimen volume, which may not only improve cancer detection but could be useful for monitoring of at-risk patients and could be deployed in low resource settings.

A.; Oh, Y. J.; Lee, J.; Yu, J.; Chung, L. I.-Y.; Lee, Y.; Kim, L.; Hong, T.; Lee, S.; Shah, Z.; Park, J. H.; Yoon, S. M.; Chae, Y. K.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.23300116\nIntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may be associated with hyperprogressive disease (HPD). However, there is currently no standardized definition of HPD, with its risk factors and clinical implications remaining unclear. We investigated HPD in lung cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, aiming to redefine HPD, identify risk factors, and assess its impact on survival. MethodsClinical and radiologic data from 121 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with 136 immunotherapy cases were reviewed retrospectively. Three HPD definitions (Champiat et al., HPDc; Saada-Bouzid et al., HPDs; and Ferrara et al., HPDf) were employed. Additionally, all new measurable lesions on the post-treatment CT scan were incorporated in measuring the sum of longest diameters (SLD) to define modified HPD (mHPD). ResultsAmong the 121 patients, 4 (3.3%) had HPDc, 11 (9.1%) had HPDs, and none had HPDf. Adding all new measurable lesions increased HPD incidence by 5%-10% across definitions. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with HPDc (HR 5.25, p=0.001; HR 3.75, p=0.015) and HPDs (HR 3.74, p\u003c0.001; HR 3.46, p\u003c0.001) compared to those without. Patients with mHPD showed similarly poor survival outcomes as HPD patients. Liver metastasis at diagnosis was associated with HPDs, and a high tumor burden correlated with HPDc. ConclusionsThe incidence and risk factors of HPD varied with different definitions, but mHPD identified more cases with poor outcomes. This comprehensive approach may enhance the identification of at-risk patients and lead to a better understanding of HPD in lung cancer during immunotherapy.\n",

Additionally, all new measurable lesions on the post-treatment CT scan were incorporated in measuring the sum of longest diameters (SLD) to define modified HPD (mHPD).

ResultsAmong the 121 patients, 4 (3.3%) had HPDc, 11 (9.1%) had HPDs, and none had HPDf. Adding all new measurable lesions increased HPD incidence by 5%-10% across definitions. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with HPDc (HR 5.25, p=0.001; HR 3.75, p=0.015) and HPDs (HR 3.74, p&lt;0.001; HR 3.46, p&lt;0.001) compared to those without. Patients with mHPD showed similarly poor survival outcomes as HPD patients. Liver metastasis at diagnosis was associated with HPDs, and a high tumor burden correlated with HPDc.

ConclusionsThe incidence and risk factors of HPD varied with different definitions, but mHPD identified more cases with poor outcomes. This comprehensive approach may enhance the identification of at-risk patients and lead to a better understanding of HPD in lung cancer during immunotherapy.</p>
