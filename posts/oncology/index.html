G.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295538\nBackgroundTreatment decision-making in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) includes clinical stage, HPV status, and smoking history. Despite improvements in staging with separation of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC in AJCC 8th edition (AJCC8), patients are largely treated with a uniform approach, with recent efforts focused on de-intensification in low-risk patients. We have previously shown, in a pooled analysis, that the genomic adjusted radiation dose (GARD) is predictive of radiation treatment benefit and can be used to guide RT dose selection. We hypothesize that GARD can be used to predict overall survival (OS) in HPV-positive OPSCC patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). MethodsGene expression profiles (Affymetrix Clariom D) were analyzed for 234 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from HPV-positive OPSCC patients within an international, multi-institutional, prospective/retrospective observational study including patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVb. GARD, a measure of the treatment effect of RT, was calculated for each patient as previously described. In total, 191 patients received primary RT definitive treatment (chemoradiation or RT alone, and 43 patients received post-operative RT. Two RT dose fractionations were utilized for primary RT cases (70 Gy in 35 fractions or 69.96 Gy in 33 fractions). Median RT dose was 70 Gy (range 50.88-74) for primary RT definitive cases and 66 Gy (range 44-70) for post-operative RT cases. The median follow up was 46.2 months (95% CI, 33.5-63.1). Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed with GARD as both a continuous and dichotomous variable and time-dependent ROC analyses compared the performance of GARD with the NRG clinical nomogram for overall survival. ResultsDespite uniform radiation dose utilization, GARD showed significant heterogeneity (range 30-110), reflecting the underlying genomic differences in the cohort. On multivariable analysis, each unit increase in GARD was associated with an improvement in OS (HR = 0.951 (0.911, 0.993), p = 0.023) compared to AJCC8 (HR = 1.999 (0.791, 5.047)), p = 0.143). ROC analysis for GARD at 36 months yielded an AUC of 80. 6 (69.4, 91.9) compared with an AUC of 73.6 (55.4, 91.7) for the NRG clinical nomogram. GARD[\u0026ge;] 64.2 was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.280 (0.100, 0.781), p = 0.015). In a virtual trial, GARD predicts that uniform RT dose de-escalation results in overall inferior OS but proposes two separate genomic strategies where selective RT dose de-escalation in GARD-selected populations results in clinical equipoise. ConclusionsIn this multi-institutional cohort of patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, GARD predicts OS as a continuous variable, outperforms the NRG nomogram and provides a novel genomic strategy to modern clinical trial design. We propose that GARD, which provides the first opportunity for genomic guided personalization of radiation dose, should be incorporated in the diagnostic workup of HPV-positive OPSCC patients.\nSpatial mapping of the hepatocellular carcinoma landscape identifies unique intratumoural perivascular-immune neighbourhoods\nAuthors: Marsh-Wakefield, F.; Santhakumar, C.; Ferguson, A. L.; Ashhurst, T. M.; Shin, J.-S.; Guan, F. H. X.; Shields, N. J.; Platt, B. J.; Gupta, R.; Crawford, M.; Pulitano, C.; Sandroussi, C.; Laurence, J. M.; Liu, K.; McCaughan, G. W.; Palendira, U.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.23295451\nBackground \u0026 AimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in the context of chronic inflammation, however, the opposing roles the immune system plays in both the development and control of tumours is not fully understood. Mapping immune cell interactions across the distinct tissue regions could provide greater insight into the role individual immune populations have within tumours. Approach \u0026 ResultsUsing highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry, we have mapped the immune landscape of tumour, invasive margin, and adjacent non-tumour regions across sixteen resected tumours comprising of 144 regions of interest and over 10,000 parameters. We show immune cell densities remain largely consistent across these three regions, except for subsets of monocyte-derived macrophages which are enriched within the tumours. Mapping cellular interactions across these regions in an unbiased manner identifies immune neighbourhoods comprised of tissue-resident T cells, dendritic cells, and various macrophage populations around perivascular spaces. Importantly, we identify multiple immune cells within these neighbourhoods interacting with VEGF+ perivascular macrophages. ConclusionsCellular interactions, but not cell densities, differ between intratumoural and adjacent non-tumour regions in HCC. Unique intratumoural immune neighbourhoods around the perivascular space points to an altered landscape within tumours. Enrichment of VEGF+ perivascular macrophages within these tumours could play a key role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability.\nDevelopment of a Neoadjuvant Treatment Pathway to Standardize Pancreatic Cancer Care and Improve Outcomes Across a Large Diverse Health System\nAuthors: Parakrama, R.; Sidiqi, B. U.; Demyan, L.; Standring, O.; Cooper, D. J.; Pasha, S.; Pinto, D. M.; Zavadsky, T.; Zou, X.; Patruni, S.; Kapusta, A.; Nosrati, J. D.; Tchelebi, L.; Weiss, M. J.; Herman, J. M.; King, D.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295749\nBackground: Management of localized pancreatic cancer is variable. We describe the development of a neoadjuvant therapy pathway (NATP) to standardize care across a large healthcare system. Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective analysis of NATP patients between June 2019 and March 2022. The primary endpoint was NATP completion, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and quality measures. Results: Fifty-nine patients began NATP, median age 70, locally advanced 44.1%. Median time on NATP was 6.1 months. The initial chemotherapy was FOLFIRINOX (64.2%) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP; (35.6%)) followed by radiation in 32 (54.2%) patients. Forty-four (74.6%) completed the NATP and 30 (50.8%) underwent surgical exploration with 86.7% undergoing successful resection (61.5% R0, 23.1% R1) while 14 remained unresectable. NATP completion was associated with increased likelihood of resection (p\u003c0.001). At median follow-up of 13.4 months, median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 13.3-28.5) and 1- and 2-year OS was 82.5% and 49.7%. NATP completion resulted in improved OS with median OS not reached and 1- and 2-year OS of 89.7% and 59.4% (p=0.004). Median time to NATP start was 20 days after MDR and median time to surgery was 35 days. Age, ECOG, surgical stage, chemotherapy regimen and NATP completion were significant univariable predictors of OS with ECOG status remaining significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion: Our outcomes provide a baseline for future guidance in improving care across a large system. Efforts to complete NATP and improve patient ECOG may result in more patients undergoing surgery and improve survival.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background &amp; AimsHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in the context of chronic inflammation, however, the opposing roles the immune system plays in both the development and control of tumours is not fully understood. Mapping immune cell interactions across the distinct tissue regions could provide greater insight into the role individual immune populations have within tumours.

Approach &amp; ResultsUsing highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry, we have mapped the immune landscape of tumour, invasive margin, and adjacent non-tumour regions across sixteen resected tumours comprising of 144 regions of interest and over 10,000 parameters. We show immune cell densities remain largely consistent across these three regions, except for subsets of monocyte-derived macrophages which are enriched within the tumours. Mapping cellular interactions across these regions in an unbiased manner identifies immune neighbourhoods comprised of tissue-resident T cells, dendritic cells, and various macrophage populations around perivascular spaces. Importantly, we identify multiple immune cells within these neighbourhoods interacting with VEGF&#43; perivascular macrophages.

ConclusionsCellular interactions, but not cell densities, differ between intratumoural and adjacent non-tumour regions in HCC. Unique intratumoural immune neighbourhoods around the perivascular space points to an altered landscape within tumours. Enrichment of VEGF&#43; perivascular macrophages within these tumours could play a key role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Management of localized pancreatic cancer is variable. We describe the development of a neoadjuvant therapy pathway (NATP) to standardize care across a large healthcare system. Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective analysis of NATP patients between June 2019 and March 2022. The primary endpoint was NATP completion, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and quality measures. Results: Fifty-nine patients began NATP, median age 70, locally advanced 44.1%. Median time on NATP was 6.1 months. The initial chemotherapy was FOLFIRINOX (64.2%) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP; (35.6%)) followed by radiation in 32 (54.2%) patients. Forty-four (74.6%) completed the NATP and 30 (50.8%) underwent surgical exploration with 86.7% undergoing successful resection (61.5% R0, 23.1% R1) while 14 remained unresectable. NATP completion was associated with increased likelihood of resection (p&lt;0.001). At median follow-up of 13.4 months, median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 13.3-28.5) and 1- and 2-year OS was 82.5% and 49.7%. NATP completion resulted in improved OS with median OS not reached and 1- and 2-year OS of 89.7% and 59.4% (p=0.004). Median time to NATP start was 20 days after MDR and median time to surgery was 35 days. Age, ECOG, surgical stage, chemotherapy regimen and NATP completion were significant univariable predictors of OS with ECOG status remaining significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion: Our outcomes provide a baseline for future guidance in improving care across a large system. Efforts to complete NATP and improve patient ECOG may result in more patients undergoing surgery and improve survival.</p>
