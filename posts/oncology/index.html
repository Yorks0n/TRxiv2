  "articleBody": " The tumor multi-omic landscape of endometrial cancers developed on a germline genetic background of adiposity\nAuthors: Richenberg, G.; Francis, A.; Owen, C. N.; Gray, V.; Robinson, T.; Gabriel, A. A. G.; Lawrenson, K.; Crosbie, E. J.; Schildkraut, J. M.; Mckay, J. D.; Gaunt, T. R.; Relton, C. L.; Vincent, E. E.; Kar, S. P.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.09.23296765\nHigh body mass index (BMI) is a causal risk factor for endometrial cancer but the tumor molecular mechanisms affected by adiposity and their therapeutic relevance remain poorly understood. Here we characterize the tumor multi-omic landscape of endometrial cancers that have developed on a background of lifelong germline genetic exposure to elevated BMI. We built a polygenic score (PGS) for BMI in women using data on independent, genome-wide significant variants associated with adult BMI in 434,794 women. We performed germline (blood) genotype quality control and imputation on data from 354 endometrial cancer cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We assigned each case in this TCGA cohort their genetically predicted life-course BMI based on the BMI PGS. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusted for age, stage, microsatellite status and genetic principal components were used to test for associations between the BMI germline PGS and endometrial cancer tumor genome-wide genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic and immune traits in TCGA. High BMI germline PGS was associated with (i) upregulated tumor gene expression in the IL6-JAK-STAT3 pathway (FDR=4.2x10-7); (ii) increased estimated intra-tumor activated mast cell infiltration (FDR=0.008); (iii) increased single base substitution (SBS) mutational signatures 1 (FDR=0.03) and 5 (FDR=0.09) and decreased SBS13 (FDR=0.09), implicating age-related and APOBEC mutagenesis, respectively; and (iv) decreased tumor EGFR protein expression (FDR=0.07). Alterations in IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling gene and EGFR protein expression were, in turn, significantly associated with both overall survival and progression-free interval. Thus, we integrated germline and somatic data using a novel study design to identify associations between genetically predicted lifelong exposure to higher BMI and potentially actionable endometrial cancer tumor molecular features. These associations inform our understanding of how high BMI may influence the development and progression of this cancer, impacting endometrial tumor biology and clinical outcomes.\nPrediction of individual survival and trial outcome for anti-PDL1 treatment in non-small cell lung cancer using blood markers-based kinetics-machine learning\nAuthors: Benzekry, S.; Karslsen, M.; Bigarre, C.; El Kaoutari, A.; Gomes, B.; Stern, M.; Neubert, A.; Bruno, R.; Mercier, F.; Vatakuti, S.; Curle, P.; Jamois, C.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-09-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.26.23296135\nCurrent predictive models for survival following immune-checkpoint inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer typically use baseline or tumor kinetics data. We propose a novel kinetics-machine learning (kML) integrative model of overall survival following anti-PDL1 treatment. It incorporates eleven baseline markers and four on-treatment blood markers: albumin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophils. The kinetics of the latter were modeled using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. The kML model was developed on three phase 2 trials (862 patients) and validated on a phase 3 trial (553 patients). It outperforms the current state-of-the-art for individual predictions with a test set c-index of 0.79, a 12-months AUC of 0.86 and a hazard ratio of 17.3 (95% CI: 8.11-36.7, p \u003c 0.0001) for identification of long-term survivors. kML was also able to anticipate the success of the phase 3 trial by utilizing only 25 weeks of on-study data. It constitutes a valuable approach to support personalized medicine and drug development.\nPerioperative outcomes and platinum resistant recurrence in patients undergoing protocol based total parietal peritonectomy during interval cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancer- results of the TORPEDO study\nAuthors: BHATT, A.; Sinukumar, S.; Damodaran, D.; Patel, A.; Shaikh, S.; Parikh, L.; Goswami, G.; Singh, A.; Kammar, P.; Mehta, S.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.08.23296709\nBackground and aimThe TORPEDO (CTRI/2018/12/016789) is the single-arm, prospective, interventional study evaluating the role of a total parietal peritonectomy (TPP) in patients undergoing interval cytoreductive surgery (iCRS). In this manuscript, we report the perioperative outcomes and platinum resistant recurrence (PRR) in 218 patients enrolled in the study. MethodsA TPP was performed in all patients undergoing iCRS irrespective of the residual disease extent. HIPEC was performed as per the clinicians discretion with 75mg/m2 of Cisplatin. Maintenance therapy was also used at the discretion of the treating clinicians. ResultsFrom 9th December 2018 to 31st July 2022 (recruitment complete), 218 patients were enrolled at 4 Indian centres. The median surgical PCI was 14 and a complete gross resection was achieved in 95.8%. HIPEC was performed in 130 (59.6%) patients. The 90-day major morbidity was 17.4% and 2.7% patients died within 90 days of surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed beyond 6 weeks in 7.3%. At a median follow-up of 19m [95% CI 15-35m], 101 (46.3%) recurrences and 19 (8.7%) deaths had occurred. The median PFS was 22m [95% CI 17-35m] and the median OS not reached. Platinum resistant recurrence was observed in 6.4%. The projected 3-year OS was 81.5% and in 80 patients treated before may 2020, it was 77.5%. ConclusionsThe morbidity and mortality of TPP with or without HIPEC performed during iCRS is acceptable. The incidence was of PRR is low. Early survival results are encouraging and warrant conduction of a randomized controlled trial comparing TPP with conventional surgery.\nDecoding pan-cancer treatment outcomes using multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence\nAuthors: Keyl, J.; Keyl, P.; Montavon, G.; Hosch, R.; Brehmer, A.; Mochmann, L.; Jurmeister, P.; Dernbach, G.; Kim, M.; Koitka, S.; Bauer, S.; Bechrakis, N.; Forsting, M.; Fuehrer-Sakel, D.; Glas, M.; Gruenwald, V.; Hadaschik, B.; Haubold, J.; Herrmann, K.; Kasper, S.; Kimmig, R.; Rassaf, T.; Roesch, A.; Schadendorf, D.; Siveke, J. T.; Stuschke, M.; Sure, U.; Totzeck, M.; Welt, A.; Wiesweg, M.; Baba, H. A.; Nensa, F.; Egger, J.; Mueller, K.-R.; Schuler, M.; Klauschen, F.; Kleesiek, J.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.12.23296873\nDespite advances in precision oncology, clinical decision-making still relies on limited parameters and expert knowledge. To address this limitation, we combined multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) to introduce novel AI-derived (AID) markers for clinical decision support. We used deep learning to model the outcome of 15,726 patients across 38 solid cancer entities based on 350 markers, including clinical records, image-derived body compositions, and mutational tumor profiles. xAI determined the prognostic contribution of each clinical marker at the patient level and identified 114 key markers that accounted for 90% of the neural network's decision process. Moreover, xAI enabled us to uncover 1,373 prognostic interactions between markers. Our approach was validated in an independent cohort of 3,288 lung cancer patients from a US nationwide electronic health record-derived database. These results show the potential of xAI to transform the assessment of clinical parameters and enable personalized, data-driven cancer care.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Current predictive models for survival following immune-checkpoint inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer typically use baseline or tumor kinetics data. We propose a novel kinetics-machine learning (kML) integrative model of overall survival following anti-PDL1 treatment. It incorporates eleven baseline markers and four on-treatment blood markers: albumin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophils. The kinetics of the latter were modeled using nonlinear mixed effect modeling. The kML model was developed on three phase 2 trials (862 patients) and validated on a phase 3 trial (553 patients). It outperforms the current state-of-the-art for individual predictions with a test set c-index of 0.79, a 12-months AUC of 0.86 and a hazard ratio of 17.3 (95% CI: 8.11-36.7, p &lt; 0.0001) for identification of long-term survivors. kML was also able to anticipate the success of the phase 3 trial by utilizing only 25 weeks of on-study data. It constitutes a valuable approach to support personalized medicine and drug development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background and aimThe TORPEDO (CTRI/2018/12/016789) is the single-arm, prospective, interventional study evaluating the role of a total parietal peritonectomy (TPP) in patients undergoing interval cytoreductive surgery (iCRS). In this manuscript, we report the perioperative outcomes and platinum resistant recurrence (PRR) in 218 patients enrolled in the study.

MethodsA TPP was performed in all patients undergoing iCRS irrespective of the residual disease extent. HIPEC was performed as per the clinicians discretion with 75mg/m2 of Cisplatin. Maintenance therapy was also used at the discretion of the treating clinicians.

ResultsFrom 9th December 2018 to 31st July 2022 (recruitment complete), 218 patients were enrolled at 4 Indian centres. The median surgical PCI was 14 and a complete gross resection was achieved in 95.8%. HIPEC was performed in 130 (59.6%) patients. The 90-day major morbidity was 17.4% and 2.7% patients died within 90 days of surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed beyond 6 weeks in 7.3%. At a median follow-up of 19m [95% CI 15-35m], 101 (46.3%) recurrences and 19 (8.7%) deaths had occurred. The median PFS was 22m [95% CI 17-35m] and the median OS not reached. Platinum resistant recurrence was observed in 6.4%. The projected 3-year OS was 81.5% and in 80 patients treated before may 2020, it was 77.5%.

ConclusionsThe morbidity and mortality of TPP with or without HIPEC performed during iCRS is acceptable. The incidence was of PRR is low. Early survival results are encouraging and warrant conduction of a randomized controlled trial comparing TPP with conventional surgery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite advances in precision oncology, clinical decision-making still relies on limited parameters and expert knowledge. To address this limitation, we combined multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) to introduce novel AI-derived (AID) markers for clinical decision support. We used deep learning to model the outcome of 15,726 patients across 38 solid cancer entities based on 350 markers, including clinical records, image-derived body compositions, and mutational tumor profiles. xAI determined the prognostic contribution of each clinical marker at the patient level and identified 114 key markers that accounted for 90% of the neural network&#39;s decision process. Moreover, xAI enabled us to uncover 1,373 prognostic interactions between markers. Our approach was validated in an independent cohort of 3,288 lung cancer patients from a US nationwide electronic health record-derived database. These results show the potential of xAI to transform the assessment of clinical parameters and enable personalized, data-driven cancer care.</p>
