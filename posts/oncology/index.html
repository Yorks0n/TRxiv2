Despite established guidelines, patient education prior to TGT is variable or frequently omitted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a concise (3-4 minute) video for patient education prior to TGT. MethodsBased on a quality improvement cycle, an animated video was created to be applicable to any cancer type, incorporating culturally diverse images, available in English and Spanish. Patients undergoing standard-of care TGT were enrolled at a tertiary academic institution and completed validated survey instruments immediately prior to video viewing (T1) and immediately post-viewing (T2). Instruments included: 1) 10-question objective genomic knowledge/understanding; 2) 10-question video message-specific knowledge/recall; 3) 11-question Trust in Physician/Provider; 4) attitudes regarding TGT. The primary objective was change in outcomes from before to after the video was assessed with Wilcoxon signed rank test. ResultsFrom April 2022 to May 2023, a total of 150 participants were enrolled (MBC n=53, LC n=38, OC n=59). For the primary endpoint, there was a significant increase in video message-specific knowledge (median 10 point increase; p\u003c0.0001) with no significant change in genomic knowledge/understanding (p=0.89) or Trust in Physician/Provider (p=0.59). Results for five questions significantly improved, including the likelihood of TGT impact on treatment decision, incidental germline findings, and cost of testing. Improvement in video message-specific knowledge was consistent across demographic groups, including age, income, and education. Individuals with less educational attainment had had greater improvement from before to after video viewing. ConclusionsA concise, 3-4 minute, broadly applicable video incorporating culturally diverse images administered prior to TGT significantly improved video message-specific knowledge across all demographic groups. This resource is publicly available at http://www.tumor-testing.com, with a goal to efficiently educate and empower patients regarding TGT while addressing guidelines within the flow of clinical practice. Clinical Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT05215769\nMolecular landscapes of oral cancers of unknown etiology\nAuthors: Deneuve, S.; Fervers, B.; Senkin, S.; Bouaoun, L.; Perol, O.; Chavanel, B.; Lu, L.; Coste, I.; Renno, T.; Zavadil, J.; Virard, F.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.23299866\nThe incidence of the mobile tongue cancer in young patients has been rising. This oral cancer (OC) type has no identified risk factors (NIRF), no established molecular markers and is not yet recognized as a distinct clinical entity. To understand this emerging malignancy, we innovatively analyzed the public head and neck cancer multi-omics data. We identified mutational signatures that successfully stratified 307 OC and 109 laryngeal cancer cases according to their clinico-pathological characteristics. The NIRF OCs exhibited significantly increased activities of endogenous clock-like and APOBEC- associated mutagenesis, alongside specific cancer driver gene mutations, distinct methylome patterns and prominent antimicrobial transcriptomic responses. Furthermore, we show that mutational signature SBS16 in OCs reflects the combined effects of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking. Our study characterizes the unique disease histories and molecular programs of the NIRF OCs revealing that this emerging cancer subtype is likely driven by increased endogenous mutagenesis correlated with responses to microbial insults.\nAssociation of ESR1 germline variants with TP53 somatic variants in breast tumors in a genome-wide study\nAuthors: Tjader, N. P.; Beer, A. J.; Ramroop, J.; Tai, M.-C.; Ping, J.; Gandhi, T.; Dauch, C.; Neuhausen, S. L.; Ziv, E.; Sotelo, N.; Ghanekar, S.; Meadows, O.; Paredes, M.; Gillespie, J.; Aeilts, A.; Hampel, H.; Zheng, W.; Jia, G.; Hu, Q.; Wei, L.; Liu, S.; Ambrosone, C. B.; Palmer, J. R.; Carpten, J. D.; Yao, S.; Stevens, P.; Ho, W.-K.; Pan, J. W.; Fadda, P.; Huo, D.; Teo, S.-H.; McElroy, J. P.; Toland, A. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299442\nBackgroundIn breast tumors, somatic mutation frequencies in TP53 and PIK3CA vary by tumor subtype and ancestry. HER2 positive and triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have a higher frequency of TP53 somatic mutations than other subtypes. PIK3CA mutations are more frequently observed in hormone receptor positive tumors. Emerging data suggest tumor mutation status is associated with germline variants and genetic ancestry. We aimed to identify germline variants that are associated with somatic TP53 or PIK3CA mutation status in breast tumors. MethodsA genome-wide association study was conducted using breast cancer mutation status of TP53 and PIK3CA and functional mutation categories including TP53 gain of function (GOF) and loss of function mutations and PIK3CA activating/hotspot mutations. The discovery analysis consisted of 2850 European ancestry women from three datasets. Germline variants showing evidence of association with somatic mutations were selected for validation analyses based on predicted function, allele frequency, and proximity to known cancer genes or risk loci. Candidate variants were assessed for association with mutation status in a multi-ancestry validation study, a Malaysian study, and a study of African American/Black women with TNBC. ResultsThe discovery Germline x Mutation (GxM) association study found five variants associated with one or more TP53 phenotypes with P values \u003c1x10-6, 33 variants associated with one or more TP53 phenotypes with P values \u003c1x10-5, and 44 variants associated with one or more PIK3CA phenotypes with P values \u003c1x10-5. In the multi-ancestry and Malaysian validation studies, germline ESR1 locus variant, rs9383938, was associated with the presence of TP53 mutations overall (P values 6.8x10-5 and 9.8x10-8, respectively) and TP53 GOF mutations (P value 8.4x10-6). Multiple variants showed suggestive evidence of association with PIK3CA mutation status in the validation studies, but none were significant after correction for multiple comparisons. ConclusionsWe found evidence that germline variants were associated with TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status in breast cancers. Variants near the estrogen receptor alpha gene, ESR1, were significantly associated with overall TP53 mutations and GOF mutations. Larger multi-ancestry studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine if these variants contribute to ancestry-specific differences in mutation frequency.\nAdjuvant nivolumab, capecitabine or the combination in patients with residual triple-negative breast cancer: the OXEL randomized phase II study\nAuthors: Lynce, F.; Mainor, C.; Donahue, R. N.; Geng, X.; Jones, G.; Schlam, I.; Wang, H.; Toney, N. J.; Jochems, C.; Schlom, J.; Zeck, J.; Gallagher, C.; Nanda, R.; Graham, D.; Stringer-Reasor, E. M.; Denduluri, N.; Collins, J.; Chitalia, A.; Tiwari, S.; Nunes, R.; Kaltman, R.; Khoury, K.; Gatti-Mays, M.; Tarantino, P.; Tolaney, S. M.; Swain, S. M.; Pohlmann, P.; Parsons, H. A.; Isaacs, C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.04.23297559\nChemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors have a role in the post-neoadjuvant setting in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the effects of nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, capecitabine, or the combination in changing peripheral immunoscore (PIS) remains unclear. This open-label randomized phase II OXEL study (NCT03487666) aimed to assess the immunologic effects of nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination in terms of the change in PIS (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints include the presence of ctDNA, toxicity, clinical outcomes at 2-years and association of ctDNA and PIS with clinical outcomes. Forty-five women with TNBC and residual invasive disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination. Here we show that a combination of nivolumab plus capecitabine leads to a greater increase in PIS from baseline to week 6 (91%) compared with nivolumab (47%) or capecitabine (53%) alone (log-rank p = 0.08), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. In addition, the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was associated with disease recurrence, with no new safety signals in the combination arm. Our results provide efficacy and safety data on this combination in TNBC and support further development of PIS and ctDNA analyses to identify patients at high risk of recurrence.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The incidence of the mobile tongue cancer in young patients has been rising. This oral cancer (OC) type has no identified risk factors (NIRF), no established molecular markers and is not yet recognized as a distinct clinical entity. To understand this emerging malignancy, we innovatively analyzed the public head and neck cancer multi-omics data. We identified mutational signatures that successfully stratified 307 OC and 109 laryngeal cancer cases according to their clinico-pathological characteristics. The NIRF OCs exhibited significantly increased activities of endogenous clock-like and APOBEC- associated mutagenesis, alongside specific cancer driver gene mutations, distinct methylome patterns and prominent antimicrobial transcriptomic responses. Furthermore, we show that mutational signature SBS16 in OCs reflects the combined effects of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking. Our study characterizes the unique disease histories and molecular programs of the NIRF OCs revealing that this emerging cancer subtype is likely driven by increased endogenous mutagenesis correlated with responses to microbial insults.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn breast tumors, somatic mutation frequencies in TP53 and PIK3CA vary by tumor subtype and ancestry. HER2 positive and triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have a higher frequency of TP53 somatic mutations than other subtypes. PIK3CA mutations are more frequently observed in hormone receptor positive tumors. Emerging data suggest tumor mutation status is associated with germline variants and genetic ancestry. We aimed to identify germline variants that are associated with somatic TP53 or PIK3CA mutation status in breast tumors.

MethodsA genome-wide association study was conducted using breast cancer mutation status of TP53 and PIK3CA and functional mutation categories including TP53 gain of function (GOF) and loss of function mutations and PIK3CA activating/hotspot mutations. The discovery analysis consisted of 2850 European ancestry women from three datasets. Germline variants showing evidence of association with somatic mutations were selected for validation analyses based on predicted function, allele frequency, and proximity to known cancer genes or risk loci. Candidate variants were assessed for association with mutation status in a multi-ancestry validation study, a Malaysian study, and a study of African American/Black women with TNBC.

ResultsThe discovery Germline x Mutation (GxM) association study found five variants associated with one or more TP53 phenotypes with P values &lt;1x10-6, 33 variants associated with one or more TP53 phenotypes with P values &lt;1x10-5, and 44 variants associated with one or more PIK3CA phenotypes with P values &lt;1x10-5. In the multi-ancestry and Malaysian validation studies, germline ESR1 locus variant, rs9383938, was associated with the presence of TP53 mutations overall (P values 6.8x10-5 and 9.8x10-8, respectively) and TP53 GOF mutations (P value 8.4x10-6). Multiple variants showed suggestive evidence of association with PIK3CA mutation status in the validation studies, but none were significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

ConclusionsWe found evidence that germline variants were associated with TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status in breast cancers. Variants near the estrogen receptor alpha gene, ESR1, were significantly associated with overall TP53 mutations and GOF mutations. Larger multi-ancestry studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine if these variants contribute to ancestry-specific differences in mutation frequency.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors have a role in the post-neoadjuvant setting in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the effects of nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, capecitabine, or the combination in changing peripheral immunoscore (PIS) remains unclear. This open-label randomized phase II OXEL study (NCT03487666) aimed to assess the immunologic effects of nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination in terms of the change in PIS (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints include the presence of ctDNA, toxicity, clinical outcomes at 2-years and association of ctDNA and PIS with clinical outcomes. Forty-five women with TNBC and residual invasive disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination. Here we show that a combination of nivolumab plus capecitabine leads to a greater increase in PIS from baseline to week 6 (91%) compared with nivolumab (47%) or capecitabine (53%) alone (log-rank p = 0.08), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. In addition, the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was associated with disease recurrence, with no new safety signals in the combination arm. Our results provide efficacy and safety data on this combination in TNBC and support further development of PIS and ctDNA analyses to identify patients at high risk of recurrence.</p>
