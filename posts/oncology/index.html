G.\nScore: 20.3, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295538\nBackgroundTreatment decision-making in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) includes clinical stage, HPV status, and smoking history. Despite improvements in staging with separation of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC in AJCC 8th edition (AJCC8), patients are largely treated with a uniform approach, with recent efforts focused on de-intensification in low-risk patients. We have previously shown, in a pooled analysis, that the genomic adjusted radiation dose (GARD) is predictive of radiation treatment benefit and can be used to guide RT dose selection. We hypothesize that GARD can be used to predict overall survival (OS) in HPV-positive OPSCC patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). MethodsGene expression profiles (Affymetrix Clariom D) were analyzed for 234 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from HPV-positive OPSCC patients within an international, multi-institutional, prospective/retrospective observational study including patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVb. GARD, a measure of the treatment effect of RT, was calculated for each patient as previously described. In total, 191 patients received primary RT definitive treatment (chemoradiation or RT alone, and 43 patients received post-operative RT. Two RT dose fractionations were utilized for primary RT cases (70 Gy in 35 fractions or 69.96 Gy in 33 fractions). Median RT dose was 70 Gy (range 50.88-74) for primary RT definitive cases and 66 Gy (range 44-70) for post-operative RT cases. The median follow up was 46.2 months (95% CI, 33.5-63.1). Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed with GARD as both a continuous and dichotomous variable and time-dependent ROC analyses compared the performance of GARD with the NRG clinical nomogram for overall survival. ResultsDespite uniform radiation dose utilization, GARD showed significant heterogeneity (range 30-110), reflecting the underlying genomic differences in the cohort. On multivariable analysis, each unit increase in GARD was associated with an improvement in OS (HR = 0.951 (0.911, 0.993), p = 0.023) compared to AJCC8 (HR = 1.999 (0.791, 5.047)), p = 0.143). ROC analysis for GARD at 36 months yielded an AUC of 80. 6 (69.4, 91.9) compared with an AUC of 73.6 (55.4, 91.7) for the NRG clinical nomogram. GARD[\u0026ge;] 64.2 was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.280 (0.100, 0.781), p = 0.015). In a virtual trial, GARD predicts that uniform RT dose de-escalation results in overall inferior OS but proposes two separate genomic strategies where selective RT dose de-escalation in GARD-selected populations results in clinical equipoise. ConclusionsIn this multi-institutional cohort of patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, GARD predicts OS as a continuous variable, outperforms the NRG nomogram and provides a novel genomic strategy to modern clinical trial design. We propose that GARD, which provides the first opportunity for genomic guided personalization of radiation dose, should be incorporated in the diagnostic workup of HPV-positive OPSCC patients.\nMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphic variants in rectal cancer: significance for cancer risk and response to chemoradiotherapy\nAuthors: Stanojevic, A.; Spasic, J.; Marinkovic, M.; Stojanovic-Rundic, S.; Jankovic, R.; Djuric, A.; Zoidakis, J.; Fijneman, R.; Castellvi-Bel, S.; Cavic, M.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.23295916\nBackgroundMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been suggested as risk, prognostic, and predictive factors for colorectal cancer in various populations, but have not been validated so far. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) small nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of rectal cancer as well as the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) based on 5-Fluorouracil (5- FU)/leucovorin (LV) in the locally advanced setting. Patients and methodsA total of 102 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 119 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) was used for MTHFR genotyping ResultsUsing dominant and recessive models, it was found that the MTHFR 667C allele and the 1298A allele were significantly associated with rectal cancer as low-penetrant factors. Combined genotype analysis highlighted the protective role of the 677CT/1298AC genotype and increased risk for rectal cancer development for carriers of 677CC/1298AA. Haplotype analysis indicated that carriers of haplotype 677C/1298A have an increased risk for rectal cancer development while the haplotype 677T/1298A has a protective role. No significant association with response to chemoradiotherapy was found ConclusionOur data point to MTHFR 667C allele and 1298A alleles as low-penetrant risk factors for rectal cancer in our population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this type performed on the Slavic population in the Western Balkan area which might be useful for future meta-analyses and the construction of genetic cancer risk prediction panels, as various population-based factors might also be significant in this setting.\nDevelopment of a Neoadjuvant Treatment Pathway to Standardize Pancreatic Cancer Care and Improve Outcomes Across a Large Diverse Health System\nAuthors: Parakrama, R.; Sidiqi, B. U.; Demyan, L.; Standring, O.; Cooper, D. J.; Pasha, S.; Pinto, D. M.; Zavadsky, T.; Zou, X.; Patruni, S.; Kapusta, A.; Nosrati, J. D.; Tchelebi, L.; Weiss, M. J.; Herman, J. M.; King, D.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295749\nBackgroundManagement of localized pancreatic cancer is variable. We describe the development of a neoadjuvant therapy pathway (NATP) to standardize care across a large healthcare system. MethodsWe conducted an IRB-approved retrospective analysis of NATP patients between June 2019 and March 2022. The primary endpoint was NATP completion, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and quality measures. ResultsFifty-nine patients began NATP, median age 70, locally advanced 44.1%. Median time on NATP was 6.1 months. The initial chemotherapy was FOLFIRINOX (64.2%) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP; (35.6%)) followed by radiation in 32 (54.2%) patients. Forty-four (74.6%) completed the NATP and 30 (50.8%) underwent surgical exploration with 86.7% undergoing successful resection (61.5% R0, 23.1% R1) while 14 remained unresectable. NATP completion was associated with increased likelihood of resection (p\u003c0.001). At median follow-up of 13.4 months, median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 13.3- 28.5) and 1- and 2-year OS was 82.5% and 49.7%. NATP completion resulted in improved OS with median OS not reached and 1- and 2-year OS of 89.7% and 59.4% (p=0.004). Median time to NATP start was 20 days after MDR and median time to surgery was 35 days. Age, ECOG, surgical stage, chemotherapy regimen and NATP completion were significant univariable predictors of OS with ECOG status remaining significant on multivariable analysis. ConclusionOur outcomes provide a baseline for future guidance in improving care across a large system. Efforts to complete NATP and improve patient ECOG may result in more patients undergoing surgery and improve survival.\nQualitative exploration of patients' experiences with Intrabeam targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) and External-Beam Radiotherapy Treatment (EBRT).\nAuthors: Bagga, S. K.; Swiderska, N.; Hooker, C.; Ennis-O'Connor, M.; Freeney, S.; Watson, D.; Woolcock, R.\nScore: 1.6, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295478\nFor patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy is given either as a post-operative course of External-Beam RadioTherapy (EBRT), given daily for over a number of days and often weeks, or with TARGeted Intrabeam Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT), which is delivered, during surgery under the same anaesthetic. Several studies have reported the quantitative Quality-of-Life (QoL) benefits of TARGIT-IORT over EBRT. This qualitative study was designed to gather a deep understanding of the benefits and impacts of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT as perceived by patients. It also captured how differently the treatments affected the lived experience of the patient and their care partner through their treatment journey. A patient-led Working Group was established to guide study design, delivery and to help validate findings. Patients with experience of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT were first purposively sampled by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after which a randomiser was applied to ensure the final selection process was free from bias. In February and March 2023, 29 semi-structured interviews (15 EBRT, 14 TARGIT-IORT) were conducted virtually via Zoom. Thematic analysis of verbatim interview transcripts was then carried out by two coders generating 11 themes related to either EBRT or TARGIT-IORT. A number of procedural grievances were noted among EBRT patients. EBRT was perceived as being disruptive to a range of normal routines (work, home-life, and the burden of travel), and dissatisfying due to discomfort of side effects. TARGIT-IORT was perceived by patients and care partners as being efficient (given while they are asleep during surgery and without additional hospital visits) with minimal if any disruptions to QoL and that it was the safer option. The need for adequate, accessible information provision at the right time to reduce anxieties was noted in both cohorts. These new insights are valuable for healthcare staff and policy makers and could help incorporate the two treatments into routine practice. Further research is now needed to explore TARGIT-IORT in more diverse populations and in the 35 other countries where it is already a well- established treatment option.\nLong-read RNA sequencing redefines the clear cell renal cell carcinoma transcriptome and reveals novel genes and transcripts associated with disease recurrence and immune evasion\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Snell, E. A.; Brown, J.; Banks, R. E.; Turner, D. J.; Vasudev, N. S.; Lagos, D.\nScore: 13.6, Published: 2023-09-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.08.23295204\nBackgroundLong-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and PCR cDNA sequencing (PCS) of tumour samples could lead to discovery of novel transcript isoforms, novel genes, and transcriptomic co-dependencies missed by conventional short-read sequencing. However, only a handful of reports using DRS or PCS in cancer exist with no direct comparison between the two methods. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer. Following primary tumour resection approximately 30% of patients experience disease recurrence. Long-read RNA sequencing has not been applied to kidney cancer. Methods12 primary ccRCC archival tumours (discovery cohort), 6 from patients who went on to relapse, were analysed by Oxford Nanopore DRS and PCS. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 20 patients and compared to DRS analysis of RCC4 cells. ResultsDRS and PCS were successfully performed achieving high read length, with PCS achieving higher sequencing depth. Differentially expressed gene sets in patients who went on to relapse were determined with good overlap between DRS and PCS. Deconvolution analysis showed a loss of immune infiltrate in primary tumours of patients who relapse and revealed the CD8+ T cell exhaustion marker TOX as a novel recurrence-associated gene. Notably, novel transcript analysis revealed more than 10,000 uncharacterised candidate novel transcripts detected by both methods and in a ccRCC cell line in vitro. This allowed the definition of the full exonic structure of ccRCC-associated splice variants, including variants of MVK and HPCAL1. Remarkably, this also revealed a novel sPD-L1 transcript encoding for the soluble version of the protein with a longer 3UTR and lower stability in ccRCC cells than the annotated transcript. Levels of sPD-L1 transcripts are unchanged in primary tumours that go on to relapse, whereas membrane PD-L1 shows a trend towards down-regulation. Finally, both methods identified 414 novel genes, also detected in ccRCC cells in vitro, including a novel non-coding gene over-expressed in patients who relapse. ConclusionsPCS and DRS can be used in tumour samples to uncover substantial yet unmapped features underpinning the plasticity and instability of cancer transcriptomes which are linked to disease progression and immune evasion.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundTreatment decision-making in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) includes clinical stage, HPV status, and smoking history. Despite improvements in staging with separation of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC in AJCC 8th edition (AJCC8), patients are largely treated with a uniform approach, with recent efforts focused on de-intensification in low-risk patients. We have previously shown, in a pooled analysis, that the genomic adjusted radiation dose (GARD) is predictive of radiation treatment benefit and can be used to guide RT dose selection. We hypothesize that GARD can be used to predict overall survival (OS) in HPV-positive OPSCC patients treated with radiotherapy (RT).

MethodsGene expression profiles (Affymetrix Clariom D) were analyzed for 234 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from HPV-positive OPSCC patients within an international, multi-institutional, prospective/retrospective observational study including patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVb. GARD, a measure of the treatment effect of RT, was calculated for each patient as previously described. In total, 191 patients received primary RT definitive treatment (chemoradiation or RT alone, and 43 patients received post-operative RT. Two RT dose fractionations were utilized for primary RT cases (70 Gy in 35 fractions or 69.96 Gy in 33 fractions). Median RT dose was 70 Gy (range 50.88-74) for primary RT definitive cases and 66 Gy (range 44-70) for post-operative RT cases. The median follow up was 46.2 months (95% CI, 33.5-63.1). Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed with GARD as both a continuous and dichotomous variable and time-dependent ROC analyses compared the performance of GARD with the NRG clinical nomogram for overall survival.

ResultsDespite uniform radiation dose utilization, GARD showed significant heterogeneity (range 30-110), reflecting the underlying genomic differences in the cohort. On multivariable analysis, each unit increase in GARD was associated with an improvement in OS (HR = 0.951 (0.911, 0.993), p = 0.023) compared to AJCC8 (HR = 1.999 (0.791, 5.047)), p = 0.143). ROC analysis for GARD at 36 months yielded an AUC of 80. 6 (69.4, 91.9) compared with an AUC of 73.6 (55.4, 91.7) for the NRG clinical nomogram. GARD[&amp;ge;] 64.2 was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.280 (0.100, 0.781), p = 0.015). In a virtual trial, GARD predicts that uniform RT dose de-escalation results in overall inferior OS but proposes two separate genomic strategies where selective RT dose de-escalation in GARD-selected populations results in clinical equipoise.

ConclusionsIn this multi-institutional cohort of patients with HPV-positive OPSCC, GARD predicts OS as a continuous variable, outperforms the NRG nomogram and provides a novel genomic strategy to modern clinical trial design. We propose that GARD, which provides the first opportunity for genomic guided personalization of radiation dose, should be incorporated in the diagnostic workup of HPV-positive OPSCC patients.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been suggested as risk, prognostic, and predictive factors for colorectal cancer in various populations, but have not been validated so far. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of MTHFR C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) small nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of rectal cancer as well as the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) based on 5-Fluorouracil (5- FU)/leucovorin (LV) in the locally advanced setting.

Patients and methodsA total of 102 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 119 healthy controls were included in this case-control study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) was used for MTHFR genotyping

ResultsUsing dominant and recessive models, it was found that the MTHFR 667C allele and the 1298A allele were significantly associated with rectal cancer as low-penetrant factors. Combined genotype analysis highlighted the protective role of the 677CT/1298AC genotype and increased risk for rectal cancer development for carriers of 677CC/1298AA. Haplotype analysis indicated that carriers of haplotype 677C/1298A have an increased risk for rectal cancer development while the haplotype 677T/1298A has a protective role. No significant association with response to chemoradiotherapy was found

ConclusionOur data point to MTHFR 667C allele and 1298A alleles as low-penetrant risk factors for rectal cancer in our population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this type performed on the Slavic population in the Western Balkan area which might be useful for future meta-analyses and the construction of genetic cancer risk prediction panels, as various population-based factors might also be significant in this setting.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundManagement of localized pancreatic cancer is variable. We describe the development of a neoadjuvant therapy pathway (NATP) to standardize care across a large healthcare system.

MethodsWe conducted an IRB-approved retrospective analysis of NATP patients between June 2019 and March 2022. The primary endpoint was NATP completion, and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and quality measures.

ResultsFifty-nine patients began NATP, median age 70, locally advanced 44.1%. Median time on NATP was 6.1 months. The initial chemotherapy was FOLFIRINOX (64.2%) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GnP; (35.6%)) followed by radiation in 32 (54.2%) patients. Forty-four (74.6%) completed the NATP and 30 (50.8%) underwent surgical exploration with 86.7% undergoing successful resection (61.5% R0, 23.1% R1) while 14 remained unresectable. NATP completion was associated with increased likelihood of resection (p&lt;0.001). At median follow-up of 13.4 months, median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI 13.3- 28.5) and 1- and 2-year OS was 82.5% and 49.7%. NATP completion resulted in improved OS with median OS not reached and 1- and 2-year OS of 89.7% and 59.4% (p=0.004). Median time to NATP start was 20 days after MDR and median time to surgery was 35 days. Age, ECOG, surgical stage, chemotherapy regimen and NATP completion were significant univariable predictors of OS with ECOG status remaining significant on multivariable analysis.

ConclusionOur outcomes provide a baseline for future guidance in improving care across a large system. Efforts to complete NATP and improve patient ECOG may result in more patients undergoing surgery and improve survival.</p>

        <p class="abstract">For patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy is given either as a post-operative course of External-Beam RadioTherapy (EBRT), given daily for over a number of days and often weeks, or with TARGeted Intrabeam Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT-IORT), which is delivered, during surgery under the same anaesthetic. Several studies have reported the quantitative Quality-of-Life (QoL) benefits of TARGIT-IORT over EBRT. This qualitative study was designed to gather a deep understanding of the benefits and impacts of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT as perceived by patients. It also captured how differently the treatments affected the lived experience of the patient and their care partner through their treatment journey.

A patient-led Working Group was established to guide study design, delivery and to help validate findings. Patients with experience of receiving EBRT or TARGIT-IORT were first purposively sampled by Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after which a randomiser was applied to ensure the final selection process was free from bias. In February and March 2023, 29 semi-structured interviews (15 EBRT, 14 TARGIT-IORT) were conducted virtually via Zoom. Thematic analysis of verbatim interview transcripts was then carried out by two coders generating 11 themes related to either EBRT or TARGIT-IORT.

A number of procedural grievances were noted among EBRT patients. EBRT was perceived as being disruptive to a range of normal routines (work, home-life, and the burden of travel), and dissatisfying due to discomfort of side effects. TARGIT-IORT was perceived by patients and care partners as being efficient (given while they are asleep during surgery and without additional hospital visits) with minimal if any disruptions to QoL and that it was the safer option. The need for adequate, accessible information provision at the right time to reduce anxieties was noted in both cohorts. These new insights are valuable for healthcare staff and policy makers and could help incorporate the two treatments into routine practice. Further research is now needed to explore TARGIT-IORT in more diverse populations and in the 35 other countries where it is already a well- established treatment option.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundLong-read direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and PCR cDNA sequencing (PCS) of tumour samples could lead to discovery of novel transcript isoforms, novel genes, and transcriptomic co-dependencies missed by conventional short-read sequencing. However, only a handful of reports using DRS or PCS in cancer exist with no direct comparison between the two methods. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer. Following primary tumour resection approximately 30% of patients experience disease recurrence. Long-read RNA sequencing has not been applied to kidney cancer.

Methods12 primary ccRCC archival tumours (discovery cohort), 6 from patients who went on to relapse, were analysed by Oxford Nanopore DRS and PCS. Results were validated in an independent cohort of 20 patients and compared to DRS analysis of RCC4 cells.

ResultsDRS and PCS were successfully performed achieving high read length, with PCS achieving higher sequencing depth. Differentially expressed gene sets in patients who went on to relapse were determined with good overlap between DRS and PCS. Deconvolution analysis showed a loss of immune infiltrate in primary tumours of patients who relapse and revealed the CD8&#43; T cell exhaustion marker TOX as a novel recurrence-associated gene. Notably, novel transcript analysis revealed more than 10,000 uncharacterised candidate novel transcripts detected by both methods and in a ccRCC cell line in vitro. This allowed the definition of the full exonic structure of ccRCC-associated splice variants, including variants of MVK and HPCAL1. Remarkably, this also revealed a novel sPD-L1 transcript encoding for the soluble version of the protein with a longer 3UTR and lower stability in ccRCC cells than the annotated transcript. Levels of sPD-L1 transcripts are unchanged in primary tumours that go on to relapse, whereas membrane PD-L1 shows a trend towards down-regulation. Finally, both methods identified 414 novel genes, also detected in ccRCC cells in vitro, including a novel non-coding gene over-expressed in patients who relapse.

ConclusionsPCS and DRS can be used in tumour samples to uncover substantial yet unmapped features underpinning the plasticity and instability of cancer transcriptomes which are linked to disease progression and immune evasion.</p>
