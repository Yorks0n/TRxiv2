Amino acid-changing mutations affect pleiotropic functions of proteins, although little is known about how mutated proteins are adapted in existing developmental programs. Here we investigate the biological effects of a variant of the GLI3 transcription factor (GLI3R1537C) carried in Neanderthals and Denisovans, which are extinct hominins close to modern humans. R1537C does not compromise protein stability or GLI3 activator-dependent transcriptional activities. In contrast, R1537C affects the regulation of downstream target genes associated with developmental processes. Furthermore, genome-edited mice carrying the Neanderthal/Denisovan GLI3 mutation exhibited various alterations in skeletal morphology. Our data suggest that an extinct hominin-type GLI3 contributes to species-specific anatomical variations, which were tolerated by relaxed constraint in developmental programs during human evolution.\nEnamel proteins reveal biological sex and genetic variability within southern African Paranthropus\nAuthors: Madupe, P.

R.; Cappellini, E.\nScore: 48.4, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547326\nThe evolutionary relationships among extinct African hominin taxa are highly debated and largely unresolved, due in part to a lack of molecular data. Even within taxa, it is not always clear, based on morphology alone, whether ranges of variation are due to sexual dimorphism versus potentially undescribed taxonomic diversity. For Paranthropus robustus, a Pleistocene hominin found only in South Africa, both phylogenetic relationships to other taxa 1,2 and the nature of intraspecific variation 3-6 are still disputed. Here we report the mass spectrometric (MS) sequencing of enamel proteomes from four ca. 2 million year (Ma) old dental specimens attributed morphologically to P. robustus, from the site of Swartkrans. The identification of AMELY-specific peptides and semi-quantitative MS data analysis enabled us to determine the biological sex of all the specimens. Our combined molecular and morphometric data also provide compelling evidence of a significant degree of variation within southern African Paranthropus, as previously suggested based on morphology alone 6. Finally, the molecular data also confirm the taxonomic placement of Paranthropus within the hominin clade. This study demonstrates the feasibility of recovering informative Early Pleistocene hominin enamel proteins from Africa. Crucially, it also shows how the analysis of these proteins can contribute to understanding whether hominin morphological variation is due to sexual dimorphism or to taxonomic differences. We anticipate that this approach can be widely applied to geologically-comparable sites within South Africa, and possibly more broadly across the continent.\nSeveral independent adaptations of archaea to hypersaline environments\nAuthors: Baker, B. A.; Gutierrez-Preciado, A.; Rodriguez del Rio, A.; McCarthy, C.; Lopez-Garcia, P.; Huerta-Cepas, J.; Susko, E.; Roger, A. J.; Eme, L.; Moreira, D.\nScore: 25.3, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547478\nSeveral archaeal lineages thrive in high, saturating salt concentrations. These extremely halophilic archaea, including Halobacteria, Nanohaloarchaeota, Methanonatronarchaeia, and Haloplasmatales, must maintain osmotic equilibrium with their environment. For this, they use a salt-in strategy, which involves pumping molar concentrations of potassium into the cells, which, in turn, has led to extensive proteome-wide modifications to prevent protein aggregation. However, the evolutionary history underlying these adaptations remains poorly understood. In particular, the number of times that these dramatic proteome-sweeping changes occurred is unclear due to the conflicting phylogenetic positions found for several of these lineages. Here, we present a resolved phylogeny of extremely halophilic archaea obtained using improved taxon sampling and state-of-the-art phylogenetic approaches designed to cope with the strong compositional biases of their proteomes. We describe two new uncultured lineages, Afararchaeaceae and Asboarchaeaceae, which break the long branches at the base of Haloarchaea and Nanohaloarchaeota, respectively. Our extensive phylogenomic analyses show that at least four independent adaptations to extreme halophily occurred during archaeal evolution. Finally, gene-tree/species-tree reconciliation suggests that gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer played an important role in this process, for example, by spreading key genes (such as those encoding potassium transporters) across the various extremely halophilic lineages.\nPhylogenetic conflicts: distinguishing gene flow from incomplete lineage sorting\nAuthors: Galtier, N.\nScore: 18.1, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.06.547897\nGene flow and incomplete lineage sorting are two distinct sources of phylogenetic conflict, i.e., gene trees that differ in topology from each other and from the species tree. Distinguishing between the two processes is a key objective of current evolutionary genomics. This is most often pursued via the so-called ABBA-BABA type of method, which relies on a prediction of symmetry of gene tree discordance made by the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis. Gene flow, however, need not be asymmetric, and the ABBA-BABA hypothesis-testing approach is not a proper way of measuring gene flow prevalence. We introduce Aphid, a maximum-likelihood method aimed at quantifying the sources of phylogenetic conflict via topology and branch length analysis of three-species gene trees. Aphid draws information from the fact that gene trees affected by gene flow tend to have shorter branches, and gene trees affected by incomplete lineage sorting longer branches, than the average gene tree. Accounting for the among-loci variance in mutation rate and gene flow time, Aphid returns estimates of the speciation times and ancestral effective population size, and a posterior assessment of the contribution of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting to the conflict. Simulations suggest that Aphid is reasonably robust to a wide range of conditions. An analysis of exon trees in mammals illustrates the potential of the approach. Notably, Aphid predicts that roughly half of the human/chimpanzee/gorilla phylogenetic conflict is due to ancient gene flow. This also translates in older estimated speciation times and a smaller estimated effective population size in this group, compared to existing analyses assuming no gene flow.\nDeep Divergences Among Cryptic Clades of Epipedobates Poison Frogs\nAuthors: Lopez-Hervas, K.; Santos, J. C.; Ron, S. R.; Betancourth-Cundar, M.; Cannatella, D. C.; Tarvin, R. D.\nScore: 32.1, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.29.547117\nPoison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are famous for their aposematic species, having a combination of diverse color patterns and defensive skin toxins, yet most species in this family are inconspicuous (cryptic) and considered non-aposematic. Epipedobates is among the youngest genus-level clades of Dendrobatidae that includes both aposematic and cryptic species. Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we demonstrate deep genetic divergences among cryptic species of Epipedobates but relatively shallow genetic divergences among conspicuous species. Our phylogenetic analysis includes broad geographic sampling of the cryptic lineages typically identified as E. boulengeri and E. espinosai, which reveals two putative new species, one in west-central Colombia (E. sp. 1) and the other in north-central Ecuador (E. aff. espinosai). We conclude that E. darwinwallacei is a junior subjective synonym of E. espinosai. We also clarify the geographic distributions of cryptic Epipedobates species including the widespread E. boulengeri. We provide a qualitative assessment of the phenotypic diversity in each nominal species, with a focus on the color and pattern of cryptic species. We conclude that Epipedobates contains eight known valid species, six of which are cryptic. A relaxed molecular clock analysis suggests that the most recent common ancestor of Epipedobates is [~]11.1 million years old, which nearly doubles previous estimates. Last, genetic information points to a center of species diversity in the Choco at the southwestern border of Colombia with Ecuador. ResumenLas ranas venenosas (Dendrobatidae) son famosas por sus especies aposematicas, que se caracterizan por una combinacion de diversos patrones de color y toxinas cutaneas defensivas. Sin embargo, la mayoria de las especies de esta familia son cripticas y no se consideran aposematicas. Epipedobates se encuentra entre los clados mas jovenes a nivel de genero de Dendrobatidae que incluye especies tanto aposematicas como cripticas. Usando marcadores mitocondriales y nucleares, demostramos profundas divergencias geneticas entre especies cripticas de Epipedobates pero divergencias geneticas relativamente superficiales entre especies conspicuas. Nuestro analisis filogenetico incluye un amplio muestreo geografico de los linajes cripticos tipicamente identificados como E. boulengeri y E. espinosai. Los resultados revelan dos nuevas especies putativas, una en el centro-oeste de Colombia (E. sp. 1) y la otra en el centro-norte de Ecuador (E. aff. espinosai). Determinamos que E. darwinwallacei es un sinonimo subjetivo menor de E. espinosai y aclaramos las distribuciones geograficas de las especies cripticas de Epipedobates, incluyendo E. boulengeri. Con una evaluacion cualitativa enfocado en el color y el patron de las especies cripticas describimos la diversidad fenotipica en cada especie nominal. Concluimos que el genero Epipedobates contiene ocho especies validas conocidas, seis de las cuales son en su mayoria cripticas. Un analisis de reloj molecular relajado nos sugiere que el ancestro comun mas reciente de Epipedobates tiene [~]11,1 millones de anos, lo que casi duplica las estimaciones anteriores. Por ultimo, la informacion genetica apunta a un centro de diversidad de especies en el Choco en la frontera suroeste de Colombia con Ecuador.\nSugar assimilation underlying dietary evolution of Neotropical bats\nAuthors: Camacho, J.; Bernal-Rivera, A.; Robb, S.; Russell, J.; Yi, K.; Tsuchiya, D.; Wang, Y.; Murillo-Garcia, O. E.; Rohner, N.\nScore: 14.8, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547432\nSpecializations in animal diets drive selective demands on morphology, anatomy, and physiology. Studying adaptations linked to diet evolution benefits from examining Neotropical bats, a remarkable group with high taxonomic and trophic diversity. In this study we performed glucose tolerance tests on wild-caught bats, which revealed distinct responses to three sugars present in different foods: trehalose (insects), sucrose and glucose (fruits and nectar). Insect eating bats responded most strongly to trehalose, while bats with nectar and fruit-based diets exhibited heightened response to glucose and sucrose, reaching blood sugar levels over 600 mg/dL. To reveal positive selection in sugar assimilation genes we performed genome analysis of 22 focal bat species and 2 outgroup species. We identified selection in the ancestral vespertilionid branch (insect-eaters) for the digestive enzyme Trehalase, while sucrase-isomaltase exhibited selection in branches leading to omnivorous and nectar diets. Unexpectedly, the insect-eating lineage Myotis exhibited sucrase-isomaltase selection, potentially explaining their heightened sucrose assimilation. Furthermore, the glucose transporters SLC2A3 and SLC2A2 showed selection in lineages associated with nectar and blood diets. By examining cellular features of the small intestine, we discovered that sugar consumption strongly impacted numerous digestive traits, providing valuable insight into the physiological implications of the identified molecular adaptations. To elucidate this further, we used HCR RNA-FISH to perform single molecule ex vivo gene expression analysis of enterocyte response to a glucose meal in three focal species. We observed unusually high activity in the glucose transporter Slc2a2 during the fasted state of nectar bats that did not change upon feeding. Comparatively, nectar bats exhibited an enhanced capacity for intestinal absorption of dietary sugar primarily through Slc2a2, while fruit bats relied on increasing levels of Slc5a1. Overall, this study highlights the intricate interplay between molecular, morphological, and physiological aspects of diet evolution and provides new insights to our understanding of sugar assimilation mechanisms in mammals.

Such interactions are rapidly reversible and often occur at low affinity. The protein kinase domain represents one such binding module, and known substrates may have full or only partial matches to the kinase recognition motif, a property known as substrate quality. However, it is not yet clear whether differences in substrate quality represent neutral variation along the phosphosite sequence or if these differences have functional consequences that are subject to selection. We explore this question in detail for the acidophilic kinase CK2. CK2 is well-characterised, clinically important, and a fundamental enzyme for many aspects of cell biology. We show that optimal CK2 sites are phosphorylated at maximal stoichiometries and found in many conditions whereas minimal substrates are phosphorylated at lower stoichiometries, are more dynamic during the cell cycle, and have regulatory functions. Optimal CK2 sites also tend to be older and more conserved than minimal sites, and evolutionary simulations indicate that the substrate quality of CK2 phosphosites is often tuned by selection. For intermediate target sites, increases or decreases to substrate quality may be deleterious, which we demonstrate experimentally for a CK2 substrate at the kinetochore. The results together suggest that minimal and optimal phosphosites are strongly differentiated in terms of their functional and evolutionary properties.\nHigh germline mutation rates but not extreme population size outbreaks influence genetic diversity in crown-of-thorns sea stars\nAuthors: Popovic, I.; Bergeron, L.; Bozec, Y.-M.; Waldvogel, A.-M.; Howitt, S. M.; Damjanovic, K.; Patel, F.; Cabrera, M. G.; Wörheide, G.; Uthicke, S.; Riginos, C.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-06-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546961\nLewontins paradox, the observation that levels of genetic diversity ({pi}) among animals do not scale linearly with variation in census population sizes (Nc), is an evolutionary conundrum, where the most extreme mismatches between {pi} and Nc are found for highly abundant marine invertebrates. Yet, whether new mutations influence {pi} relative to extrinsic processes remains unknown for most taxa. Here, we provide the first direct germline mutation rate () estimate for a marine invertebrate, using high-coverage (60x) whole-genome sequencing of wild-caught Acanthaster cf. solaris crown-of-thorns sea stars (Echinodermata). We also provide empirical estimates of adult Nc in Australias Great Barrier Reef to jointly examine the determinants of {pi}. Based on direct observations of 63 de novo mutations across 14 parent-offspring trios, the A. cf. solaris mean was 9.13 x 10-09 mutations per-site per-generation (95% CI: 6.51 x 10-09 to 1.18 x 10-08). This value exceeds estimates for other invertebrates, showing greater concordance with reported vertebrate germline mutation rates. Lower-than-expected Ne ([~]70,000-180,000) and low Ne/Nc values (0.0047-0.048) indicated significant genetic drift and weak influences of contemporary population outbreaks on long-term {pi}. Our findings of elevated and low Ne in A. cf. solaris may help explain high mutational loads and extreme polymorphism levels observed in some marine invertebrate taxa and are consistent with evolving in response to Ne (drift-barrier hypothesis). This study advances our understanding of the processes controlling levels of natural genetic variation and provides new data valuable for further testing hypotheses about mutation rate evolution across animal phyla.\nLarge-scale phylogenomics uncovers a complex evolutionary history and extensive ancestral gene flow in an African primate radiation\nAuthors: Jensen, A.; Swift, F.; de Vries, D.; Beck, R.; Kuderna, L. F. K.; Knauf, S.; Chuma, I. S.; Keyyu, J. D.; Kitchener, A. C.; Farh, K.; Rogers, J.; Marques-Bonet, T.; Detwiler, K. M.; Roos, C.; Guschanski, K.\nScore: 21.1, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.21.545890\nUnderstanding the drivers of speciation is fundamental in evolutionary biology, and recent studies highlight hybridization as a potential facilitator of adaptive radiations. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 22 species of guenons (tribe Cercopithecini), one of the worlds largest primate radiations, we show that rampant gene flow characterizes their evolutionary history, and identify ancient hybridization across deeply divergent lineages differing in ecology, morphology and karyotypes. Lineages experiencing gene flow tend to be more species-rich than non-admixed lineages. Mitochondrial transfers between distant lineages were likely facilitated by co-introgression of co-adapted nuclear variants. Although the genomic landscapes of introgression were largely lineage specific, we found that genes with immune functions were overrepresented in introgressing regions, in line with adaptive introgression, whereas genes involved in pigmentation and morphology may contribute to reproductive isolation. This study provides important insights into the prevalence, role and outcomes of ancestral hybridization in a large mammalian radiation.\nEvolution of circadian behavioral plasticity through cis-regulatory divergence of a neuropeptide gene\nAuthors: Shahandeh, M. P.; Abuin, L.; Lescuyer De Decker, L.; Cergneux, J.; Koch, R.; Nagoshi, E.; Benton, R.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-07-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.05.547553\nWidely-distributed species experience substantial environmental variation, which they often accommodate through behavioral plasticity. Although this ability is integral to fitness, we have little understanding of the mechanistic basis by which plasticity evolves. One factor that varies seasonally and by latitude is photoperiod (day length). Many organisms, including the cosmopolitan Drosophila melanogaster display circadian plasticity, adjusting to fluctuating photoperiod by varying the timing of their activity to coincide with changing dawn/dusk intervals (1). Here, we compare D. melanogaster with the closely-related ecological specialist Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial island endemic that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the molecular-genetic basis of circadian plasticity evolution (2,3). We discover that D. sechellia displays exceptionally little circadian plasticity compared to D. melanogaster and other non-equatorial drosophilids. Through a screen of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids, we identify a role of the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) in this loss. While the coding sequence of Pdf is conserved, we show that Pdf has undergone cis-regulatory divergence in these drosophilids. We document species-specific temporal dynamic properties of Pdf RNA and protein expression, as well as Pdf neuron morphological plasticity, and demonstrate that modulating Pdf expression in D. melanogaster can influence the degree of behavioral plasticity. Furthermore, we find that the Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. Finally, we provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at higher latitudes, while D. sechellia likely suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our work defines Pdf as a locus of evolution for circadian plasticity, which might have contributed to both D. melanogaster's global distribution and D. sechellia's habitat specialization.

        <p class="abstract">Changes in genomic structures underlie phenotypic diversification in organisms. Amino acid-changing mutations affect pleiotropic functions of proteins, although little is known about how mutated proteins are adapted in existing developmental programs. Here we investigate the biological effects of a variant of the GLI3 transcription factor (GLI3R1537C) carried in Neanderthals and Denisovans, which are extinct hominins close to modern humans. R1537C does not compromise protein stability or GLI3 activator-dependent transcriptional activities. In contrast, R1537C affects the regulation of downstream target genes associated with developmental processes. Furthermore, genome-edited mice carrying the Neanderthal/Denisovan GLI3 mutation exhibited various alterations in skeletal morphology. Our data suggest that an extinct hominin-type GLI3 contributes to species-specific anatomical variations, which were tolerated by relaxed constraint in developmental programs during human evolution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The evolutionary relationships among extinct African hominin taxa are highly debated and largely unresolved, due in part to a lack of molecular data. Even within taxa, it is not always clear, based on morphology alone, whether ranges of variation are due to sexual dimorphism versus potentially undescribed taxonomic diversity. For Paranthropus robustus, a Pleistocene hominin found only in South Africa, both phylogenetic relationships to other taxa 1,2 and the nature of intraspecific variation 3-6 are still disputed. Here we report the mass spectrometric (MS) sequencing of enamel proteomes from four ca. 2 million year (Ma) old dental specimens attributed morphologically to P. robustus, from the site of Swartkrans. The identification of AMELY-specific peptides and semi-quantitative MS data analysis enabled us to determine the biological sex of all the specimens. Our combined molecular and morphometric data also provide compelling evidence of a significant degree of variation within southern African Paranthropus, as previously suggested based on morphology alone 6. Finally, the molecular data also confirm the taxonomic placement of Paranthropus within the hominin clade. This study demonstrates the feasibility of recovering informative Early Pleistocene hominin enamel proteins from Africa. Crucially, it also shows how the analysis of these proteins can contribute to understanding whether hominin morphological variation is due to sexual dimorphism or to taxonomic differences. We anticipate that this approach can be widely applied to geologically-comparable sites within South Africa, and possibly more broadly across the continent.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several archaeal lineages thrive in high, saturating salt concentrations. These extremely halophilic archaea, including Halobacteria, Nanohaloarchaeota, Methanonatronarchaeia, and Haloplasmatales, must maintain osmotic equilibrium with their environment. For this, they use a  salt-in strategy, which involves pumping molar concentrations of potassium into the cells, which, in turn, has led to extensive proteome-wide modifications to prevent protein aggregation. However, the evolutionary history underlying these adaptations remains poorly understood. In particular, the number of times that these dramatic proteome-sweeping changes occurred is unclear due to the conflicting phylogenetic positions found for several of these lineages. Here, we present a resolved phylogeny of extremely halophilic archaea obtained using improved taxon sampling and state-of-the-art phylogenetic approaches designed to cope with the strong compositional biases of their proteomes. We describe two new uncultured lineages, Afararchaeaceae and Asboarchaeaceae, which break the long branches at the base of Haloarchaea and Nanohaloarchaeota, respectively. Our extensive phylogenomic analyses show that at least four independent adaptations to extreme halophily occurred during archaeal evolution. Finally, gene-tree/species-tree reconciliation suggests that gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer played an important role in this process, for example, by spreading key genes (such as those encoding potassium transporters) across the various extremely halophilic lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting are two distinct sources of phylogenetic conflict, i.e., gene trees that differ in topology from each other and from the species tree. Distinguishing between the two processes is a key objective of current evolutionary genomics. This is most often pursued via the so-called ABBA-BABA type of method, which relies on a prediction of symmetry of gene tree discordance made by the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis. Gene flow, however, need not be asymmetric, and the ABBA-BABA hypothesis-testing approach is not a proper way of measuring gene flow prevalence. We introduce Aphid, a maximum-likelihood method aimed at quantifying the sources of phylogenetic conflict via topology and branch length analysis of three-species gene trees. Aphid draws information from the fact that gene trees affected by gene flow tend to have shorter branches, and gene trees affected by incomplete lineage sorting longer branches, than the average gene tree. Accounting for the among-loci variance in mutation rate and gene flow time, Aphid returns estimates of the speciation times and ancestral effective population size, and a posterior assessment of the contribution of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting to the conflict. Simulations suggest that Aphid is reasonably robust to a wide range of conditions. An analysis of exon trees in mammals illustrates the potential of the approach. Notably, Aphid predicts that roughly half of the human/chimpanzee/gorilla phylogenetic conflict is due to ancient gene flow. This also translates in older estimated speciation times and a smaller estimated effective population size in this group, compared to existing analyses assuming no gene flow.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are famous for their aposematic species, having a combination of diverse color patterns and defensive skin toxins, yet most species in this family are inconspicuous (cryptic) and considered non-aposematic. Epipedobates is among the youngest genus-level clades of Dendrobatidae that includes both aposematic and cryptic species. Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we demonstrate deep genetic divergences among cryptic species of Epipedobates but relatively shallow genetic divergences among conspicuous species. Our phylogenetic analysis includes broad geographic sampling of the cryptic lineages typically identified as E. boulengeri and E. espinosai, which reveals two putative new species, one in west-central Colombia (E. sp. 1) and the other in north-central Ecuador (E. aff. espinosai). We conclude that E. darwinwallacei is a junior subjective synonym of E. espinosai. We also clarify the geographic distributions of cryptic Epipedobates species including the widespread E. boulengeri. We provide a qualitative assessment of the phenotypic diversity in each nominal species, with a focus on the color and pattern of cryptic species. We conclude that Epipedobates contains eight known valid species, six of which are cryptic. A relaxed molecular clock analysis suggests that the most recent common ancestor of Epipedobates is [~]11.1 million years old, which nearly doubles previous estimates. Last, genetic information points to a center of species diversity in the Choco at the southwestern border of Colombia with Ecuador.

ResumenLas ranas venenosas (Dendrobatidae) son famosas por sus especies aposematicas, que se caracterizan por una combinacion de diversos patrones de color y toxinas cutaneas defensivas. Sin embargo, la mayoria de las especies de esta familia son cripticas y no se consideran aposematicas. Epipedobates se encuentra entre los clados mas jovenes a nivel de genero de Dendrobatidae que incluye especies tanto aposematicas como cripticas. Usando marcadores mitocondriales y nucleares, demostramos profundas divergencias geneticas entre especies cripticas de Epipedobates pero divergencias geneticas relativamente superficiales entre especies conspicuas. Nuestro analisis filogenetico incluye un amplio muestreo geografico de los linajes cripticos tipicamente identificados como E. boulengeri y E. espinosai. Los resultados revelan dos nuevas especies putativas, una en el centro-oeste de Colombia (E. sp. 1) y la otra en el centro-norte de Ecuador (E. aff. espinosai). Determinamos que E. darwinwallacei es un sinonimo subjetivo menor de E. espinosai y aclaramos las distribuciones geograficas de las especies cripticas de Epipedobates, incluyendo E. boulengeri. Con una evaluacion cualitativa enfocado en el color y el patron de las especies cripticas describimos la diversidad fenotipica en cada especie nominal. Concluimos que el genero Epipedobates contiene ocho especies validas conocidas, seis de las cuales son en su mayoria cripticas. Un analisis de reloj molecular relajado nos sugiere que el ancestro comun mas reciente de Epipedobates tiene [~]11,1 millones de anos, lo que casi duplica las estimaciones anteriores. Por ultimo, la informacion genetica apunta a un centro de diversidad de especies en el Choco en la frontera suroeste de Colombia con Ecuador.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Specializations in animal diets drive selective demands on morphology, anatomy, and physiology. Studying adaptations linked to diet evolution benefits from examining Neotropical bats, a remarkable group with high taxonomic and trophic diversity. In this study we performed glucose tolerance tests on wild-caught bats, which revealed distinct responses to three sugars present in different foods: trehalose (insects), sucrose and glucose (fruits and nectar). Insect eating bats responded most strongly to trehalose, while bats with nectar and fruit-based diets exhibited heightened response to glucose and sucrose, reaching blood sugar levels over 600 mg/dL. To reveal positive selection in sugar assimilation genes we performed genome analysis of 22 focal bat species and 2 outgroup species. We identified selection in the ancestral vespertilionid branch (insect-eaters) for the digestive enzyme Trehalase, while sucrase-isomaltase exhibited selection in branches leading to omnivorous and nectar diets. Unexpectedly, the insect-eating lineage Myotis exhibited sucrase-isomaltase selection, potentially explaining their heightened sucrose assimilation. Furthermore, the glucose transporters SLC2A3 and SLC2A2 showed selection in lineages associated with nectar and blood diets. By examining cellular features of the small intestine, we discovered that sugar consumption strongly impacted numerous digestive traits, providing valuable insight into the physiological implications of the identified molecular adaptations. To elucidate this further, we used HCR RNA-FISH to perform single molecule ex vivo gene expression analysis of enterocyte response to a glucose meal in three focal species. We observed unusually high activity in the glucose transporter Slc2a2 during the fasted state of nectar bats that did not change upon feeding. Comparatively, nectar bats exhibited an enhanced capacity for intestinal absorption of dietary sugar primarily through Slc2a2, while fruit bats relied on increasing levels of Slc5a1. Overall, this study highlights the intricate interplay between molecular, morphological, and physiological aspects of diet evolution and provides new insights to our understanding of sugar assimilation mechanisms in mammals.

        <p class="abstract">Most biological processes are regulated by peptide-recognition modules (PRMs) that bind to short linear motifs (SLiMs). Such interactions are rapidly reversible and often occur at low affinity. The protein kinase domain represents one such binding module, and known substrates may have full or only partial matches to the kinase recognition motif, a property known as  substrate quality. However, it is not yet clear whether differences in substrate quality represent neutral variation along the phosphosite sequence or if these differences have functional consequences that are subject to selection. We explore this question in detail for the acidophilic kinase CK2. CK2 is well-characterised, clinically important, and a fundamental enzyme for many aspects of cell biology. We show that optimal CK2 sites are phosphorylated at maximal stoichiometries and found in many conditions whereas minimal substrates are phosphorylated at lower stoichiometries, are more dynamic during the cell cycle, and have regulatory functions. Optimal CK2 sites also tend to be older and more conserved than minimal sites, and evolutionary simulations indicate that the substrate quality of CK2 phosphosites is often tuned by selection. For intermediate target sites, increases or decreases to substrate quality may be deleterious, which we demonstrate experimentally for a CK2 substrate at the kinetochore. The results together suggest that minimal and optimal phosphosites are strongly differentiated in terms of their functional and evolutionary properties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lewontins paradox, the observation that levels of genetic diversity ({pi}) among animals do not scale linearly with variation in census population sizes (Nc), is an evolutionary conundrum, where the most extreme mismatches between {pi} and Nc are found for highly abundant marine invertebrates. Yet, whether new mutations influence {pi} relative to extrinsic processes remains unknown for most taxa. Here, we provide the first direct germline mutation rate () estimate for a marine invertebrate, using high-coverage (60x) whole-genome sequencing of wild-caught Acanthaster cf. solaris crown-of-thorns sea stars (Echinodermata). We also provide empirical estimates of adult Nc in Australias Great Barrier Reef to jointly examine the determinants of {pi}. Based on direct observations of 63 de novo mutations across 14 parent-offspring trios, the A. cf. solaris mean  was 9.13 x 10-09 mutations per-site per-generation (95% CI: 6.51 x 10-09 to 1.18 x 10-08). This value exceeds estimates for other invertebrates, showing greater concordance with reported vertebrate germline mutation rates. Lower-than-expected Ne ([~]70,000-180,000) and low Ne/Nc values (0.0047-0.048) indicated significant genetic drift and weak influences of contemporary population outbreaks on long-term {pi}. Our findings of elevated  and low Ne in A. cf. solaris may help explain high mutational loads and extreme polymorphism levels observed in some marine invertebrate taxa and are consistent with  evolving in response to Ne (drift-barrier hypothesis). This study advances our understanding of the processes controlling levels of natural genetic variation and provides new data valuable for further testing hypotheses about mutation rate evolution across animal phyla.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the drivers of speciation is fundamental in evolutionary biology, and recent studies highlight hybridization as a potential facilitator of adaptive radiations. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 22 species of guenons (tribe Cercopithecini), one of the worlds largest primate radiations, we show that rampant gene flow characterizes their evolutionary history, and identify ancient hybridization across deeply divergent lineages differing in ecology, morphology and karyotypes. Lineages experiencing gene flow tend to be more species-rich than non-admixed lineages. Mitochondrial transfers between distant lineages were likely facilitated by co-introgression of co-adapted nuclear variants. Although the genomic landscapes of introgression were largely lineage specific, we found that genes with immune functions were overrepresented in introgressing regions, in line with adaptive introgression, whereas genes involved in pigmentation and morphology may contribute to reproductive isolation. This study provides important insights into the prevalence, role and outcomes of ancestral hybridization in a large mammalian radiation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Widely-distributed species experience substantial environmental variation, which they often accommodate through behavioral plasticity. Although this ability is integral to fitness, we have little understanding of the mechanistic basis by which plasticity evolves. One factor that varies seasonally and by latitude is photoperiod (day length). Many organisms, including the cosmopolitan Drosophila melanogaster display circadian plasticity, adjusting to fluctuating photoperiod by varying the timing of their activity to coincide with changing dawn/dusk intervals (1). Here, we compare D. melanogaster with the closely-related ecological specialist Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial island endemic that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the molecular-genetic basis of circadian plasticity evolution (2,3). We discover that D. sechellia displays exceptionally little circadian plasticity compared to D. melanogaster and other non-equatorial drosophilids. Through a screen of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids, we identify a role of the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) in this loss. While the coding sequence of Pdf is conserved, we show that Pdf has undergone cis-regulatory divergence in these drosophilids. We document species-specific temporal dynamic properties of Pdf RNA and protein expression, as well as Pdf neuron morphological plasticity, and demonstrate that modulating Pdf expression in D. melanogaster can influence the degree of behavioral plasticity. Furthermore, we find that the Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. Finally, we provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at higher latitudes, while D. sechellia likely suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our work defines Pdf as a locus of evolution for circadian plasticity, which might have contributed to both D. melanogaster&#39;s global distribution and D. sechellia&#39;s habitat specialization. Moreover, together with spatial changes in Pdf expression reported in high-latitude drosophilid species (4,5), our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot for circadian plasticity evolution.</p>
