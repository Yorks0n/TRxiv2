However, in many eukaryotes 5mC has gained complex roles in gene regulation beyond parasite control. Animals are a quintessential case for 5mC evolution, as they show widespread variability across lineages, ranging from gene regulation and transposable element control to loss of this base modification. Here we show that the protist closely related to animals Amoebidium appalachense features both transposon and gene body methylation, a pattern reminiscent of invertebrates and plants. Unexpectedly, large hypermethylated regions of the Amoebidium genome derive from viral insertions, including hundreds of endogenized giant viruses contributing 14% of the encoded genes, to an extent never reported before in any eukaryotic genome. Using a combination of inhibitors and functional genomic assays, we demonstrate that 5mC silences these giant virus insertions. Moreover, alternative Amoebidium isolates show polymorphic giant virus insertions, highlighting a dynamic process of infection, endogenization and purging. Our results indicate that 5mC is critical for the controlled co-existence of newly acquired viral DNA into eukaryotic genomes, making Amoebidium a unique model to understand the hybrid origins of eukaryotic genomes.\nA 39.8kb flavi-like virus uses a novel strategy for overcoming the RNA virus error threshold\nAuthors: Petrone, M. E.; Grove, J.; Mifsud, J. C. O.; Parry, R. H.; Marzinelli, E. M.; Holmes, E. C.\nScore: 40.1, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574764\nIt is commonly held that there is a fundamental relationship between genome size and error rate, manifest as a notional \"error threshold\" that sets an upper limit on genome sizes. The genome sizes of RNA viruses, which have intrinsically high mutation rates due to a lack of mechanisms for error correction, must therefore be small to avoid accumulating an excessive number of deleterious mutations that will ultimately lead to population extinction. The proposed exceptions to this evolutionary rule are RNA viruses from the order Nidovirales (such as coronaviruses) that encode an error correcting exonuclease, enabling them to reach genome lengths greater than 40kb. The recent discovery of large genome flavi-like viruses (Flaviviridae), which comprise genomes up to 27kb in length yet seemingly do not encode exonuclease domains, has led to the proposal that a proofreading mechanism is required to facilitate the expansion of RNA virus genomes above 30kb. Herein, we describe a 39.8kb flavi-like virus identified in a Haliclona sponge metatranscriptome that does not encode an exonuclease. Structural analysis revealed that this virus may have instead captured bacterial domains associated with nucleic acid metabolism that have not been previously found in RNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis placed this virus as a divergent pesti-like lineage, such that we have provisionally termed it Maximus pesti-like virus. This virus represents the first instance of a flavi-like virus achieving a genome size comparable to that of the Nidovirales and demonstrates that RNA viruses have evolved multiple solutions to overcome the error threshold.\nAncestral Sequence Reconstruction as a tool to detect and study de novo gene emergence\nAuthors: Vakirlis, N.; Acar, O.; Cherupally, V. K.; Carvunis, A.-R.\nScore: 25.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573862\nNew protein-coding genes can evolve from previously non-coding genomic regions through a process known as de novo gene emergence. Evidence suggests that this process has likely occurred throughout evolution and across the tree of life. Yet, confidently identifying de novo emerged genes remains challenging. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) is a promising approach for inferring whether a gene has emerged de novo or not, as it can enable us to inspect whether a given genomic locus ancestrally harbored protein-coding capacity. However, the use of ASR in the context of de novo emergence is still in its infancy and its capabilities, limitations, and overall potential are largely unknown. Notably, it is difficult to formally evaluate the protein-coding capacity of ancestral sequences, particularly when new gene candidates are short. How well-suited is ASR as a tool for the detection and study of de novo genes? Here, we address this question by designing an ASR workflow incorporating different tools and sets of parameters and by introducing a formal criterion that allows to estimate, within a desired level of confidence, when protein-coding capacity originated at a particular locus. Applying this workflow on [~]2,600 short, annotated budding yeast genes (\u003c1,000 nucleotides), we found that ASR robustly predicts an ancient origin for most widely conserved genes, which constitute \"easy\" cases. For less robust cases, we calculated a randomization-based empirical P-value estimating whether the observed conservation between the extant and ancestral reading frame could be attributed to chance. This formal criterion allowed us to pinpoint a branch of origin for most of the less robust cases, identifying 33 genes that can unequivocally be considered de novo originated since the split of the Saccharomyces genus, including 20 S. cerevisiae-specific genes. We find that the remaining, equivocal cases, may be explained by different evolutionary scenarios including rapid evolution and multiple losses, as well as a very recent de novo origin. Overall, our findings suggest that ASR is a valuable tool to study de novo gene emergence but should be applied with caution and awareness of its limitations.\nPervasive selective sweeps across human gut microbiomes\nAuthors: Garud, N.; Wolff, R.\nScore: 15.9, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573162\nThe human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species which are continually evolving within and across hosts. The ability to identify adaptations common to many host gut microbiomes would not only reveal shared selection pressures across hosts, but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, to date there has not been a systematic scan for adaptations that have spread across host microbiomes. Here, we develop a novel selection scan statistic, named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS), that can detect the spread of adaptive haplotypes across host microbiomes via migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with the beneficial variant, a common feature of adaptive evolution. We find that iLDS is capable of detecting simulated and known cases of selection, and moreover is robust to potential confounders that can also elevate LD. Application of the statistic to [~]20 common commensal gut species from a large cohort of healthy, Western adults reveals pervasive spread of selected alleles across human microbiomes mediated by horizontal gene transfer. Among the candidate selective sweeps recovered by iLDS is an enrichment for genes involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin, a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of Western diets. In summary, we demonstrate that selective sweeps across host microbiomes are a common feature of the evolution of the human gut microbiome.\nEvidence for compensatory evolution within pleiotropic regulatory elements\nAuthors: Kliesmete, Z.; Orchard, P.; Lee, V. Y. K.; Geuder, J.; Krauss, S. M.; Ohnuki, M.; Jocher, J.; Vieth, B.; Enard, W.; Hellmann, I.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575014\nPleiotropy, measured as expression breadth across tissues, is one of the best predictors for protein sequence and expression conservation. In this study, we investigated its effect on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). To this end, we carefully reanalyzed the Epigenomics Roadmap data for nine fetal tissues, assigning a measure of pleiotropic degree to nearly half a million CREs. To assess the functional conservation of CREs, we generated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from humans and macaques. We found that more pleiotropic CREs exhibit greater conservation in accessibility, and the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes are more conserved. This trend of higher conservation for higher degrees of pleiotropy persists when analyzing the transcription factor binding repertoire. In contrast, simple DNA sequence conservation of orthologous sites between species tends to be even lower for pleiotropic CREs than for species-specific CREs. Combining various lines of evidence, we suggest that the lack of sequence conservation for functionally conserved pleiotropic elements is due to compensatory evolution within these large pleiotropic CREs. Furthermore, for less pleiotropic CREs, we find an indication of compensation across CREs. This suggests that pleiotropy is also a good predictor for the functional conservation of CREs, but this is not reflected in the sequence conservation for pleiotropic CREs.\nMaternal Care Leads to the Evolution of Long, Slow Lives\nAuthors: Zipple, M. N.; Reeve, H. K.; Peniston, J. H.\nScore: 13.2, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574353\nAnimals, and mammals in particular, vary widely in their \"pace of life,\" with some species living long lives and reproducing infrequently (slow life histories) and others living short lives and reproducing often (fast life histories). These species also vary in the importance of maternal care in offspring fitness: in some species, offspring are fully independent of their mothers following a brief period of nutritional input, while others display a long period of continued dependence on mothers well after nutritional dependence. Here we hypothesize that these two axes of variation are causally related to each other, such that extended dependence of offspring on maternal presence leads to the evolution of longer lives at the expense of reproduction. We use a combination of deterministic modeling and stochastic agent-based modeling to explore how empirically-observed links between maternal survival and offspring fitness are likely to shape the evolution of mortality and fertility. Each of our modelling approaches leads to the same conclusion: when maternal survival has strong impacts on the survival of offspring and grandoffspring, populations evolve longer lives with less frequent reproduction. Our results suggest the slow life histories of humans and other primates as well as other long-lived, highly social animals such as hyenas, whales, and elephants, are partially the result of the strong maternal care that these animals display. We have designed our models to be readily parameterized with demographic data that is routinely collected by long-term researchers, which will facilitate more thorough testing of our hypothesis. Significance StatementHumans and other primates live longer lives and reproduce less often than other mammals of similar body mass. What is the cause of these long lives? Here we add to existing hypotheses, including the Mother and Grandmother hypotheses, by arguing that these increased lifespans are partially explained by the intense maternal care that many primates express. Using a combination of deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches, informed by empirical data, we show that stronger connections between maternal survival and offspring fitness leads to selection for longer lives and slower reproduction. Our models suggest that the importance of the mother-offspring relationship, which defines much of human and non-human primate lives, lies at the core of the evolution of our long lives.\nA complex mechanism translating variation of a simple genetic architecture into alternative life-histories\nAuthors: Verta, J.-P.; Moustakas-Verho, J.; Donner, I.; Frapin, M.; Ruokolainen, A.; Debes, P. V.; Erkinaro, J.; Primmer, C. R.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.05.574286\nLinking genes to traits is a central goal in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with trait differences, a poor understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying genetic associations leaves us critically far from connecting genetic and phenotypic variation. This knowledge-gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life-history traits. Using a multiomic dissection of the genotype-phenotype association in a large-effect maturation age gene - the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 (vgll3) - in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), we show that vgll3 mediates concerted changes of distinct molecular phenotypes associated with puberty in male gonads. Vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity upregulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-{beta} signaling, among others, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. Genotype-dependent developmental trajectories are produced through VGLL3 interaction with distinct transcription factors, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. These results reveal a genetically simple, yet functionally complex, architecture underlying alternative life-histories where variation in a single major effect gene produces pleiotropic variation in a spectrum of cellular traits. Our results further suggest that evolution in correlated phenotypes such as exemplified by alternative life history strategies may be mediated by a surprisingly simple genetic architecture.\nGut microbiota influences foraging onset without affecting division of labor and associated physiological hallmarks in honeybees\nAuthors: Liberti, J.; Frank, E. T.; Kay, T.; Kesner, L.; Monie-Ibanes, M.; Quinn, A.; Schmitt, T.; Keller, L.; Engel, P.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-12-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.570781\nGut microbes can impact cognition and behavior, but whether they regulate division of labor in animal societies is unknown. We addressed this question using honeybees since they exhibit division of labor between nurses and foragers and because their gut microbiota can be manipulated. Using automated behavioral tracking and controlling for co-housing effects, we show that gut microbes influence the age at which bees start foraging but have no effects on the time spent in a foraging area and number of foraging trips. Moreover, the gut microbiota did not influence hallmarks of behavioral maturation such as body weight, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, hypopharyngeal gland size, and the proportion of bees maturing into foragers. Overall, this study shows that the honeybee gut microbiota does not affect division of labor but rather plays an important function in controlling the onset of bee foraging.\nA new story of four Hexapoda classes: Protura as the sister to all other hexapods\nAuthors: Du, S.; Tihelka, E.; Yu, D.; Chen, W.-J.; Bu, Y.; Cai, C.; Engel, M. S.; Luan, Y.-X.; Zhang, F.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574592\nInsects represent the most diverse animal group, yet previous phylogenetic analyses based on the morphological and molecular data have failed to agree on the evolutionary relationships of early insects and their six-legged relatives (together constituting the clade Hexapoda). In particular, the phylogenetic positions of the three early-diverging hexapod groups, the coneheads (Protura), springtails (Collembola), and two-pronged bristletails (Diplura), have been debated for over a century, with alternative topologies implying drastically different scenarios of the evolution of the insect body plan and hexapod terrestrialisation. We addressed this issue by sampling of all hexapod orders, and experimented with a broad range of across-site compositional heterogeneous models designed to tackle ancient divergences. Our analyses support Protura as the earliest-diverging hexapod lineage (Protura-sister) and Collembola as a sister group to the Diplura, a clade we refer to as Antennomusculata characterised by the shared possession of internal muscles in the antennal flagellum. The universally recognized Ellipura hypothesis is recovered under the site-homogenous LG model. Our cross-validation analysis shows that the CAT-GTR model that recovers Protura-sister fits significantly better than homogenous model. Furthermore, as a very unusual group, Protura as the first diverging lineage of hexapods is also supported by other lines of evidence, such as mitogenomics, comparative embryology, and sperm morphology. The backbone phylogeny of hexapods recovered in this study will facilitate the exploration of the underpinnings of hexapod terrestrialisation and mega-diversity.\nDistinct ancient structural polymorphisms control heterodichogamy in walnuts and hickories\nAuthors: Groh, J. S.; Vik, D. C.; Stevens, K. A.; Brown, P. J.; Langley, C. H.; Coop, G.\nScore: 22.0, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.23.573205\nThe maintenance of stable mating type polymorphisms is a classic example of balancing selection, underlying the nearly ubiquitous 50/50 sex ratio in species with separate sexes. One lesser known but intriguing example of a balanced mating polymorphism in angiosperms is heterodichogamy - polymorphism for opposing directions of dichogamy (temporal separation of male and female function in hermaphrodites) within a flowering season. This mating system is common throughout Juglandaceae, the family that includes globally important and iconic nut and timber crops - walnuts (Juglans), as well as pecan and other hickories (Carya). We show that two distinct genetic systems control heterodichogamous mating systems in these genera. In each genus, we find ancient (\u003e50Mya) structural variants that segregate as trans-species polymorphisms. The Juglans locus maps to a ca. 20kb structural variant adjacent to gene with likely function in the trehalose-6-phosphate signaling pathway, which is known to regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis and inflorescence architecture in maize. Notably, an insertion in the dominant (protogynous) haplotype contains 8-12 complex tandem duplicates of the 3 UTR of the gene, and transpecies polymorphism within the gene is restricted to the 3 UTR. In contrast, the Carya heterodichogamy locus maps to a ca. 200-450 kb cluster of tightly linked polymorphisms across 20 genes, some of which have known roles in flowering and are differentially expressed between morphs in floral primordia. The dominant (protogynous) haplotype in pecan, which is nearly always heterozygous and appears to rarely recombine, shows reduced genetic diversity and is over twice as long as its recessive counterpart due to proliferation of multiple transposable element families. We did not detect either genetic system in another heterodichogamous genus within the Juglandaceae, suggesting that additional genetic systems for heterodichogamy may yet remain undiscovered.\n",

        <p class="abstract">5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a widespread silencing mechanism that controls genomic parasites. However, in many eukaryotes 5mC has gained complex roles in gene regulation beyond parasite control. Animals are a quintessential case for 5mC evolution, as they show widespread variability across lineages, ranging from gene regulation and transposable element control to loss of this base modification. Here we show that the protist closely related to animals Amoebidium appalachense features both transposon and gene body methylation, a pattern reminiscent of invertebrates and plants. Unexpectedly, large hypermethylated regions of the Amoebidium genome derive from viral insertions, including hundreds of endogenized giant viruses contributing 14% of the encoded genes, to an extent never reported before in any eukaryotic genome. Using a combination of inhibitors and functional genomic assays, we demonstrate that 5mC silences these giant virus insertions. Moreover, alternative Amoebidium isolates show polymorphic giant virus insertions, highlighting a dynamic process of infection, endogenization and purging. Our results indicate that 5mC is critical for the controlled co-existence of newly acquired viral DNA into eukaryotic genomes, making Amoebidium a unique model to understand the hybrid origins of eukaryotic genomes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">It is commonly held that there is a fundamental relationship between genome size and error rate, manifest as a notional &#34;error threshold&#34; that sets an upper limit on genome sizes. The genome sizes of RNA viruses, which have intrinsically high mutation rates due to a lack of mechanisms for error correction, must therefore be small to avoid accumulating an excessive number of deleterious mutations that will ultimately lead to population extinction. The proposed exceptions to this evolutionary rule are RNA viruses from the order Nidovirales (such as coronaviruses) that encode an error correcting exonuclease, enabling them to reach genome lengths greater than 40kb. The recent discovery of large genome flavi-like viruses (Flaviviridae), which comprise genomes up to 27kb in length yet seemingly do not encode exonuclease domains, has led to the proposal that a proofreading mechanism is required to facilitate the expansion of RNA virus genomes above 30kb. Herein, we describe a 39.8kb flavi-like virus identified in a Haliclona sponge metatranscriptome that does not encode an exonuclease. Structural analysis revealed that this virus may have instead captured bacterial domains associated with nucleic acid metabolism that have not been previously found in RNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis placed this virus as a divergent pesti-like lineage, such that we have provisionally termed it Maximus pesti-like virus. This virus represents the first instance of a flavi-like virus achieving a genome size comparable to that of the Nidovirales and demonstrates that RNA viruses have evolved multiple solutions to overcome the error threshold.</p>

        <p class="abstract">New protein-coding genes can evolve from previously non-coding genomic regions through a process known as de novo gene emergence. Evidence suggests that this process has likely occurred throughout evolution and across the tree of life. Yet, confidently identifying de novo emerged genes remains challenging. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) is a promising approach for inferring whether a gene has emerged de novo or not, as it can enable us to inspect whether a given genomic locus ancestrally harbored protein-coding capacity. However, the use of ASR in the context of de novo emergence is still in its infancy and its capabilities, limitations, and overall potential are largely unknown. Notably, it is difficult to formally evaluate the protein-coding capacity of ancestral sequences, particularly when new gene candidates are short. How well-suited is ASR as a tool for the detection and study of de novo genes? Here, we address this question by designing an ASR workflow incorporating different tools and sets of parameters and by introducing a formal criterion that allows to estimate, within a desired level of confidence, when protein-coding capacity originated at a particular locus. Applying this workflow on [~]2,600 short, annotated budding yeast genes (&lt;1,000 nucleotides), we found that ASR robustly predicts an ancient origin for most widely conserved genes, which constitute &#34;easy&#34; cases. For less robust cases, we calculated a randomization-based empirical P-value estimating whether the observed conservation between the extant and ancestral reading frame could be attributed to chance. This formal criterion allowed us to pinpoint a branch of origin for most of the less robust cases, identifying 33 genes that can unequivocally be considered de novo originated since the split of the Saccharomyces genus, including 20 S. cerevisiae-specific genes. We find that the remaining, equivocal cases, may be explained by different evolutionary scenarios including rapid evolution and multiple losses, as well as a very recent de novo origin. Overall, our findings suggest that ASR is a valuable tool to study de novo gene emergence but should be applied with caution and awareness of its limitations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species which are continually evolving within and across hosts. The ability to identify adaptations common to many host gut microbiomes would not only reveal shared selection pressures across hosts, but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, to date there has not been a systematic scan for adaptations that have spread across host microbiomes. Here, we develop a novel selection scan statistic, named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS), that can detect the spread of adaptive haplotypes across host microbiomes via migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with the beneficial variant, a common feature of adaptive evolution. We find that iLDS is capable of detecting simulated and known cases of selection, and moreover is robust to potential confounders that can also elevate LD. Application of the statistic to [~]20 common commensal gut species from a large cohort of healthy, Western adults reveals pervasive spread of selected alleles across human microbiomes mediated by horizontal gene transfer. Among the candidate selective sweeps recovered by iLDS is an enrichment for genes involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin, a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of Western diets. In summary, we demonstrate that selective sweeps across host microbiomes are a common feature of the evolution of the human gut microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pleiotropy, measured as expression breadth across tissues, is one of the best predictors for protein sequence and expression conservation. In this study, we investigated its effect on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). To this end, we carefully reanalyzed the Epigenomics Roadmap data for nine fetal tissues, assigning a measure of pleiotropic degree to nearly half a million CREs. To assess the functional conservation of CREs, we generated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from humans and macaques. We found that more pleiotropic CREs exhibit greater conservation in accessibility, and the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes are more conserved. This trend of higher conservation for higher degrees of pleiotropy persists when analyzing the transcription factor binding repertoire. In contrast, simple DNA sequence conservation of orthologous sites between species tends to be even lower for pleiotropic CREs than for species-specific CREs. Combining various lines of evidence, we suggest that the lack of sequence conservation for functionally conserved pleiotropic elements is due to compensatory evolution within these large pleiotropic CREs. Furthermore, for less pleiotropic CREs, we find an indication of compensation across CREs. This suggests that pleiotropy is also a good predictor for the functional conservation of CREs, but this is not reflected in the sequence conservation for pleiotropic CREs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Animals, and mammals in particular, vary widely in their &#34;pace of life,&#34; with some species living long lives and reproducing infrequently (slow life histories) and others living short lives and reproducing often (fast life histories). These species also vary in the importance of maternal care in offspring fitness: in some species, offspring are fully independent of their mothers following a brief period of nutritional input, while others display a long period of continued dependence on mothers well after nutritional dependence. Here we hypothesize that these two axes of variation are causally related to each other, such that extended dependence of offspring on maternal presence leads to the evolution of longer lives at the expense of reproduction. We use a combination of deterministic modeling and stochastic agent-based modeling to explore how empirically-observed links between maternal survival and offspring fitness are likely to shape the evolution of mortality and fertility. Each of our modelling approaches leads to the same conclusion: when maternal survival has strong impacts on the survival of offspring and grandoffspring, populations evolve longer lives with less frequent reproduction. Our results suggest the slow life histories of humans and other primates as well as other long-lived, highly social animals such as hyenas, whales, and elephants, are partially the result of the strong maternal care that these animals display. We have designed our models to be readily parameterized with demographic data that is routinely collected by long-term researchers, which will facilitate more thorough testing of our hypothesis.

Significance StatementHumans and other primates live longer lives and reproduce less often than other mammals of similar body mass. What is the cause of these long lives? Here we add to existing hypotheses, including the Mother and Grandmother hypotheses, by arguing that these increased lifespans are partially explained by the intense maternal care that many primates express. Using a combination of deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches, informed by empirical data, we show that stronger connections between maternal survival and offspring fitness leads to selection for longer lives and slower reproduction. Our models suggest that the importance of the mother-offspring relationship, which defines much of human and non-human primate lives, lies at the core of the evolution of our long lives.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Linking genes to traits is a central goal in biology. Despite progress in discovering genes associated with trait differences, a poor understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying genetic associations leaves us critically far from connecting genetic and phenotypic variation. This knowledge-gap is particularly large in multifaceted phenotypes of ecological relevance such as life-history traits. Using a multiomic dissection of the genotype-phenotype association in a large-effect maturation age gene - the transcription cofactor vestigial-like 3 (vgll3) - in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), we show that vgll3 mediates concerted changes of distinct molecular phenotypes associated with puberty in male gonads. Vgll3 genotype conferring early maturity upregulates key genes controlling androgen production, cellular energy and adiposity, and TGF-{beta} signaling, among others, thereby increasing the likelihood of earlier pubertal initiation. Genotype-dependent developmental trajectories are produced through VGLL3 interaction with distinct transcription factors, thus coordinating differential activation of regulatory pathways. These results reveal a genetically simple, yet functionally complex, architecture underlying alternative life-histories where variation in a single major effect gene produces pleiotropic variation in a spectrum of cellular traits. Our results further suggest that evolution in correlated phenotypes such as exemplified by alternative life history strategies may be mediated by a surprisingly simple genetic architecture.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gut microbes can impact cognition and behavior, but whether they regulate division of labor in animal societies is unknown. We addressed this question using honeybees since they exhibit division of labor between nurses and foragers and because their gut microbiota can be manipulated. Using automated behavioral tracking and controlling for co-housing effects, we show that gut microbes influence the age at which bees start foraging but have no effects on the time spent in a foraging area and number of foraging trips. Moreover, the gut microbiota did not influence hallmarks of behavioral maturation such as body weight, cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile, hypopharyngeal gland size, and the proportion of bees maturing into foragers. Overall, this study shows that the honeybee gut microbiota does not affect division of labor but rather plays an important function in controlling the onset of bee foraging.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Insects represent the most diverse animal group, yet previous phylogenetic analyses based on the morphological and molecular data have failed to agree on the evolutionary relationships of early insects and their six-legged relatives (together constituting the clade Hexapoda). In particular, the phylogenetic positions of the three early-diverging hexapod groups, the coneheads (Protura), springtails (Collembola), and two-pronged bristletails (Diplura), have been debated for over a century, with alternative topologies implying drastically different scenarios of the evolution of the insect body plan and hexapod terrestrialisation. We addressed this issue by sampling of all hexapod orders, and experimented with a broad range of across-site compositional heterogeneous models designed to tackle ancient divergences. Our analyses support Protura as the earliest-diverging hexapod lineage (Protura-sister) and Collembola as a sister group to the Diplura, a clade we refer to as  Antennomusculata characterised by the shared possession of internal muscles in the antennal flagellum. The universally recognized  Ellipura hypothesis is recovered under the site-homogenous LG model. Our cross-validation analysis shows that the CAT-GTR model that recovers Protura-sister fits significantly better than homogenous model. Furthermore, as a very unusual group, Protura as the first diverging lineage of hexapods is also supported by other lines of evidence, such as mitogenomics, comparative embryology, and sperm morphology. The backbone phylogeny of hexapods recovered in this study will facilitate the exploration of the underpinnings of hexapod terrestrialisation and mega-diversity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The maintenance of stable mating type polymorphisms is a classic example of balancing selection, underlying the nearly ubiquitous 50/50 sex ratio in species with separate sexes. One lesser known but intriguing example of a balanced mating polymorphism in angiosperms is heterodichogamy - polymorphism for opposing directions of dichogamy (temporal separation of male and female function in hermaphrodites) within a flowering season. This mating system is common throughout Juglandaceae, the family that includes globally important and iconic nut and timber crops - walnuts (Juglans), as well as pecan and other hickories (Carya). We show that two distinct genetic systems control heterodichogamous mating systems in these genera. In each genus, we find ancient (&gt;50Mya) structural variants that segregate as trans-species polymorphisms. The Juglans locus maps to a ca. 20kb structural variant adjacent to gene with likely function in the trehalose-6-phosphate signaling pathway, which is known to regulate flowering time in Arabidopsis and inflorescence architecture in maize. Notably, an insertion in the dominant (protogynous) haplotype contains 8-12 complex tandem duplicates of the 3 UTR of the gene, and transpecies polymorphism within the gene is restricted to the 3 UTR. In contrast, the Carya heterodichogamy locus maps to a ca. 200-450 kb cluster of tightly linked polymorphisms across 20 genes, some of which have known roles in flowering and are differentially expressed between morphs in floral primordia. The dominant (protogynous) haplotype in pecan, which is nearly always heterozygous and appears to rarely recombine, shows reduced genetic diversity and is over twice as long as its recessive counterpart due to proliferation of multiple transposable element families. We did not detect either genetic system in another heterodichogamous genus within the Juglandaceae, suggesting that additional genetic systems for heterodichogamy may yet remain undiscovered.</p>
