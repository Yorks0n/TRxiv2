E.\nScore: 28.5, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578004\nNeural crest (NC) is a vertebrate-specific embryonic progenitor cell population at the basis of important vertebrate features such as the craniofacial skeleton and pigmentation patterns. Despite the wide-ranging variation of NC-derived traits across vertebrates, the contribution of NC to species diversification remains largely unexplored. Here, by leveraging the adaptive diversity of African Great Lakes cichlid species, we combined comparative transcriptomics and population genomics to investigate the role of NC development in morphological diversification. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in transcriptional landscapes across somitogenesis, an embryonic period coinciding with NC development and migration. Notably, several NC-related gene expression clusters showed both species-specific divergence in transcriptional landscapes and signatures of positive selection. Specifically, we identified two paralogs of the sox10 gene as prime NC-related candidates contributing to interspecific morphological variation, which displayed remarkable spatio-temporal expression variation in cichlids. Finally, through CRISPR-KO mutants, we experimentally validated the functional divergence between sox10 paralogs, with the acquisition of a novel role in cichlid skeletogenesis by sox10-like. Our study demonstrates the central role of NC-related processes - in particular those controlled by sox10s - in generating morphological diversification among closely-related species and lays the groundwork for further investigations into the mechanisms underpinning vertebrate NC diversification.\nGelatinous matrix, an original convergent evolution to cope with oligotrophy in Nassellaria (Radiolaria)\nAuthors: Llopis Monferrer, N.; Romac, S.; Laget, M.; Biard, T.; Sandin, M. M.\nScore: 16.1, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576765\nRadiolaria are heterotrophic protists abundant in the worlds oceans playing important roles in oceanic biogeochemical cycles. Some species can host photosynthetic algae thus contributing to primary production. Such mixotrophic behaviour is believed to explain their ecological success in oligotrophic waters, notably Collodaria, a group of exclusively mixotrophic radiolarians embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Sampling oligotrophic California Current communities revealed an abundant, rarely observed population of Nassellaria of the genus Phlebarachnium, the only Radiolaria known to live within a gelatinous matrix besides Collodaria. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the ribosomal DNA suggests that these two distantly related lineages within Nassellaria independently developed the ability to produce a gelatinous matrix [~]120 million years ago. Molecular analyses identify photosynthetic symbionts as Scrippsiella sp., a common dinoflagellate symbiont of other planktonic groups. By matching our physical samples with their genetic signature, we identified these rarely observed organisms in global metabarcoding datasets, revealing a strong biogeographic affinity to oligotrophic water masses. Our results suggest that the gelatinous matrix is an exclusive adaptation to oligotrophic waters although further research is required to evaluate the similarities between the gelatinous matrices of Collodaria and Phlebarachnium. We hypothesize that such an original convergent evolution could increase the effective volume to weight ratio favoring prey contact and capture and provide an advantageous microenvironment for symbionts, enhancing ecological success in nutrient-depleted waters. This study advances our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic diversity and highlights the specific advantages of certain adaptations, specifically when evolution occurs independently among various lineages.\nParallel evolution in mosquito vectors - a duplicated esterase locus is associated with resistance to pirimiphos-methyl in An. gambiae\nAuthors: Nagi, S. C.; Lucas, E. R.; Egyir-Yawson, A.; Essandoh, J.; Dadzie, S.; Chabi, J.; Djogbenou, L. S.; Medjigbodo, A. A.; Edi, C. V.; Ketoh, G.; Koudou, B. G.; Ashraf, F.; Clarkson, C. S.; Miles, A.; Weetman, D.; Donnelly, M. J.\nScore: 14.0, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.01.578361\nThe primary control methods for the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, are based on insecticidal interventions. Emerging resistance to these compounds is therefore of major concern to malaria control programmes. The organophosphate, pirimiphos-methyl, is a relatively new chemical in the vector control armoury but is now widely used in indoor residual spray campaigns. Whilst generally effective, phenotypic resistance has developed in some areas in malaria vectors. Here, we used a population genomic approach to identify novel mechanisms of resistance to pirimiphos-methyl in Anopheles gambiae s.l mosquitoes. In multiple populations, we found large and repeated signals of selection at a locus containing a cluster of detoxification enzymes, some of whose orthologs are known to confer resistance to organophosphates in Culex pipiens. Close examination revealed a pair of alpha-esterases, Coeae1f and Coeae2f, and a complex and diverse pattern of haplotypes under selection in An. gambiae, An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis. As in Cx. pipiens, copy number variation seems to play a role in the evolution of insecticide resistance at this locus. We used diplotype clustering to examine whether these signals arise from parallel evolution or adaptive introgression. Using whole-genome sequenced phenotyped samples, we found that in West Africa, a copy number variant in Anopheles gambiae is associated with resistance to pirimiphos-methyl. Overall, we demonstrate a striking example of contemporary parallel evolution which has important implications for malaria control programmes.\nEvolutionary innovation in conserved regulatory elements across the mammalian tree of life\nAuthors: Uebbing, S.; Kocher, A.

P.\nScore: 8.4, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.31.578197\nTranscriptional enhancers orchestrate cell type- and time point-specific gene expression programs. Evolution of enhancer sequences can alter target gene expression without causing detrimental misexpression in other contexts. It has long been thought that this modularity allows evolutionary changes in enhancers to escape pleiotropic constraints, which is especially important for evolutionary constrained developmental patterning genes. However, there is still little data supporting this hypothesis. Here we identified signatures of accelerated evolution in conserved enhancer elements across the mammalian phylogeny. We found that pleiotropic genes involved in gene regulatory and developmental processes were enriched for accelerated sequence evolution within their enhancer elements. These genes were associated with an excess number of enhancers compared to other genes, and due to this they exhibit a substantial degree of sequence acceleration over all their enhancers combined. We provide evidence that sequence acceleration is associated with turnover of regulatory function. We studied one acceleration event in depth and found that its sequence evolution led to the emergence of a new enhancer activity domain that may be involved in the evolution of digit reduction in hoofed mammals. Our results provide tangible evidence that enhancer evolution has been a frequent contributor to modifications involving constrained developmental signaling genes in mammals.\nReproductive innovation enabled radiation in the deep sea during an ecological crisis\nAuthors: Brownstein, C.; Zapfe, K.; Lott, S.; Harrington, R. C.; Ghezelayagh, A.; Dornburg, A.; Near, T. J.\nScore: 115.3, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575380\nMajor ecological transitions are thought to fuel evolutionary radiations, but whether they are contingent on the evolution of certain traits is unclear. We show that the rapid ecological transition of anglerfishes into pelagic habitats during a period of major global warming coincided with the origins of sexual parasitism, in which male anglerfishes temporarily attach or permanently fuse to females to mate. A phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of anglerfishes provides a strong inference for the convergent evolution of permanently-fusing deep-sea anglerfishes and their degenerate immune genes. Our results support that sexual parasitism was enabled by the degeneration of adaptive immunity and ancestral sexual size dimorphism. The combination of these traits facilitated the transition of pelagic anglerfishes into novel ecologies available in the deep open oceans after evolving from benthic ancestors. These results show how seemingly unrelated physiological and reproductive traits interact synergistically to drive evolutionary radiation in novel environments.\nSex-biased migration and demographic history of the big European firefly Lampyris noctiluca\nAuthors: Catalan, A.; Gygax, D.; Candolin, U.; Tusso, S.; Duchen, P.; Hoehna, S.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2024-01-29 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.24.577017\nDifferential dispersion between the sexes can impact population structure and connectivity between populations, which in turn, can have an effect on the evolvability capability of a species. Here we explored the demographic history of the big European firefly, Lampyris noctiluca, which exhibits female neoteny. L. noctiluca distribution extends throughout Europe, but nothing is known on how its colonization processes. To investigate this, we produced the first Lampyris genome (653Mb), including an IsoSeq annotation and the identification of the X chromosome. We collected 115 individuals from six populations of L. noctiluca (Finland to Italy) and generated whole genome re-sequencing for each individual. We inferred several population expansions and bottlenecks throughout the Pleistocene that correlate with glaciation events. Surprisingly, we uncovered strong population structure and low gene-flow. We reject a stepwise, south to north, colonization history scenario and instead uncovered a complex demographic history with a putative eastern European origin. Analyzing the evolutionary history of the mitochondrial genome as well as X-linked and autosomal loci, we found evidence of a maternal colonialization of Germany, putatively from a western European population, followed by male-only migration from south of the Alps (Italy). Overall, investigating the demographic history and colonization patterns of a species should form part of an integrative approach of biodiversity research. Our results provide evidence of sex-biased migration which is important to consider for demographic, biogeographic and species delimitation studies.\nMultiple distinct evolutionary mechanisms govern the dynamics of selfish mitochondrial genomes\nAuthors: Gitschlag, B. L.; Pereira, C. V.; Held, J. P.; McCandlish, D. M.; Patel, M. R.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2022.04.08.487647\nCells possess multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies, which undergo semi-autonomous replication and stochastic inheritance. This enables mutant mtDNA variants to arise and selfishly compete with cooperative (wildtype) mtDNA. Selfish mitochondrial genomes are subject to selection at different levels: they compete against wildtype mtDNA directly within hosts and indirectly through organismal selection. However, determining the relative contributions of selection at different levels has proven challenging. We overcome this challenge by combining mathematical modeling with experiments designed to isolate the levels of selection. Applying this approach to many selfish mitochondrial genotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed an unexpected diversity of evolutionary mechanisms. Some mutant genomes persist at high frequency for many generations, despite a host fitness cost, by aggressively outcompeting cooperative genomes within hosts. Conversely, some mutant genomes persist by evading organismal selection. Strikingly, the mutant genomes vary dramatically in their susceptibility to neutral drift. Although different mechanisms can cause high frequency of selfish mtDNA, we show how they give rise to characteristically different distributions of mutant frequency among individuals. Given that heteroplasmic frequency represents a key determinant of phenotypic severity, this work outlines an evolutionary theoretic framework for predicting the distribution of phenotypic consequences among individuals carrying a selfish mitochondrial genome.\nComplex interactions in the life cycle of a simple parasite shape the evolution of virulence\nAuthors: Silva, L. M.; Koella, J. C.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2024-01-28 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577571\nEvolutionary expectations about the virulence of parasites (i.e. the parasite-induced mortality rate of the host) generally describe parasites which grow and are transmitted at the same time. Many parasites, however, go through an incubation period, that is they must grow before they can be transmitted. Moreover, the parasites incubation period and virulence are linked through its growth rate. We here suggest that such interactions make it difficult to predict how virulence will evolve. We illustrate our ideas with a parasite with a simple cycle, the microsporidian Vavraia culicis, which infects the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We selected the parasite for six generations to kill their host and be transmitted early or late. Selecting for late transmission led to a stronger increasing its exploitation (i.e., cost due to growth), but not pathogenicity per parasite (i.e., cost independent of growth), than selection for early transmission. This was associated with higher virulence, and a shorter parasite life cycle, with the latter having a larger and more rapid production of the infective spores. In response, the host shortened its life cycle and shifted to early fecundity when infected with late-selected spores. Altogether, the results of this study reinforce the need for a reviewed and unified virulence theory and raise important questions for epidemiological and vector control strategies. Significance statementIn evolutionary medicine, we commonly refer to the severity or outcome of a parasitic infection as the parasites virulence. The evolution of virulence is shaped by the properties of both the host and parasite, such as the strength of the hosts immune response or the production of toxins by the parasite. A fundamental property of the parasite is the time at which it is transmitted from one host to the next. Here, using the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis, we demonstrate that time to transmission directly affects the evolution of virulence and, therefore, the infection outcome in the new host. Our study highlights the importance of time to transmission in epidemiological models and decision-making in vector control strategies.\nThe distribution of fitness effects during adaptive walks using a simple genetic network\nAuthors: O'Brien, N. L. V.; Holland, B.; Engelstaedter, J.; Ortiz-Barrientos, D.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.26.564303\nThe tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles. Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability. However, the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. Using forward-time genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential. We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects.\nAdaptive and pleiotropic effects of evolution in synonymous sugar environments.\nAuthors: Ahlawat, N.; Venkataraman, P.; Mahilkar, A.; Brajesh, R. G.; Saini, S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577607\nAdaptation to an environment is enabled by the accumulation of beneficial mutations. When adapted populations are shifted to other environments, the byproduct or pleiotropic fitness effects of these mutations can be wide-ranged. Since there exists no molecular framework to quantify relatedness of environments, predicting pleiotropic effects based on adaptation has been challenging. In this work, we ask if evolution in highly similar environments elicits correlated adaptive and pleiotropic responses. We evolve replicate populations of Escherichia coli in non-stressful environments that contain either a mixture of glucose and galactose, lactose, or melibiose as the source of carbon. We term these similar sugars as \"synonymous\", since lactose and melibiose are disaccharides made up of glucose and galactose. Therefore, the evolution environments differed only in the way carbon was presented to the bacterial population. After 300 generations of evolution, we see that the adaptive responses of these populations are not predictable. We investigate the pleiotropic effects of adaptation in a range of non-synonymous environments, and show that despite uncorrelated adaptive changes, the nature of pleiotropic effects is largely predictable based on the fitness of the ancestor in the non-home environments. Overall, our results highlight how subtle changes in the environment can alter adaptation, but despite sequence-level variations, pleiotropy is qualitatively predictable.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Neural crest (NC) is a vertebrate-specific embryonic progenitor cell population at the basis of important vertebrate features such as the craniofacial skeleton and pigmentation patterns. Despite the wide-ranging variation of NC-derived traits across vertebrates, the contribution of NC to species diversification remains largely unexplored. Here, by leveraging the adaptive diversity of African Great Lakes cichlid species, we combined comparative transcriptomics and population genomics to investigate the role of NC development in morphological diversification. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in transcriptional landscapes across somitogenesis, an embryonic period coinciding with NC development and migration. Notably, several NC-related gene expression clusters showed both species-specific divergence in transcriptional landscapes and signatures of positive selection. Specifically, we identified two paralogs of the sox10 gene as prime NC-related candidates contributing to interspecific morphological variation, which displayed remarkable spatio-temporal expression variation in cichlids. Finally, through CRISPR-KO mutants, we experimentally validated the functional divergence between sox10 paralogs, with the acquisition of a novel role in cichlid skeletogenesis by sox10-like. Our study demonstrates the central role of NC-related processes - in particular those controlled by sox10s - in generating morphological diversification among closely-related species and lays the groundwork for further investigations into the mechanisms underpinning vertebrate NC diversification.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Radiolaria are heterotrophic protists abundant in the worlds oceans playing important roles in oceanic biogeochemical cycles. Some species can host photosynthetic algae thus contributing to primary production. Such mixotrophic behaviour is believed to explain their ecological success in oligotrophic waters, notably Collodaria, a group of exclusively mixotrophic radiolarians embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Sampling oligotrophic California Current communities revealed an abundant, rarely observed population of Nassellaria of the genus Phlebarachnium, the only Radiolaria known to live within a gelatinous matrix besides Collodaria. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the ribosomal DNA suggests that these two distantly related lineages within Nassellaria independently developed the ability to produce a gelatinous matrix [~]120 million years ago. Molecular analyses identify photosynthetic symbionts as Scrippsiella sp., a common dinoflagellate symbiont of other planktonic groups. By matching our physical samples with their genetic signature, we identified these rarely observed organisms in global metabarcoding datasets, revealing a strong biogeographic affinity to oligotrophic water masses. Our results suggest that the gelatinous matrix is an exclusive adaptation to oligotrophic waters although further research is required to evaluate the similarities between the gelatinous matrices of Collodaria and Phlebarachnium. We hypothesize that such an original convergent evolution could increase the effective volume to weight ratio favoring prey contact and capture and provide an advantageous microenvironment for symbionts, enhancing ecological success in nutrient-depleted waters. This study advances our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic diversity and highlights the specific advantages of certain adaptations, specifically when evolution occurs independently among various lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The primary control methods for the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, are based on insecticidal interventions. Emerging resistance to these compounds is therefore of major concern to malaria control programmes. The organophosphate, pirimiphos-methyl, is a relatively new chemical in the vector control armoury but is now widely used in indoor residual spray campaigns. Whilst generally effective, phenotypic resistance has developed in some areas in malaria vectors. Here, we used a population genomic approach to identify novel mechanisms of resistance to pirimiphos-methyl in Anopheles gambiae s.l mosquitoes. In multiple populations, we found large and repeated signals of selection at a locus containing a cluster of detoxification enzymes, some of whose orthologs are known to confer resistance to organophosphates in Culex pipiens. Close examination revealed a pair of alpha-esterases, Coeae1f and Coeae2f, and a complex and diverse pattern of haplotypes under selection in An. gambiae, An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis. As in Cx. pipiens, copy number variation seems to play a role in the evolution of insecticide resistance at this locus. We used diplotype clustering to examine whether these signals arise from parallel evolution or adaptive introgression. Using whole-genome sequenced phenotyped samples, we found that in West Africa, a copy number variant in Anopheles gambiae is associated with resistance to pirimiphos-methyl. Overall, we demonstrate a striking example of contemporary parallel evolution which has important implications for malaria control programmes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell type- and time point-specific gene expression programs. Evolution of enhancer sequences can alter target gene expression without causing detrimental misexpression in other contexts. It has long been thought that this modularity allows evolutionary changes in enhancers to escape pleiotropic constraints, which is especially important for evolutionary constrained developmental patterning genes. However, there is still little data supporting this hypothesis. Here we identified signatures of accelerated evolution in conserved enhancer elements across the mammalian phylogeny. We found that pleiotropic genes involved in gene regulatory and developmental processes were enriched for accelerated sequence evolution within their enhancer elements. These genes were associated with an excess number of enhancers compared to other genes, and due to this they exhibit a substantial degree of sequence acceleration over all their enhancers combined. We provide evidence that sequence acceleration is associated with turnover of regulatory function. We studied one acceleration event in depth and found that its sequence evolution led to the emergence of a new enhancer activity domain that may be involved in the evolution of digit reduction in hoofed mammals. Our results provide tangible evidence that enhancer evolution has been a frequent contributor to modifications involving constrained developmental signaling genes in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Major ecological transitions are thought to fuel evolutionary radiations, but whether they are contingent on the evolution of certain traits is unclear. We show that the rapid ecological transition of anglerfishes into pelagic habitats during a period of major global warming coincided with the origins of sexual parasitism, in which male anglerfishes temporarily attach or permanently fuse to females to mate. A phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of anglerfishes provides a strong inference for the convergent evolution of permanently-fusing deep-sea anglerfishes and their degenerate immune genes. Our results support that sexual parasitism was enabled by the degeneration of adaptive immunity and ancestral sexual size dimorphism. The combination of these traits facilitated the transition of pelagic anglerfishes into novel ecologies available in the deep open oceans after evolving from benthic ancestors. These results show how seemingly unrelated physiological and reproductive traits interact synergistically to drive evolutionary radiation in novel environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Differential dispersion between the sexes can impact population structure and connectivity between populations, which in turn, can have an effect on the evolvability capability of a species. Here we explored the demographic history of the big European firefly, Lampyris noctiluca, which exhibits female neoteny. L. noctiluca distribution extends throughout Europe, but nothing is known on how its colonization processes. To investigate this, we produced the first Lampyris genome (653Mb), including an IsoSeq annotation and the identification of the X chromosome. We collected 115 individuals from six populations of L. noctiluca (Finland to Italy) and generated whole genome re-sequencing for each individual. We inferred several population expansions and bottlenecks throughout the Pleistocene that correlate with glaciation events. Surprisingly, we uncovered strong population structure and low gene-flow. We reject a stepwise, south to north, colonization history scenario and instead uncovered a complex demographic history with a putative eastern European origin. Analyzing the evolutionary history of the mitochondrial genome as well as X-linked and autosomal loci, we found evidence of a maternal colonialization of Germany, putatively from a western European population, followed by male-only migration from south of the Alps (Italy). Overall, investigating the demographic history and colonization patterns of a species should form part of an integrative approach of biodiversity research. Our results provide evidence of sex-biased migration which is important to consider for demographic, biogeographic and species delimitation studies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cells possess multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copies, which undergo semi-autonomous replication and stochastic inheritance. This enables mutant mtDNA variants to arise and selfishly compete with cooperative (wildtype) mtDNA. Selfish mitochondrial genomes are subject to selection at different levels: they compete against wildtype mtDNA directly within hosts and indirectly through organismal selection. However, determining the relative contributions of selection at different levels has proven challenging. We overcome this challenge by combining mathematical modeling with experiments designed to isolate the levels of selection. Applying this approach to many selfish mitochondrial genotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans revealed an unexpected diversity of evolutionary mechanisms. Some mutant genomes persist at high frequency for many generations, despite a host fitness cost, by aggressively outcompeting cooperative genomes within hosts. Conversely, some mutant genomes persist by evading organismal selection. Strikingly, the mutant genomes vary dramatically in their susceptibility to neutral drift. Although different mechanisms can cause high frequency of selfish mtDNA, we show how they give rise to characteristically different distributions of mutant frequency among individuals. Given that heteroplasmic frequency represents a key determinant of phenotypic severity, this work outlines an evolutionary theoretic framework for predicting the distribution of phenotypic consequences among individuals carrying a selfish mitochondrial genome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Evolutionary expectations about the virulence of parasites (i.e. the parasite-induced mortality rate of the host) generally describe parasites which grow and are transmitted at the same time. Many parasites, however, go through an incubation period, that is they must grow before they can be transmitted. Moreover, the parasites incubation period and virulence are linked through its growth rate. We here suggest that such interactions make it difficult to predict how virulence will evolve. We illustrate our ideas with a parasite with a simple cycle, the microsporidian Vavraia culicis, which infects the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We selected the parasite for six generations to kill their host and be transmitted early or late. Selecting for late transmission led to a stronger increasing its exploitation (i.e., cost due to growth), but not pathogenicity per parasite (i.e., cost independent of growth), than selection for early transmission. This was associated with higher virulence, and a shorter parasite life cycle, with the latter having a larger and more rapid production of the infective spores. In response, the host shortened its life cycle and shifted to early fecundity when infected with late-selected spores. Altogether, the results of this study reinforce the need for a reviewed and unified virulence theory and raise important questions for epidemiological and vector control strategies.

Significance statementIn evolutionary medicine, we commonly refer to the severity or outcome of a parasitic infection as the parasites virulence. The evolution of virulence is shaped by the properties of both the host and parasite, such as the strength of the hosts immune response or the production of toxins by the parasite. A fundamental property of the parasite is the time at which it is transmitted from one host to the next. Here, using the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the microsporidian parasite Vavraia culicis, we demonstrate that time to transmission directly affects the evolution of virulence and, therefore, the infection outcome in the new host. Our study highlights the importance of time to transmission in epidemiological models and decision-making in vector control strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles. Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability. However, the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown. Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. Using forward-time genetic simulations, we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential. We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Adaptation to an environment is enabled by the accumulation of beneficial mutations. When adapted populations are shifted to other environments, the byproduct or pleiotropic fitness effects of these mutations can be wide-ranged. Since there exists no molecular framework to quantify relatedness of environments, predicting pleiotropic effects based on adaptation has been challenging. In this work, we ask if evolution in highly similar environments elicits correlated adaptive and pleiotropic responses. We evolve replicate populations of Escherichia coli in non-stressful environments that contain either a mixture of glucose and galactose, lactose, or melibiose as the source of carbon. We term these similar sugars as &#34;synonymous&#34;, since lactose and melibiose are disaccharides made up of glucose and galactose. Therefore, the evolution environments differed only in the way carbon was presented to the bacterial population. After 300 generations of evolution, we see that the adaptive responses of these populations are not predictable. We investigate the pleiotropic effects of adaptation in a range of non-synonymous environments, and show that despite uncorrelated adaptive changes, the nature of pleiotropic effects is largely predictable based on the fitness of the ancestor in the non-home environments. Overall, our results highlight how subtle changes in the environment can alter adaptation, but despite sequence-level variations, pleiotropy is qualitatively predictable.</p>
