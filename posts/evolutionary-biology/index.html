C.\nScore: 91.6, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566713\n\"Complex multicellularity\", conventionally defined as large organisms with many specialized cell types, has evolved five times independently in eukaryotes, but never within prokaryotes. A number hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, most of which posit that eukaryotes evolved key traits (e.g., dynamic cytoskeletons, alternative mechanisms of gene regulation, or subcellular compartments) which were a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of complex multicellularity. Here we propose an alternative, non-adaptive hypothesis for this broad macroevolutionary pattern. By binning cells into groups with finite genetic bottlenecks between generations, the evolution of multicellularity greatly reduces the effective population size (Ne) of cellular populations, increasing the role of genetic drift in evolutionary change. While both prokaryotes and eukaryotes experience this phenomenon, they have opposite responses to drift: mutational biases in eukaryotes tend to drive genomic expansion, providing additional raw genetic material for subsequent multicellular innovation, while prokaryotes generally face genomic erosion. These effects become more severe as organisms evolve larger size and more stringent genetic bottlenecks between generations-- both of which are hallmarks of complex multicellularity. Taken together, we hypothesize that it is these idiosyncratic lineagespecific mutational biases, rather than cell-biological innovations within eukaryotes, that underpins the long-term divergent evolution of complex multicellularity across the tree of life.\nTranslocations spur population growth but exacerbate inbreeding in an imperiled species\nAuthors: Linderoth, T.; Deaner, L.; Chen, N.; Bowman, R.; Boughton, R.; Fitzpatrick, S. W.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.11.566550\nLand and natural resource usage that supports human society can pose a risk to the survival of other species, spurring biodiversity loss. In extreme cases, when development threatens the existence of individuals, wildlife managers may perform mitigation translocations, relocating individuals out of harms way. We investigated the efficacy of mitigation translocations as a conservation strategy in Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jays using a dataset that provided unprecedented resolution into both the demographic and genomic outcomes of translocations. Over the course of seven years, a total of fourteen groups (51 jays) from five subpopulations that had been declining from agriculture and lack-of-fire driven habitat degradation were translocated to a larger site of more contiguous restored habitat with only four family groups, to mitigate for loss of these subpopulations from mining activity. Habitat restoration and translocations established a core population that increased 10-fold in size after only 17 years from the first translocations. Pedigree analyses of this population revealed that a small subset of mostly translocated individuals fueled the demographic expansion, with a single breeding pair responsible for [~]24% of the ancestral genetic contributions since 2008. Genomic comparisons between translocated individuals and individuals from the core population before and after translocations revealed that the high reproductive skew led to increased inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. This study stresses the importance of demographic and genetic monitoring following translocations, and that subsequent, genetic-rescue-oriented translocations may be necessary in mitigation scenarios to counter the genetic consequences of reproductive skew in fragmented populations. Significance StatementThere is ongoing debate surrounding the effectiveness of mitigation-driven translocations for conservation, however we show that translocations to mitigate the effects of mining on Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jays spurred population growth; a major boon to the viability of this species. We translocated individuals from at-risk subpopulations that were demographic sinks into recently restored habitat, which quickly established a rapidly growing core population. We demonstrate that demographic and genetic recovery do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, as reproduction was highly skewed towards a small subset of mostly translocated individuals, which increased inbreeding and eroded genetic diversity. This stresses the importance of demographic and genetic monitoring for identifying reproductive skew, allowing for adaptive management that addresses inbreeding and achieves broader conservation goals.\nInference of the demographic histories and selective effects of human gut commensal microbiota over the course of human history\nAuthors: Mah, J. C.; Lohmueller, K. E.; Garud, N.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-11-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.09.566454\nDespite the importance of gut commensal microbiota to human health, there is little knowledge about their evolutionary histories, including their population demographic histories and their distributions of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations. Here, we infer the demographic histories and DFEs of 27 of the most highly prevalent and abundant commensal gut microbial species in North Americans over timescales exceeding human generations using a collection of lineages inferred from a panel of healthy hosts. We find overall reductions in genetic variation among commensal gut microbes sampled from a Western population relative to an African rural population. Additionally, some species in North American microbiomes display contractions in population size and others expansions, potentially occurring at several key historical moments in human history. DFEs across species vary from highly to mildly deleterious, with accessory genes experiencing more drift compared to core genes. Within genera, DFEs tend to be more congruent, reflective of underlying phylogenetic relationships. Taken together, these findings suggest that human commensal gut microbes have distinct evolutionary histories, possibly reflecting the unique roles of individual members of the microbiome.\nIdiosyncrasies unveiled: examining the pace, patterns and predictors of biotic diversification in peninsular India\nAuthors: Roy, P.; Joshi, J.\nScore: 12.6, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567174\nUnderstanding the tempo and mode of diversification and their consequence for tropical biodiversity remains a key challenge as different clades and regions exemplify distinct patterns and processes. We examined diversification rates and their drivers across 34 well-studied endemic lineages in peninsular India, one of the oldest regions of differentiation in the Oriental Realm, using birth-death models and their variations. We show that 18 lineages supported gradual species accumulation, suggesting that the historic stability of the landscape was an important driver. Additionally, paleotemperature, Miocene aridification, monsoon intensification and existing species diversity explained time-varying diversification patterns among the other 16 lineages. Net-diversification rates influenced differences in species diversity more than clade ages of peninsular Indian clades, where speciation rates mainly drove diversification, as extinction rates were low across taxa. Our results emphasise the importance of regional biogeographic, phylogenetic and geoclimatic history on the diversification dynamics among tropical landscapes.\nMatreex: compact and interactive visualisation for scalable studies of large gene families\nAuthors: Rossier, V.; Train, C.; Nevers, Y.; Robinson-Rechavi, M.; Dessimoz, C.\nScore: 25.7, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.02.18.529053\nStudying gene family evolution strongly benefits from insightful visualisations. However, the evergrowing number of sequenced genomes is leading to increasingly larger gene families, which challenges existing gene tree visualisations. Indeed, most of them present users with a dilemma: display complete but intractable gene trees, or collapse subtrees, thereby hiding their childrens information. Here, we introduce Matreex, a new dynamic tool to scale-up the visualisation of gene families. Matreexs key idea is to use \"phylogenetic\" profiles, which are dense representations of gene repertoires, to minimise the information loss when collapsing subtrees. We illustrate Matreex usefulness with three biological applications. First, we demonstrate on the MutS family the power of combining gene trees and phylogenetic profiles to delve into precise evolutionary analyses of large multi-copy gene families. Secondly, by displaying 22 intraflagellar transport gene families across 622 species cumulating 5500 representatives, we show how Matreex can be used to automate large-scale analyses of gene presence-absence. Notably, we report for the first time the complete loss of intraflagellar transport in the myxozoan Thelohanellus kitauei. Finally, using the textbook example of visual opsins, we show Matreexs potential to create easily interpretable figures for teaching and outreach. Matreex is available from the Python Package Index (pip install matreex) with the source code and documentation available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/matreex.\nLittle Evidence for Homoeologous Gene Conversion and Homoeologous Exchange Events in Gossypium Allopolyploids\nAuthors: Conover, J. L.; Grover, C. E.; Sharbrough, J.; Sloan, D.; Peterson, D. G.; Wendel, J.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2023-11-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.08.566278\nA complicating factor in analyzing allopolyploid genomes is the possibility of physical interactions between homoeologous chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in either crossover (homoeologous exchanges) or non-crossover products (homoeologous gene conversion). This latter process was first described in cotton by comparing SNP patterns in sequences from two diploid progenitors with those from the allopolyploid subgenomes. These analyses, however, did not explicitly account for autapomorphic SNPs that may lead to similar patterns as homoeologous gene conversion, creating uncertainties about the reality of the inferred gene conversion events. Here, we use an expanded phylogenetic sampling of high-quality genome assemblies from seven allopolyploid Gossypium species (all derived from the same polyploidy event), four diploid species (two closely related to each subgenome), and a diploid outgroup to derive a robust method for identifying potential genomic regions of gene conversion and homoeologous exchange. Using this new method, we find little evidence for homoeologous gene conversion in allopolyploid cottons and that only two of the forty best-supported events are shared by more than one species. We do, however, reveal a single, shared homoeologous exchange event at one end of chromosome 1, which occurred shortly after allopolyploidization but prior to divergence of the descendant species. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that homoeologous gene conversion and homoeologous exchanges are uncommon in Gossypium, affecting between zero and 24 genes per subgenome (0.0 - 0.065%) across the seven species. More generally, we highlight the potential problems of using simple four-taxon tests to investigate patterns of homoeologous gene conversion in established allopolyploids. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAllopolyploidy is a prominent process in plant diversification, involving the union of two divergent genomes in a single nucleus via interspecific hybridization and genome doubling. The merger of genomes sets in motion a variety of inter-genomic and epigenomic interactions that are thought to lead to the origin of new phenotypes. Among these is recombinational exchange between duplicated chromosomes, which can involve sequence lengths ranging from several bases to entire chromosome arms, and which can be either reciprocal or unidirectional in their effects. Here we present a new analytical framework for detecting these inter-genomic recombinational processes in allopolyploids, and demonstrate that they have been rare in a group of allopolyploid species in the cotton genus.\nPromoter capture drives the emergence of proto-genes in Escherichia coli\nAuthors: uz-Zaman, M. H.; D'Alton, S.; Barrick, J. E.; Ochman, H.\nScore: 7.9, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567300\nThe phenomenon of de novo gene birth - the emergence of genes from non-genic sequences - has received considerable attention due to the widespread occurrence of genes that are unique to particular species or genomes. Most instances of de novo gene birth have been recognized through comparative analyses of genome sequences in eukaryotes, despite the abundance of novel, lineage-specific genes in bacteria and the relative ease with which bacteria can be studied in an experimental context. Here, we explore the genetic record of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) for changes indicative of \"proto-genic\" phases of new gene birth in which nongenic sequences evolve stable transcription and/or translation. Over the time span of the LTEE, non-genic regions are frequently transcribed, translated and differentially expressed, thereby serving as raw material for new gene emergence. Most proto-genes result either from insertion element activity or chromosomal translocations that fused pre-existing regulatory sequences to regions that were not expressed in the LTEE ancestor. Additionally, we identified instances of proto gene emergence in which a previously unexpressed sequence was transcribed after formation of an upstream promoter. Tracing the origin of the causative mutations, we discovered that most occurred early in the history of the LTEE, often within the first 20,000 generations, and became fixed soon after emergence. Our findings show that proto-genes emerge frequently within evolving populations, persist stably, and can serve as potential substrates for new gene formation.\nEvolutionarily new genes in humans with disease phenotypes reveal functional enrichment patterns shaped by adaptive innovation and sexual selection.\nAuthors: Chen, J.; Arsala, D.; Xia, S.; Atlas, J.; Sosa, D.; Guzzetta, A.; Dong, C.; Shen, B.; Cheng, J.; Zhang, Y.; Long, M.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-11-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.14.567139\nNew genes (or young genes) are structural novelties pivotal in mammalian evolution. Their phenotypic impact on humans, however, remains elusive due to the technical and ethical complexities in functional studies. Through combining gene age dating with Mendelian disease phenotyping, our research reveals that new genes associated with disease phenotypes steadily integrate into the human genome at a rate of ~0.07% every million years over macro-evolutionary timescales. Despite this stable pace, we observe distinct patterns in phenotypic enrichment, pleiotropy, and selective pressures between young and old genes. Notably, young genes show significant enrichment in the male reproductive system, indicating strong sexual selection. Young genes also exhibit functions in tissues and systems potentially linked to human phenotypic innovations, such as increased brain size, bipedal locomotion, and color vision. Our findings further reveal increasing levels of pleiotropy over evolutionary time, which accompanies stronger selective constraints. We propose a pleiotropy-barrier model that delineates different potentials for phenotypic innovation between young and older genes subject to natural selection. Our study demonstrates that evolutionary new genes are critical in influencing human reproductive evolution and adaptive phenotypic innovations driven by sexual and natural selection, with low pleiotropy as a selective advantage.\nHot springs viruses at Yellowstone National Park have ancient origins and are adapted to their thermophilic hosts.\nAuthors: Benites, L. F.; Stephens, T. G.; Van Etten, J.; James, T.; Christian, W. C.; Barry, K.; Grigoriev, I. V.; McDermott, T. R.; Bhattacharya, D.\nScore: 5.4, Published: 2023-11-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.15.567249\nGeothermal springs in areas such as Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA house unicellular red algae that dominate the microbial biomass. Little is known about the viruses that infect the biota. Here we used metagenomics to characterize the multi-kingdom infecting virus community associated with red algal mats in three neighboring habitats (creek, endolithic, soil) at Lemonade Creek, YNP to determine their taxonomic composition, predicted gene functions, extent of horizontal gene transfer, and potential links to hosts. We find that despite proximity, each habitat houses a unique collection of viruses, with the giant viruses, Megaviricetes, dominant in all three. The early branching phylogenetic position of genes encoded on metagenome assembled virus genomes (vMAGs) suggests that the YNP lineages are of ancient origins and not the result of multiple invasions from mesophilic habitats. The existence of genomic footprints of adaptation to thermophily in the vMAGs is consistent with this idea. Our study is the first analysis of viruses associated with polyextremophilic red algae that form extensive microbial mats in YNP and are common worldwide at geothermal sites. Although more recent than the earliest forms of prokaryotic life, these eukaryotic algal mats originated ca. 1.5 Bya, and therefore span a significant period of the planet history. Our data are therefore relevant to understanding biotic interactions on the early Earth.\nLong-term cold adaptation leads to increased thermal plasticity of male body size and thermal canalization of fecundity in populations of Drosophila melanogaster: an experimental evolution study\nAuthors: Roy, R.; Chattopadhyay, A.; Deb Sharma, S.; Mondal, A.; Biswas, P.; Ghosh, S. M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566815\nFrom laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 25{degrees}C for decades, new populations were derived and maintained at 17{degrees}C for about 60 generations. Fitness traits such as body size and fecundity of the cold and warm evolved populations were measured at both 17{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C. Flies from both selection regimes had similar body weight when grown at 25{degrees}C, but 17{degrees}C selected males had greater dry weight and less relative water content than 25{degrees}C selected males when grown at 17{degrees}C. This showed greater thermal plasticity of body weight and density in cold evolved males compared to controls. Fecundity data revealed, 25{degrees}C selected females laid less eggs at 17{degrees}C compared to 25{degrees}C treatment, but 17{degrees}C selected females did not show significant difference in fecundity between 25{degrees}C and 17{degrees}C. Cold selected females thus evolved thermal canalization of fecundity, buffering the repressing effect of cold. Whether or not the greater fitness of cold evolved (a) males, evident from their greater body mass and density, and (b) females, in terms of their unrepressed fecundity, at cold, are causally related remains to be seen. The study thus shows thermal selection can lead to increased thermal plasticity for a trait while result in thermal canalization of another.\n",

        <p class="abstract">&#34;Complex multicellularity&#34;, conventionally defined as large organisms with many specialized cell types, has evolved five times independently in eukaryotes, but never within prokaryotes. A number hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, most of which posit that eukaryotes evolved key traits (e.g., dynamic cytoskeletons, alternative mechanisms of gene regulation, or subcellular compartments) which were a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of complex multicellularity. Here we propose an alternative, non-adaptive hypothesis for this broad macroevolutionary pattern. By binning cells into groups with finite genetic bottlenecks between generations, the evolution of multicellularity greatly reduces the effective population size (Ne) of cellular populations, increasing the role of genetic drift in evolutionary change. While both prokaryotes and eukaryotes experience this phenomenon, they have opposite responses to drift: mutational biases in eukaryotes tend to drive genomic expansion, providing additional raw genetic material for subsequent multicellular innovation, while prokaryotes generally face genomic erosion. These effects become more severe as organisms evolve larger size and more stringent genetic bottlenecks between generations-- both of which are hallmarks of complex multicellularity. Taken together, we hypothesize that it is these idiosyncratic lineagespecific mutational biases, rather than cell-biological innovations within eukaryotes, that underpins the long-term divergent evolution of complex multicellularity across the tree of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Land and natural resource usage that supports human society can pose a risk to the survival of other species, spurring biodiversity loss. In extreme cases, when development threatens the existence of individuals, wildlife managers may perform mitigation translocations, relocating individuals out of harms way. We investigated the efficacy of mitigation translocations as a conservation strategy in Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jays using a dataset that provided unprecedented resolution into both the demographic and genomic outcomes of translocations. Over the course of seven years, a total of fourteen groups (51 jays) from five subpopulations that had been declining from agriculture and lack-of-fire driven habitat degradation were translocated to a larger site of more contiguous restored habitat with only four family groups, to mitigate for loss of these subpopulations from mining activity. Habitat restoration and translocations established a core population that increased 10-fold in size after only 17 years from the first translocations. Pedigree analyses of this population revealed that a small subset of mostly translocated individuals fueled the demographic expansion, with a single breeding pair responsible for [~]24% of the ancestral genetic contributions since 2008. Genomic comparisons between translocated individuals and individuals from the core population before and after translocations revealed that the high reproductive skew led to increased inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. This study stresses the importance of demographic and genetic monitoring following translocations, and that subsequent, genetic-rescue-oriented translocations may be necessary in mitigation scenarios to counter the genetic consequences of reproductive skew in fragmented populations.

Significance StatementThere is ongoing debate surrounding the effectiveness of mitigation-driven translocations for conservation, however we show that translocations to mitigate the effects of mining on Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jays spurred population growth; a major boon to the viability of this species. We translocated individuals from at-risk subpopulations that were demographic sinks into recently restored habitat, which quickly established a rapidly growing core population. We demonstrate that demographic and genetic recovery do not necessarily go hand-in-hand, as reproduction was highly skewed towards a small subset of mostly translocated individuals, which increased inbreeding and eroded genetic diversity. This stresses the importance of demographic and genetic monitoring for identifying reproductive skew, allowing for adaptive management that addresses inbreeding and achieves broader conservation goals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the importance of gut commensal microbiota to human health, there is little knowledge about their evolutionary histories, including their population demographic histories and their distributions of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations. Here, we infer the demographic histories and DFEs of 27 of the most highly prevalent and abundant commensal gut microbial species in North Americans over timescales exceeding human generations using a collection of lineages inferred from a panel of healthy hosts. We find overall reductions in genetic variation among commensal gut microbes sampled from a Western population relative to an African rural population. Additionally, some species in North American microbiomes display contractions in population size and others expansions, potentially occurring at several key historical moments in human history. DFEs across species vary from highly to mildly deleterious, with accessory genes experiencing more drift compared to core genes. Within genera, DFEs tend to be more congruent, reflective of underlying phylogenetic relationships. Taken together, these findings suggest that human commensal gut microbes have distinct evolutionary histories, possibly reflecting the unique roles of individual members of the microbiome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Understanding the tempo and mode of diversification and their consequence for tropical biodiversity remains a key challenge as different clades and regions exemplify distinct patterns and processes. We examined diversification rates and their drivers across 34 well-studied endemic lineages in peninsular India, one of the oldest regions of differentiation in the Oriental Realm, using birth-death models and their variations. We show that 18 lineages supported gradual species accumulation, suggesting that the historic stability of the landscape was an important driver. Additionally, paleotemperature, Miocene aridification, monsoon intensification and existing species diversity explained time-varying diversification patterns among the other 16 lineages. Net-diversification rates influenced differences in species diversity more than clade ages of peninsular Indian clades, where speciation rates mainly drove diversification, as extinction rates were low across taxa. Our results emphasise the importance of regional biogeographic, phylogenetic and geoclimatic history on the diversification dynamics among tropical landscapes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Studying gene family evolution strongly benefits from insightful visualisations. However, the evergrowing number of sequenced genomes is leading to increasingly larger gene families, which challenges existing gene tree visualisations. Indeed, most of them present users with a dilemma: display complete but intractable gene trees, or collapse subtrees, thereby hiding their childrens information. Here, we introduce Matreex, a new dynamic tool to scale-up the visualisation of gene families. Matreexs key idea is to use &#34;phylogenetic&#34; profiles, which are dense representations of gene repertoires, to minimise the information loss when collapsing subtrees. We illustrate Matreex usefulness with three biological applications. First, we demonstrate on the MutS family the power of combining gene trees and phylogenetic profiles to delve into precise evolutionary analyses of large multi-copy gene families. Secondly, by displaying 22 intraflagellar transport gene families across 622 species cumulating 5500 representatives, we show how Matreex can be used to automate large-scale analyses of gene presence-absence. Notably, we report for the first time the complete loss of intraflagellar transport in the myxozoan Thelohanellus kitauei. Finally, using the textbook example of visual opsins, we show Matreexs potential to create easily interpretable figures for teaching and outreach. Matreex is available from the Python Package Index (pip install matreex) with the source code and documentation available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/matreex.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A complicating factor in analyzing allopolyploid genomes is the possibility of physical interactions between homoeologous chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in either crossover (homoeologous exchanges) or non-crossover products (homoeologous gene conversion). This latter process was first described in cotton by comparing SNP patterns in sequences from two diploid progenitors with those from the allopolyploid subgenomes. These analyses, however, did not explicitly account for autapomorphic SNPs that may lead to similar patterns as homoeologous gene conversion, creating uncertainties about the reality of the inferred gene conversion events. Here, we use an expanded phylogenetic sampling of high-quality genome assemblies from seven allopolyploid Gossypium species (all derived from the same polyploidy event), four diploid species (two closely related to each subgenome), and a diploid outgroup to derive a robust method for identifying potential genomic regions of gene conversion and homoeologous exchange. Using this new method, we find little evidence for homoeologous gene conversion in allopolyploid cottons and that only two of the forty best-supported events are shared by more than one species. We do, however, reveal a single, shared homoeologous exchange event at one end of chromosome 1, which occurred shortly after allopolyploidization but prior to divergence of the descendant species. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that homoeologous gene conversion and homoeologous exchanges are uncommon in Gossypium, affecting between zero and 24 genes per subgenome (0.0 - 0.065%) across the seven species. More generally, we highlight the potential problems of using simple four-taxon tests to investigate patterns of homoeologous gene conversion in established allopolyploids.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAllopolyploidy is a prominent process in plant diversification, involving the union of two divergent genomes in a single nucleus via interspecific hybridization and genome doubling. The merger of genomes sets in motion a variety of inter-genomic and epigenomic interactions that are thought to lead to the origin of new phenotypes. Among these is recombinational exchange between duplicated chromosomes, which can involve sequence lengths ranging from several bases to entire chromosome arms, and which can be either reciprocal or unidirectional in their effects. Here we present a new analytical framework for detecting these inter-genomic recombinational processes in allopolyploids, and demonstrate that they have been rare in a group of allopolyploid species in the cotton genus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The phenomenon of de novo gene birth - the emergence of genes from non-genic sequences - has received considerable attention due to the widespread occurrence of genes that are unique to particular species or genomes. Most instances of de novo gene birth have been recognized through comparative analyses of genome sequences in eukaryotes, despite the abundance of novel, lineage-specific genes in bacteria and the relative ease with which bacteria can be studied in an experimental context. Here, we explore the genetic record of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) for changes indicative of &#34;proto-genic&#34; phases of new gene birth in which nongenic sequences evolve stable transcription and/or translation. Over the time span of the LTEE, non-genic regions are frequently transcribed, translated and differentially expressed, thereby serving as raw material for new gene emergence. Most proto-genes result either from insertion element activity or chromosomal translocations that fused pre-existing regulatory sequences to regions that were not expressed in the LTEE ancestor. Additionally, we identified instances of proto gene emergence in which a previously unexpressed sequence was transcribed after formation of an upstream promoter. Tracing the origin of the causative mutations, we discovered that most occurred early in the history of the LTEE, often within the first 20,000 generations, and became fixed soon after emergence. Our findings show that proto-genes emerge frequently within evolving populations, persist stably, and can serve as potential substrates for new gene formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">New genes (or young genes) are structural novelties pivotal in mammalian evolution. Their phenotypic impact on humans, however, remains elusive due to the technical and ethical complexities in functional studies. Through combining gene age dating with Mendelian disease phenotyping, our research reveals that new genes associated with disease phenotypes steadily integrate into the human genome at a rate of ~0.07% every million years over macro-evolutionary timescales. Despite this stable pace, we observe distinct patterns in phenotypic enrichment, pleiotropy, and selective pressures between young and old genes. Notably, young genes show significant enrichment in the male reproductive system, indicating strong sexual selection. Young genes also exhibit functions in tissues and systems potentially linked to human phenotypic innovations, such as increased brain size, bipedal locomotion, and color vision. Our findings further reveal increasing levels of pleiotropy over evolutionary time, which accompanies stronger selective constraints. We propose a pleiotropy-barrier model that delineates different potentials for phenotypic innovation between young and older genes subject to natural selection. Our study demonstrates that evolutionary new genes are critical in influencing human reproductive evolution and adaptive phenotypic innovations driven by sexual and natural selection, with low pleiotropy as a selective advantage.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Geothermal springs in areas such as Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA house unicellular red algae that dominate the microbial biomass. Little is known about the viruses that infect the biota. Here we used metagenomics to characterize the multi-kingdom infecting virus community associated with red algal mats in three neighboring habitats (creek, endolithic, soil) at Lemonade Creek, YNP to determine their taxonomic composition, predicted gene functions, extent of horizontal gene transfer, and potential links to hosts. We find that despite proximity, each habitat houses a unique collection of viruses, with the giant viruses, Megaviricetes, dominant in all three. The early branching phylogenetic position of genes encoded on metagenome assembled virus genomes (vMAGs) suggests that the YNP lineages are of ancient origins and not the result of multiple invasions from mesophilic habitats. The existence of genomic footprints of adaptation to thermophily in the vMAGs is consistent with this idea. Our study is the first analysis of viruses associated with polyextremophilic red algae that form extensive microbial mats in YNP and are common worldwide at geothermal sites. Although more recent than the earliest forms of prokaryotic life, these eukaryotic algal mats originated ca. 1.5 Bya, and therefore span a significant period of the planet history. Our data are therefore relevant to understanding biotic interactions on the early Earth.</p>

        <p class="abstract">From laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 25{degrees}C for decades, new populations were derived and maintained at 17{degrees}C for about 60 generations. Fitness traits such as body size and fecundity of the cold and warm evolved populations were measured at both 17{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C. Flies from both selection regimes had similar body weight when grown at 25{degrees}C, but 17{degrees}C selected males had greater dry weight and less relative water content than 25{degrees}C selected males when grown at 17{degrees}C. This showed greater thermal plasticity of body weight and density in cold evolved males compared to controls. Fecundity data revealed, 25{degrees}C selected females laid less eggs at 17{degrees}C compared to 25{degrees}C treatment, but 17{degrees}C selected females did not show significant difference in fecundity between 25{degrees}C and 17{degrees}C. Cold selected females thus evolved thermal canalization of fecundity, buffering the repressing effect of cold. Whether or not the greater fitness of cold evolved (a) males, evident from their greater body mass and density, and (b) females, in terms of their unrepressed fecundity, at cold, are causally related remains to be seen. The study thus shows thermal selection can lead to increased thermal plasticity for a trait while result in thermal canalization of another.</p>
