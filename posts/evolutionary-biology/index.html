Even after the loss of male individuals, males can survive on the genomes; in fact, rarely occurring males were described in many asexual lineages. Theoretical predictions suggest that genes related to male sexual traits in parthenogenetic lineages will decay over long evolutionary times free from the pressure of stabilizing selection. However, in many cases, such rare males are potentially functional. In this study, we investigated the functionality of rare males in the Japanese parthenogenetic stick insect, Ramulus mikado. Rarely occurring males in the species exhibited the external and anatomical morphology typical in stick insect males, and vigorously and successfully performed mating behaviors with conspecific females; nevertheless, no paternal genotypes were detected in the offspring; all embryos were genetically identical to their mothers. Our histological observation demonstrated that females received a spermatophore without sperms in their copulatory pouch, and revealed that in a male, spermatogenesis was completely deformed. These results suggest the irreversible clonal reproduction of R. mikado due to compromised male function. Our present study provides the first case of evident dysfunction in rare males of stick insects, illuminating the degenerative evolution of sexual traits in asexual lineages.\nEmergence and spread of the barley net blotch pathogen coincided with crop domestication and cultivation history\nAuthors: Taliadoros, D.; Feurtey, A.; Wyatt, N.; Gladieux, P.; Friesen, T.; Stukenbrock, E. H.\nScore: 13.5, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550921\nFungal pathogens cause devastating disease in crops. Understanding the evolutionary origin of pathogens is essential to the prediction of future disease emergence and the potential of pathogens to disperse. The fungus Pyrenophora teres f. teres causes net form net blotch (NFNB), an economically significant disease of barley. In this study, we have used 104 P. teres f. teres genomes from four continents to explore the population structure and demographic history of the fungal pathogen. We showed that P. teres f. teres is structured into populations that tend to be geographically restricted to different regions. Using Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent and machine learning approaches we demonstrated that the demographic history of the pathogen correlates with the history of barley, highlighting the importance of human migration and trade in spreading the pathogen. Exploring signatures of natural selection, we identified several population-specific selective sweeps that colocalized with genomic regions enriched in putative virulence genes, and loci previously identified as determinants of virulence specificities by quantitative trait locus analyses. This reflects rapid adaptation to local hosts and environmental conditions of P. teres f. teres as it spread with barley. Our research highlights how human activities can contribute to the spread of pathogens that significantly impact the productivity of field crops.\nLocal adaptation to an altitudinal gradient: the interplay between constitutive trait variation and phenotypic plasticity in Mimulus laciniatus\nAuthors: Syrotchen, J. M.; Ferris, K. G.\nScore: 11.6, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551729\nOrganisms can adapt to environmental heterogeneity through two mechanisms: (1) constitutive expression of population genetic variation or (2) phenotypic plasticity. We investigated whether patterns of plastic and constitutively expressed traits along elevational and latitudinal clines in a North American endemic plant, Mimulus laciniatus, were consistent with local adaptation. We grew inbred lines of M. laciniatus from across the species range to measure constitutive and plastic trait expression in several traits previously shown to be involved in adaptation to M. laciniatuss rocky outcrop microhabitat: flowering time, size-related traits, and leaf shape. We then tested for a relationship between variation in trait expression and population elevation and latitude, and examined correlation in trait expression between plastic and constitutive traits. We found that population variation in constitutive leaf lobing is associated with latitude, and identified multiple traits that show patterns consistent with local adaptation to elevation: critical photoperiod, flowering time, flower size, leaf lobing, and leaf lobing plasticity. These trends occur along multiple geographically independent altitudinal clines indicating that selection is a more likely cause of this pattern than gene flow among nearby populations with similar trait values. We did not find a correlation between constitutive and plastic leaf lobing at the individual genotype level, suggesting that while both traits appear to be adaptive, they operate under independent genetic controls. This indicates that both having more highly lobed leaves and greater leaf shape plasticity are likely adaptive at high elevation within M. laciniatus. Our data strongly suggest that traits known to be under divergent selection between M. laciniatus and close relative Mimulus guttatus are also under locally varying selection within M. laciniatus.\nDevelopmental noise and phenotypic plasticity are correlated in Drosophila simulans\nAuthors: Saito, K.; Tsuboi, M.; Takahashi, Y.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.550919\nNon-genetic variation is the phenotypic variation induced by the differential expression of a genotype in response to varying environmental cues and is broadly categorized into two types: phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise. These variation aspects have been suggested to play an important role in adaptive evolution; however, the mechanisms by which these two types of non-genetic variations influence the evolutionary process are currently poorly understood. Using a machine-learning based phenotyping tool, we independently quantified the phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in the wing morphological traits of a fruit fly Drosophila simulans. Utilizing a rearing experiment, we demonstrated plastic responses in both wing size and shape as well as non-zero heritability of both phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, which suggests that adaptive phenotypic plasticity can evolve via genetic accommodation in the wing morphology of D. simulans. We found a positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, while the correlation between the plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors that were examined (nutrient condition, temperature, and light-dark cycle) were poor. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise contribute to evolvability in a similar manner, however, the mechanisms that underlie the correspondence between these two variation types remains to be elucidated. Lay SummaryNon-genetic variations consist of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, and these variations have been suggested to influence the direction and the rate of evolution. However, the role of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in evolutionary process is still poorly understood. Using a rearing experiment, we examined the heritability of plasticity and developmental noise, the correlation of the strength of plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors, and the relationship between plasticity and developmental noise in wing size and wing shape in Drosophila simulans. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise were heritable, and positively correlated with each other. Our results suggest that there two non-genetic variations dependently affect the direction and the rate of evolution together.\nDeep estimation of the intensity and timing of selection from ancient genomes\nAuthors: Laval, G.; Patin, E.; Quintana-Murci, L.; Kerner, G.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550703\nLeveraging past allele frequencies has proven to be key to identify the impact of natural selection across time. However, this approach often suffers from imprecise estimations of the intensity (s) and timing (T) of selection particularly when ancient samples are scarce in specific epochs. Here, we aimed at bypassing the computation of past allele frequencies by implementing new convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithms that directly use ancient genotypes sampled across time to refine the estimations of selection parameters. Using computer simulations, we first show that genotype-based CNNs consistently outperform an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach based on past allele frequency trajectories, regardless of the selection model assumed and of the amount of ancient genotypes available. When applying this method to empirical data from modern and ancient Europeans, we confirmed the reported excess of selection events in post-Neolithic Europe, independently of the continental subregion studied. Furthermore, we substantially refined the ABC-based estimations of s and T for a set of positively-and negatively-selected variants recently identified, including iconic cases of positive selection and experimentally validated disease-risk variants. Thanks to our CNN predictions we provide support to the history of recent and strong selection in northern Europe associated to the Black Death pandemic and confirm the heavy burden recently imposed by tuberculosis in Europe. These findings collectively support that detecting the imprints of natural selection on ancient genomes are crucial for unraveling the past history of severe human diseases.\nFunctional Adaptations of Endogenous Retroviruses to the Drosophila Host Underlie their Evolutionary Diversification\nAuthors: Senti, K.-A.; Handler, D.; Rafanel, B.; Kosiol, C.; Schloetterer, C.; Brennecke, J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551782\nTransposable elements profoundly affect the biology and evolution of their hosts, yet their own evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate insect endogenous retroviruses (iERVs), a monophyletic group of LTR retrotransposons that have acquired the trait of infectivity, likely through capture of a Baculovirus envelope gene. In Drosophila ovaries, iERVs with functional envelope have adapted their cis-regulatory sequences to be expressed in any somatic cell type, from where they infect the germline. Strikingly, related retroviruses show distinct expression patterns, indicating niche partitioning. In contrast, all non-infectious iERVs that emerged through secondary envelope-loss are specifically expressed in the germline. Co-evolving with iERVs, the genome-protecting piRNA pathway has assimilated iERV promoter and sequence information into piRNA clusters, underscoring the functional significance of iERV expression in somatic niches. We propose that the evolutionary innovation of cell-to-cell infectivity has triggered the adaptive radiation of iERVs through trait diversification and antagonistic virus-host interactions, processes that likely underpin niche-specific expression of endogenous retroviruses in vertebrates as well.\nGenomic analysis supports Cape Lion population connectivity prior to colonial eradication and extinction\nAuthors: de Flamingh, A.; Gnoske, T. P.; Rivera-Colon, A. G.; Simeonovski, V. A.; Kerbis Peterhans, J. C.; Yamaguchi, N.; Witt, K. E.; Catchen, J. M.; Roca, A.; Malhi, R. S.\nScore: 6.9, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551389\nExtinct Cape lions (Panthera leo melanochaitus) formerly ranged throughout the grassland plains of the \"Cape Flats\" in what is today known as the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Cape lions were likely eradicated because of overhunting and habitat loss after European colonization. European naturalists originally described Cape lions as \"Black-maned lions\" and claimed that they were phenotypically distinct. However, other depictions and historical descriptions of lions from the Cape report mixed or light coloration and without black or extensively developed manes. These findings suggest that, rather than forming a distinct population, Cape lions may have had phenotypic and genotypic variation similar to other African lions. Here we investigate extinct Cape lion genome characteristics, population dynamics and genetic distinctiveness prior to their extinction. We generated genomic data from two historic Cape lions to compare to 118 existing high-coverage mitogenomes, and low-coverage nuclear genomes of 53 lions from 13 African countries. We show that, before their eradication, lions from the Cape Flats had diverse mitogenomes and nuclear genomes that clustered with lions from both southern and eastern Africa. Cape lions had high genome-wide heterozygosity and low inbreeding coefficients, indicating that populations in the Cape Flats went extinct so rapidly that genomic effects associated with long-term small population size and isolation were not detectable. Our findings do not support the characterization of Cape lions as phylogeographically distinct, as originally put forth by some European naturalists, but rather highlights how alternative knowledge-systems, e.g., Indigenous perspectives, could potentially further inform interpretations of species life histories.\nGenomic data suggest parallel dental vestigialization within the xenarthran radiation\nAuthors: Emerling, C. A.; Gibb, G. C.; Tilak, M.-K.; Hughes, J. J.; Kuch, M.; Duggan, A. T.; Poinar, H. N.; Nachman, M. W.; Delsuc, F.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2022.12.09.519446\nThe recent influx of genomic data has provided greater insights into the molecular basis for regressive evolution, or vestigialization, through gene loss and pseudogenization. As such, the analysis of gene degradation patterns has the potential to provide insights into the evolutionary history of regressed anatomical traits. We specifically applied these principles to the xenarthran radiation (anteaters, sloths, armadillos), which is characterized by taxa with a gradation in regressed dental phenotypes. Whether the pattern among extant xenarthrans is due to an ancient and gradual decay of dental morphology or occurred repeatedly in parallel is unknown. We tested these competing hypotheses by examining 11 core dental genes in most living species of Xenarthra, characterizing shared inactivating mutations and patterns of relaxed selection during their radiation. Here we report evidence of independent and distinct events of dental gene loss in the major xenarthran subclades. First, we found strong evidence of complete enamel loss in the common ancestor of sloths and anteaters, suggested by the inactivation of five enamel-associated genes (AMELX, AMTN, MMP20, ENAM, ACP4). Next, whereas dental regression appears to have halted in sloths, presumably a critical event that ultimately permitted adaptation to an herbivorous lifestyle, anteaters continued losing genes on the path towards complete tooth loss. Echoes of this event are recorded in the genomes of all living anteaters, being marked by a 2-bp deletion in a gene critical for dentinogenesis (DSPP) and a putative shared 1-bp insertion in a gene linked to tooth retention (ODAPH). By contrast, in the two major armadillo clades, genes pertaining to the dento-gingival junction and amelogenesis appear to have been independently inactivated prior to losing all or some enamel. These genomic data provide evidence for multiple pathways and rates of anatomical regression, and underscore the utility of using pseudogenes to reconstruct evolutionary history when fossils are sparse.\nMore than just density: the role of egg number, food volume and container dimensions in mediating larval competition in Drosophila melanogaster\nAuthors: Venkitachalam, S.; V.S., S.; Joshi, A.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.26.550621\nFlies of the genus Drosophila have been extensively used as model systems to study competition. Experiments using larval crowding in these species have furthered our understanding of competition ecology, stress-adaptation, density-dependent selection and population dynamics. Historically, larval competition has been induced by crowding the larvae in high density cultures, compared to low-density controls. However, recent studies have shown that two larval cultures having the same total eggs per mL food density, with different absolute quantities of eggs and food, can differ greatly in their density-specific fitness functions. Similarly, populations adapted to two types of cultures achieving the same density through different means, can also evolve different traits. Thus, it is clear that there is more to larval crowding than just eggs/food density, which has until now been the benchmark variable for quantifying larval crowding in Drosophila studies. In the current study, we explore the consequences of implementing crowding in different ways, using a three-way factorial experiment with egg number and food volume, cast into different food column heights or cylindrical vials with different diameters. We find that not just the same density, but cultures having the same egg number and food volume combination but experienced in food columns of varying height and diameter can have very different pre-adult survivorship and development times. We further propose a new variable for quantifying larval crowding - effective density, which is the density within the larval feeding band, a volume of food close to the surface, with access to air, wherein a majority of the larvae feed. We show that effective density is a much better predictor of the outcomes of competition than the popularly used total eggs/food density.\nHow Veeries vary: Whole genome sequencing resolves fine-scale genetic structure in a long-distance migratory bird, Catharus fuscescens\nAuthors: Kimmitt, A. A.; Pegan, T. M.; Jones, A. W.; Winker, K.; Winger, B.\nScore: 6.7, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550389\nFine-scale resolution of spatial genetic structure is important for understanding a species evolutionary history and contemporary genetic diversity. For high-latitude species with high dispersal ability, such as long-distance migratory birds, populations typically exhibit little genetic structure due to high gene flow and recent postglacial expansion. Some migratory birds, however, show high breeding site fidelity, which might reduce gene flow such that population genetic structure could be detectable with sufficient genomic data. We sequenced over 120 low-coverage whole genomes from across the breeding range of a long-distance migratory bird, the Veery (Catharus fuscescens). As this species breeding range extends across both historically glaciated and unglaciated regions in North America, we evaluated whether contemporary patterns of structure and genetic diversity are consistent with historical population isolation in glacial refugia. We found strong evidence for isolation by distance across the breeding range, as well as significant population structure between southern Appalachian and northern populations. However, patterns of genetic diversity did not support southern Appalachia as a glacial refugium. Resolution of isolation by distance across the breeding range was sufficient to assign likely breeding origins of individuals sampled in this species poorly understood South American nonbreeding range, demonstrating the potential to assess migratory connectivity in this species using genomic data. Overall, our findings suggest that isolation by distance yields subtle associations between genetic structure and geography across the breeding range even in the absence of obvious historical vicariance or contemporary barriers to dispersal.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Parthenogenetic lineages, common in many animals, have sparked debate about their evolutionary persistence. Even after the loss of male individuals, males can survive on the genomes; in fact, rarely occurring males were described in many asexual lineages. Theoretical predictions suggest that genes related to male sexual traits in parthenogenetic lineages will decay over long evolutionary times free from the pressure of stabilizing selection. However, in many cases, such rare males are potentially functional. In this study, we investigated the functionality of rare males in the Japanese parthenogenetic stick insect, Ramulus mikado. Rarely occurring males in the species exhibited the external and anatomical morphology typical in stick insect males, and vigorously and successfully performed mating behaviors with conspecific females; nevertheless, no paternal genotypes were detected in the offspring; all embryos were genetically identical to their mothers. Our histological observation demonstrated that females received a spermatophore without sperms in their copulatory pouch, and revealed that in a male, spermatogenesis was completely deformed. These results suggest the irreversible clonal reproduction of R. mikado due to compromised male function. Our present study provides the first case of evident dysfunction in rare males of stick insects, illuminating the degenerative evolution of sexual traits in asexual lineages.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fungal pathogens cause devastating disease in crops. Understanding the evolutionary origin of pathogens is essential to the prediction of future disease emergence and the potential of pathogens to disperse. The fungus Pyrenophora teres f. teres causes net form net blotch (NFNB), an economically significant disease of barley. In this study, we have used 104 P. teres f. teres genomes from four continents to explore the population structure and demographic history of the fungal pathogen. We showed that P. teres f. teres is structured into populations that tend to be geographically restricted to different regions. Using Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent and machine learning approaches we demonstrated that the demographic history of the pathogen correlates with the history of barley, highlighting the importance of human migration and trade in spreading the pathogen. Exploring signatures of natural selection, we identified several population-specific selective sweeps that colocalized with genomic regions enriched in putative virulence genes, and loci previously identified as determinants of virulence specificities by quantitative trait locus analyses. This reflects rapid adaptation to local hosts and environmental conditions of P. teres f. teres as it spread with barley. Our research highlights how human activities can contribute to the spread of pathogens that significantly impact the productivity of field crops.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Organisms can adapt to environmental heterogeneity through two mechanisms: (1) constitutive expression of population genetic variation or (2) phenotypic plasticity. We investigated whether patterns of plastic and constitutively expressed traits along elevational and latitudinal clines in a North American endemic plant, Mimulus laciniatus, were consistent with local adaptation. We grew inbred lines of M. laciniatus from across the species range to measure constitutive and plastic trait expression in several traits previously shown to be involved in adaptation to M. laciniatuss rocky outcrop microhabitat: flowering time, size-related traits, and leaf shape. We then tested for a relationship between variation in trait expression and population elevation and latitude, and examined correlation in trait expression between plastic and constitutive traits. We found that population variation in constitutive leaf lobing is associated with latitude, and identified multiple traits that show patterns consistent with local adaptation to elevation: critical photoperiod, flowering time, flower size, leaf lobing, and leaf lobing plasticity. These trends occur along multiple geographically independent altitudinal clines indicating that selection is a more likely cause of this pattern than gene flow among nearby populations with similar trait values. We did not find a correlation between constitutive and plastic leaf lobing at the individual genotype level, suggesting that while both traits appear to be adaptive, they operate under independent genetic controls. This indicates that both having more highly lobed leaves and greater leaf shape plasticity are likely adaptive at high elevation within M. laciniatus. Our data strongly suggest that traits known to be under divergent selection between M. laciniatus and close relative Mimulus guttatus are also under locally varying selection within M. laciniatus.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-genetic variation is the phenotypic variation induced by the differential expression of a genotype in response to varying environmental cues and is broadly categorized into two types: phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise. These variation aspects have been suggested to play an important role in adaptive evolution; however, the mechanisms by which these two types of non-genetic variations influence the evolutionary process are currently poorly understood. Using a machine-learning based phenotyping tool, we independently quantified the phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in the wing morphological traits of a fruit fly Drosophila simulans. Utilizing a rearing experiment, we demonstrated plastic responses in both wing size and shape as well as non-zero heritability of both phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, which suggests that adaptive phenotypic plasticity can evolve via genetic accommodation in the wing morphology of D. simulans. We found a positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, while the correlation between the plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors that were examined (nutrient condition, temperature, and light-dark cycle) were poor. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise contribute to evolvability in a similar manner, however, the mechanisms that underlie the correspondence between these two variation types remains to be elucidated.

Lay SummaryNon-genetic variations consist of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise, and these variations have been suggested to influence the direction and the rate of evolution. However, the role of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise in evolutionary process is still poorly understood. Using a rearing experiment, we examined the heritability of plasticity and developmental noise, the correlation of the strength of plastic response to three kinds of environmental factors, and the relationship between plasticity and developmental noise in wing size and wing shape in Drosophila simulans. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise were heritable, and positively correlated with each other. Our results suggest that there two non-genetic variations dependently affect the direction and the rate of evolution together.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Leveraging past allele frequencies has proven to be key to identify the impact of natural selection across time. However, this approach often suffers from imprecise estimations of the intensity (s) and timing (T) of selection particularly when ancient samples are scarce in specific epochs. Here, we aimed at bypassing the computation of past allele frequencies by implementing new convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithms that directly use ancient genotypes sampled across time to refine the estimations of selection parameters. Using computer simulations, we first show that genotype-based CNNs consistently outperform an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach based on past allele frequency trajectories, regardless of the selection model assumed and of the amount of ancient genotypes available. When applying this method to empirical data from modern and ancient Europeans, we confirmed the reported excess of selection events in post-Neolithic Europe, independently of the continental subregion studied. Furthermore, we substantially refined the ABC-based estimations of s and T for a set of positively-and negatively-selected variants recently identified, including iconic cases of positive selection and experimentally validated disease-risk variants. Thanks to our CNN predictions we provide support to the history of recent and strong selection in northern Europe associated to the Black Death pandemic and confirm the heavy burden recently imposed by tuberculosis in Europe. These findings collectively support that detecting the imprints of natural selection on ancient genomes are crucial for unraveling the past history of severe human diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Transposable elements profoundly affect the biology and evolution of their hosts, yet their own evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate insect endogenous retroviruses (iERVs), a monophyletic group of LTR retrotransposons that have acquired the trait of infectivity, likely through capture of a Baculovirus envelope gene. In Drosophila ovaries, iERVs with functional envelope have adapted their cis-regulatory sequences to be expressed in any somatic cell type, from where they infect the germline. Strikingly, related retroviruses show distinct expression patterns, indicating niche partitioning. In contrast, all non-infectious iERVs that emerged through secondary envelope-loss are specifically expressed in the germline. Co-evolving with iERVs, the genome-protecting piRNA pathway has assimilated iERV promoter and sequence information into piRNA clusters, underscoring the functional significance of iERV expression in somatic niches. We propose that the evolutionary innovation of cell-to-cell infectivity has triggered the adaptive radiation of iERVs through trait diversification and antagonistic virus-host interactions, processes that likely underpin niche-specific expression of endogenous retroviruses in vertebrates as well.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extinct Cape lions (Panthera leo melanochaitus) formerly ranged throughout the grassland plains of the &#34;Cape Flats&#34; in what is today known as the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Cape lions were likely eradicated because of overhunting and habitat loss after European colonization. European naturalists originally described Cape lions as &#34;Black-maned lions&#34; and claimed that they were phenotypically distinct. However, other depictions and historical descriptions of lions from the Cape report mixed or light coloration and without black or extensively developed manes. These findings suggest that, rather than forming a distinct population, Cape lions may have had phenotypic and genotypic variation similar to other African lions. Here we investigate extinct Cape lion genome characteristics, population dynamics and genetic distinctiveness prior to their extinction. We generated genomic data from two historic Cape lions to compare to 118 existing high-coverage mitogenomes, and low-coverage nuclear genomes of 53 lions from 13 African countries. We show that, before their eradication, lions from the Cape Flats had diverse mitogenomes and nuclear genomes that clustered with lions from both southern and eastern Africa. Cape lions had high genome-wide heterozygosity and low inbreeding coefficients, indicating that populations in the Cape Flats went extinct so rapidly that genomic effects associated with long-term small population size and isolation were not detectable. Our findings do not support the characterization of Cape lions as phylogeographically distinct, as originally put forth by some European naturalists, but rather highlights how alternative knowledge-systems, e.g., Indigenous perspectives, could potentially further inform interpretations of species life histories.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The recent influx of genomic data has provided greater insights into the molecular basis for regressive evolution, or vestigialization, through gene loss and pseudogenization. As such, the analysis of gene degradation patterns has the potential to provide insights into the evolutionary history of regressed anatomical traits. We specifically applied these principles to the xenarthran radiation (anteaters, sloths, armadillos), which is characterized by taxa with a gradation in regressed dental phenotypes. Whether the pattern among extant xenarthrans is due to an ancient and gradual decay of dental morphology or occurred repeatedly in parallel is unknown. We tested these competing hypotheses by examining 11 core dental genes in most living species of Xenarthra, characterizing shared inactivating mutations and patterns of relaxed selection during their radiation. Here we report evidence of independent and distinct events of dental gene loss in the major xenarthran subclades. First, we found strong evidence of complete enamel loss in the common ancestor of sloths and anteaters, suggested by the inactivation of five enamel-associated genes (AMELX, AMTN, MMP20, ENAM, ACP4). Next, whereas dental regression appears to have halted in sloths, presumably a critical event that ultimately permitted adaptation to an herbivorous lifestyle, anteaters continued losing genes on the path towards complete tooth loss. Echoes of this event are recorded in the genomes of all living anteaters, being marked by a 2-bp deletion in a gene critical for dentinogenesis (DSPP) and a putative shared 1-bp insertion in a gene linked to tooth retention (ODAPH). By contrast, in the two major armadillo clades, genes pertaining to the dento-gingival junction and amelogenesis appear to have been independently inactivated prior to losing all or some enamel. These genomic data provide evidence for multiple pathways and rates of anatomical regression, and underscore the utility of using pseudogenes to reconstruct evolutionary history when fossils are sparse.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Flies of the genus Drosophila have been extensively used as model systems to study competition. Experiments using larval crowding in these species have furthered our understanding of competition ecology, stress-adaptation, density-dependent selection and population dynamics. Historically, larval competition has been induced by crowding the larvae in high density cultures, compared to low-density controls. However, recent studies have shown that two larval cultures having the same total eggs per mL food density, with different absolute quantities of eggs and food, can differ greatly in their density-specific fitness functions. Similarly, populations adapted to two types of cultures achieving the same density through different means, can also evolve different traits. Thus, it is clear that there is more to larval crowding than just eggs/food density, which has until now been the benchmark variable for quantifying larval crowding in Drosophila studies. In the current study, we explore the consequences of implementing crowding in different ways, using a three-way factorial experiment with egg number and food volume, cast into different food column heights or cylindrical vials with different diameters. We find that not just the same density, but cultures having the same egg number and food volume combination but experienced in food columns of varying height and diameter can have very different pre-adult survivorship and development times. We further propose a new variable for quantifying larval crowding - effective density, which is the density within the larval feeding band, a volume of food close to the surface, with access to air, wherein a majority of the larvae feed. We show that effective density is a much better predictor of the outcomes of competition than the popularly used total eggs/food density.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fine-scale resolution of spatial genetic structure is important for understanding a species evolutionary history and contemporary genetic diversity. For high-latitude species with high dispersal ability, such as long-distance migratory birds, populations typically exhibit little genetic structure due to high gene flow and recent postglacial expansion. Some migratory birds, however, show high breeding site fidelity, which might reduce gene flow such that population genetic structure could be detectable with sufficient genomic data. We sequenced over 120 low-coverage whole genomes from across the breeding range of a long-distance migratory bird, the Veery (Catharus fuscescens). As this species breeding range extends across both historically glaciated and unglaciated regions in North America, we evaluated whether contemporary patterns of structure and genetic diversity are consistent with historical population isolation in glacial refugia. We found strong evidence for isolation by distance across the breeding range, as well as significant population structure between southern Appalachian and northern populations. However, patterns of genetic diversity did not support southern Appalachia as a glacial refugium. Resolution of isolation by distance across the breeding range was sufficient to assign likely breeding origins of individuals sampled in this species poorly understood South American nonbreeding range, demonstrating the potential to assess migratory connectivity in this species using genomic data. Overall, our findings suggest that isolation by distance yields subtle associations between genetic structure and geography across the breeding range even in the absence of obvious historical vicariance or contemporary barriers to dispersal.</p>
