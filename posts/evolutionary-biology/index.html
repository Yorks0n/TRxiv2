C.; Ghezelayagh, A.; Dornburg, A.; Near, T. J.\nScore: 105.7, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575380\nMajor ecological transitions are thought to fuel evolutionary radiations, but whether they are contingent on the evolution of certain traits is unclear. We show that the rapid ecological transition of anglerfishes into pelagic habitats during a period of major global warming coincided with the origins of sexual parasitism, in which male anglerfishes temporarily attach or permanently fuse to females to mate. A phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of anglerfishes provides a strong inference for the convergent evolution of permanently-fusing deep-sea anglerfishes and their degenerate immune genes. Our results support that sexual parasitism was enabled by the degeneration of adaptive immunity and ancestral sexual size dimorphism. The combination of these traits facilitated the transition of pelagic anglerfishes into novel ecologies available in the deep open oceans after evolving from benthic ancestors. These results show how seemingly unrelated physiological and reproductive traits interact synergistically to drive evolutionary radiation in novel environments.\nRecurrent Evolutionary Innovations in Rodent and Primate Schlafen Genes\nAuthors: Mordier, J.; Fraisse, M.; Cohen-Tannoudji, M.; Molaro, A.\nScore: 15.7, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575368\nSCHLAFEN proteins are a large family of RNase-related enzymes carrying essential immune and developmental functions. Despite these important roles, Schlafen genes display varying degrees of evolutionary conservation in mammals. While this appears to influence their molecular activities, a detailed understanding of these evolutionary innovations is still lacking. Here, we used in depth phylogenomic approaches to characterize the evolutionary trajectories and selective forces shaping mammalian Schlafen genes. We traced lineage-specific Schlafen amplifications and found that recent duplicates evolved under distinct selective forces, supporting repeated sub-functionalization cycles. Codon-level natural selection analyses in primates and rodents, identified recurrent positive selection over Schlafen protein domains engaged in viral interactions. Combining crystal structures with machine learning predictions, we discovered a novel class of rapidly evolving residues enriched at the contact interface of SCHLAFEN protein dimers. Our results suggest that inter Schlafen compatibilities are under strong selective pressures and are likely to impact their molecular functions. We posit that cycles of genetic conflicts with pathogens and between paralogs drove Schlafens recurrent evolutionary innovations in mammals.\nGenomic evidence for supergene control of Darwin's 'complex marriage arrangement' - the tristylous floral polymorphism\nAuthors: Xue, H.; Gong, Y.; Wright, S. I.; Barrett, S. C. H.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575583\nTristyly is a sexual polymorphism characterized by three flower morphs with reciprocal stigma and anther heights controlled by two epistatically interacting diallelic loci (S and M), hypothesized to be supergenes. Chromosome-level genome assemblies of Eichhornia paniculata identified the S- and M-loci. The S-locus is a supergene consisting of two divergent alleles: The S-allele (2.51 Mb), with three S-allele specific genes hemizygous in most S-morph plants and the s-allele (596 kb) with five s-allele specific genes. Two of the S-allele specific genes, LAZY1-S and HRGP-S, were specifically expressed in styles and stamens, respectively, making them tristyly candidate genes. The M-locus contains one gene (LAZY1-M) present in the M-allele but absent from the m-allele and which is homologous to LAZY1-S. Estimates of allele age are consistent with theory predicting that the S-locus evolved before the M-locus. Re-use of the same gene family highlights the potential role of gene duplication in the evolution of epistatic multilocus polymorphisms.\nNortheast India: Genetic Inconsistency across Ethnicity and Geography\nAuthors: Bankura, B.; Basak, B.; Singh, P. P.; Vanlalruata, A.; Chatterjee, A.; Ghosh, S.; Tamang, R.; Hazarika, M.; Chaubey, G.; Das, M.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574778\nThe genetic landscape of South Asia is intriguing. In a vast geographical region like India, mostly genes follow geography, whereas in a smaller geographical region e.g., Nepal, the genetic landscape is more akin to languages. Moreover, in neighboring regions like East and Southeast Asia, language is the major denominator of the genes. However, these are not just the two alternatives, in many geographical pockets, ethnicity plays a stronger role than either of these. Being a crossroads of South and Southeast Asia, the Himalayan region is mostly populated by people speaking the Trans-Himalayan language. Archaeological and anthropological studies suggest migration and cultural diffusion in this region with the Tibetan plateau in the North. To understand this complex pattern, we have performed a fine-grained genetic analysis of the major Mizo population and its various clans living in the Himalayan geography. We have investigated 110 individuals belonging to seven different clans of Mizo people for a hundred thousand autosomal markers. We have used various statistical methods and tested the role of ethnicity and geography in shaping the genetic landscape of the Himalayan region. In contrast to the East and Southeast Asian genetic landscape, our results suggested that the fine-scaled genetic structure of Northeast India is much more complex and a mixture of interplay between languages, ethnicity, and geography. Allelic frequency-based analyses indicated that a novel Trans-Himalayan ancestry unite all the populations of this region.\nAncestral Sequence Reconstruction as a tool to detect and study de novo gene emergence\nAuthors: Vakirlis, N.; Acar, O.; Cherupally, V. K.; Carvunis, A.-R.\nScore: 29.6, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.02.573862\nNew protein-coding genes can evolve from previously non-coding genomic regions through a process known as de novo gene emergence. Evidence suggests that this process has likely occurred throughout evolution and across the tree of life. Yet, confidently identifying de novo emerged genes remains challenging. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) is a promising approach for inferring whether a gene has emerged de novo or not, as it can enable us to inspect whether a given genomic locus ancestrally harbored protein-coding capacity. However, the use of ASR in the context of de novo emergence is still in its infancy and its capabilities, limitations, and overall potential are largely unknown. Notably, it is difficult to formally evaluate the protein-coding capacity of ancestral sequences, particularly when new gene candidates are short. How well-suited is ASR as a tool for the detection and study of de novo genes? Here, we address this question by designing an ASR workflow incorporating different tools and sets of parameters and by introducing a formal criterion that allows to estimate, within a desired level of confidence, when protein-coding capacity originated at a particular locus. Applying this workflow on [~]2,600 short, annotated budding yeast genes (\u003c1,000 nucleotides), we found that ASR robustly predicts an ancient origin for most widely conserved genes, which constitute \"easy\" cases. For less robust cases, we calculated a randomization-based empirical P-value estimating whether the observed conservation between the extant and ancestral reading frame could be attributed to chance. This formal criterion allowed us to pinpoint a branch of origin for most of the less robust cases, identifying 33 genes that can unequivocally be considered de novo originated since the split of the Saccharomyces genus, including 20 S. cerevisiae-specific genes. We find that the remaining, equivocal cases, may be explained by different evolutionary scenarios including rapid evolution and multiple losses, as well as a very recent de novo origin. Overall, our findings suggest that ASR is a valuable tool to study de novo gene emergence but should be applied with caution and awareness of its limitations.\nEmpirical evidence of resource dependent evolution of payoff matrices in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations.\nAuthors: Venkataraman, P.; Mahilkar, A.; Raj, N.; Saini, S.\nScore: 4.7, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575778\nIn evolutionary game theory, a relative comparison of the cost and benefit associated with obtaining a resource, called payoff, is used as an indicator of fitness of an organism. Such payoff matrices are used to understand complex inter-species and intra-species interactions like cooperation, mutualism, and altruism. In the absence of any empirical data, the evolution of these payoff matrices has been investigated theoretically by tweaking well-established game theory models. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of three types of resource-dependent changes in the payoff matrices of evolving Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We show that depending on the carbon source and participating genotypes, the payoff matrix could either (a) evolve quantitatively yet maintain a cheater-cooperator game, (b) change qualitatively such that the cheater-cooperator game collapses, or (c) change qualitatively to result in the birth of a cheater-cooperator game. Our results highlight the need to consider the dynamic nature of payoff matrices while making even short-term predictions about population interactions and dynamics.\nOrigin and evolutionary trajectories of brown algal sex chromosomes\nAuthors: Barrera-Redondo, J.; Lipinska, A. P.; Liu, P.; Dinatale, E.; Cossard, G.; Bogaert, K.; Hoshino, M.; Avia, K.; Avdievich, E.; Leiria, G.; Liesner, D.; Luthringer, R.; Godfroy, O.; Heesch, S.; Nehr, Z.; Peters, A. F.; Hoarau, G.; Pearson, G. A.; Aury, J.-M.; Wincker, P.; Denoeud, F.; Cock, J. M.; Haas, F. B.; Coelho, S. M.\nScore: 4.6, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.15.575685\nSex chromosomes fall into three classes: XX/XY, ZW/ZZ and U/V systems. The rise, evolution and demise of U/V systems have remained enigmatic to date. Here, we analyze genomes spanning the entire brown algal phylogeny to decipher their sex-determination evolutionary history. The birth of U/V sex chromosomes evolved more than 250 million years ago, when a pivotal male-determinant located in a discrete region in proto-U and proto-V chromosomes ceased recombining. Over time, nested inversions led to step-wise expansions, accompanying increasing morphological complexity and sexual differentiation of brown seaweeds. Unlike XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, U/V evolve mainly by gene gain, showing minimal degeneration. They are structurally dynamic, and act as genomic cradles fostering the birth of new genes. Our analyses show that hermaphroditism arose from ancestral males that acquired U-specific genes by ectopic recombination, and that in the transition from a U/V to an XX/XY system, V-specific genes moved down the genetic hierarchy of sex determination. Both events lead to the demise of U and V and erosion of their specific genomic characteristics. Taken together, our findings offer a comprehensive model of U/V sex chromosome evolution. HIGHLIGHTSSexes arose in brown algae due to ceased recombination of a male-determining gene-containing region U/V sex chromosomes evolve via gene gain and act as cradles of genomic novelty Emergence of XX/XY chromosomes involved demotion of the V-master sex-determining gene Introgression of female-specific genes into a male background allowed hermaphroditism to arise\nConvergent reductive evolution of cyanobacteria in symbiosis with Dinophysiales dinoflagellates\nAuthors: Nakayama, T.; Nomura, M.; Yabuki, A.; Shiba, K.; Inaba, K.; Inagaki, Y.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.574452\nThe diversity of marine cyanobacteria has been extensively studied due to their vital roles in ocean primary production. However, little is understood about the diversity of cyanobacterial species involved in symbiotic relationships. In this study, we successfully sequenced the complete genome of a cyanobacterium in symbiosis with Citharistes regius, a dinoflagellate species thriving in the open ocean. A phylogenomic analysis revealed that the cyanobacterium (CregCyn) belongs to the marine picocyanobacterial lineage, akin to another cyanobacterial symbiont (OmCyn) of a different dinoflagellate closely related to Citharistes. Nevertheless, these two symbionts are distinct lineages, suggesting independent origins of their symbiotic lifestyles. Despite the distinct origins, the genome analyses of CregCyn revealed shared characteristics with OmCyn, including an obligate symbiotic relationship with the host dinoflagellates and a degree of genome reduction. In contrast, a detailed analysis of genome subregions unveiled that the CregCyn genome carries genomic islands that are not found in the OmCyn genome. The presence of the genomic islands implies that exogenous genes have been integrated into the CregCyn genome at some point in its evolution. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex history of the symbiosis between dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, as well as the genomic diversity of marine picocyanobacteria.\nSignatures of adaptation at key insecticide resistance loci in Anopheles gambiae in Southern Ghana revealed by low-coverage WGS.\nAuthors: Dennis, T. P. W.; Essandoh, J.; Mable, B. K.; Viana, M.; Egyir-Yawson, A.; Weetman, D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.575856\nResistance to insecticides and adaptation to a diverse range of environments present challenges to Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquito control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Whole-genome-sequencing is often employed for identifying the genomic basis underlying adaptation in Anopheles, but remains expensive for large-scale surveys. Low-coverage whole-genome-sequencing (lcWGS) can identify regions of the genome involved in adaptation at a lower cost, but is currently untested in Anopheles mosquitoes. Here, we use lcWGS to investigate population genetic structure and identify signatures of local adaptation in Anopheles mosquitoes across southern Ghana. In contrast to previous analyses, we find no structuring by ecoregion, with Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae populations largely displaying the hallmarks of large, unstructured populations. However, we find signatures of selection at insecticide resistance (IR) loci that appear ubiquitous across ecoregions in An. coluzzii, and strongest in forest ecoregions in An. gambiae. In the IR gene Cyp9k1, we find species-specific alleles under selection, suggesting interspecific variation in the precise mechanism of resistance conferred by Cyp9k1. Our study highlights resistance candidate genes in this region, and validates lcWGS, potentially to very low coverage levels, for population genomics and exploratory surveys for adaptation in Anopheles taxa.\nEvidence for compensatory evolution within pleiotropic regulatory elements\nAuthors: Kliesmete, Z.; Orchard, P.; Lee, V. Y. K.; Geuder, J.; Krauss, S. M.; Ohnuki, M.; Jocher, J.; Vieth, B.; Enard, W.; Hellmann, I.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575014\nPleiotropy, measured as expression breadth across tissues, is one of the best predictors for protein sequence and expression conservation. In this study, we investigated its effect on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). To this end, we carefully reanalyzed the Epigenomics Roadmap data for nine fetal tissues, assigning a measure of pleiotropic degree to nearly half a million CREs. To assess the functional conservation of CREs, we generated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from humans and macaques. We found that more pleiotropic CREs exhibit greater conservation in accessibility, and the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes are more conserved. This trend of higher conservation for higher degrees of pleiotropy persists when analyzing the transcription factor binding repertoire. In contrast, simple DNA sequence conservation of orthologous sites between species tends to be even lower for pleiotropic CREs than for species-specific CREs. Combining various lines of evidence, we suggest that the lack of sequence conservation for functionally conserved pleiotropic elements is due to compensatory evolution within these large pleiotropic CREs. Furthermore, for less pleiotropic CREs, we find an indication of compensation across CREs. This suggests that pleiotropy is also a good predictor for the functional conservation of CREs, but this is not reflected in the sequence conservation for pleiotropic CREs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Major ecological transitions are thought to fuel evolutionary radiations, but whether they are contingent on the evolution of certain traits is unclear. We show that the rapid ecological transition of anglerfishes into pelagic habitats during a period of major global warming coincided with the origins of sexual parasitism, in which male anglerfishes temporarily attach or permanently fuse to females to mate. A phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of anglerfishes provides a strong inference for the convergent evolution of permanently-fusing deep-sea anglerfishes and their degenerate immune genes. Our results support that sexual parasitism was enabled by the degeneration of adaptive immunity and ancestral sexual size dimorphism. The combination of these traits facilitated the transition of pelagic anglerfishes into novel ecologies available in the deep open oceans after evolving from benthic ancestors. These results show how seemingly unrelated physiological and reproductive traits interact synergistically to drive evolutionary radiation in novel environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">SCHLAFEN proteins are a large family of RNase-related enzymes carrying essential immune and developmental functions. Despite these important roles, Schlafen genes display varying degrees of evolutionary conservation in mammals. While this appears to influence their molecular activities, a detailed understanding of these evolutionary innovations is still lacking. Here, we used in depth phylogenomic approaches to characterize the evolutionary trajectories and selective forces shaping mammalian Schlafen genes. We traced lineage-specific Schlafen amplifications and found that recent duplicates evolved under distinct selective forces, supporting repeated sub-functionalization cycles. Codon-level natural selection analyses in primates and rodents, identified recurrent positive selection over Schlafen protein domains engaged in viral interactions. Combining crystal structures with machine learning predictions, we discovered a novel class of rapidly evolving residues enriched at the contact interface of SCHLAFEN protein dimers. Our results suggest that inter Schlafen compatibilities are under strong selective pressures and are likely to impact their molecular functions. We posit that cycles of genetic conflicts with pathogens and between paralogs drove Schlafens recurrent evolutionary innovations in mammals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tristyly is a sexual polymorphism characterized by three flower morphs with reciprocal stigma and anther heights controlled by two epistatically interacting diallelic loci (S and M), hypothesized to be supergenes. Chromosome-level genome assemblies of Eichhornia paniculata identified the S- and M-loci. The S-locus is a supergene consisting of two divergent alleles: The S-allele (2.51 Mb), with three S-allele specific genes hemizygous in most S-morph plants and the s-allele (596 kb) with five s-allele specific genes. Two of the S-allele specific genes, LAZY1-S and HRGP-S, were specifically expressed in styles and stamens, respectively, making them tristyly candidate genes. The M-locus contains one gene (LAZY1-M) present in the M-allele but absent from the m-allele and which is homologous to LAZY1-S. Estimates of allele age are consistent with theory predicting that the S-locus evolved before the M-locus. Re-use of the same gene family highlights the potential role of gene duplication in the evolution of epistatic multilocus polymorphisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The genetic landscape of South Asia is intriguing. In a vast geographical region like India, mostly genes follow geography, whereas in a smaller geographical region e.g., Nepal, the genetic landscape is more akin to languages. Moreover, in neighboring regions like East and Southeast Asia, language is the major denominator of the genes. However, these are not just the two alternatives, in many geographical pockets, ethnicity plays a stronger role than either of these. Being a crossroads of South and Southeast Asia, the Himalayan region is mostly populated by people speaking the Trans-Himalayan language. Archaeological and anthropological studies suggest migration and cultural diffusion in this region with the Tibetan plateau in the North. To understand this complex pattern, we have performed a fine-grained genetic analysis of the major Mizo population and its various clans living in the Himalayan geography. We have investigated 110 individuals belonging to seven different clans of Mizo people for a hundred thousand autosomal markers. We have used various statistical methods and tested the role of ethnicity and geography in shaping the genetic landscape of the Himalayan region. In contrast to the East and Southeast Asian genetic landscape, our results suggested that the fine-scaled genetic structure of Northeast India is much more complex and a mixture of interplay between languages, ethnicity, and geography. Allelic frequency-based analyses indicated that a novel Trans-Himalayan ancestry unite all the populations of this region.</p>

        <p class="abstract">New protein-coding genes can evolve from previously non-coding genomic regions through a process known as de novo gene emergence. Evidence suggests that this process has likely occurred throughout evolution and across the tree of life. Yet, confidently identifying de novo emerged genes remains challenging. Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction (ASR) is a promising approach for inferring whether a gene has emerged de novo or not, as it can enable us to inspect whether a given genomic locus ancestrally harbored protein-coding capacity. However, the use of ASR in the context of de novo emergence is still in its infancy and its capabilities, limitations, and overall potential are largely unknown. Notably, it is difficult to formally evaluate the protein-coding capacity of ancestral sequences, particularly when new gene candidates are short. How well-suited is ASR as a tool for the detection and study of de novo genes? Here, we address this question by designing an ASR workflow incorporating different tools and sets of parameters and by introducing a formal criterion that allows to estimate, within a desired level of confidence, when protein-coding capacity originated at a particular locus. Applying this workflow on [~]2,600 short, annotated budding yeast genes (&lt;1,000 nucleotides), we found that ASR robustly predicts an ancient origin for most widely conserved genes, which constitute &#34;easy&#34; cases. For less robust cases, we calculated a randomization-based empirical P-value estimating whether the observed conservation between the extant and ancestral reading frame could be attributed to chance. This formal criterion allowed us to pinpoint a branch of origin for most of the less robust cases, identifying 33 genes that can unequivocally be considered de novo originated since the split of the Saccharomyces genus, including 20 S. cerevisiae-specific genes. We find that the remaining, equivocal cases, may be explained by different evolutionary scenarios including rapid evolution and multiple losses, as well as a very recent de novo origin. Overall, our findings suggest that ASR is a valuable tool to study de novo gene emergence but should be applied with caution and awareness of its limitations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In evolutionary game theory, a relative comparison of the cost and benefit associated with obtaining a resource, called payoff, is used as an indicator of fitness of an organism. Such payoff matrices are used to understand complex inter-species and intra-species interactions like cooperation, mutualism, and altruism. In the absence of any empirical data, the evolution of these payoff matrices has been investigated theoretically by tweaking well-established game theory models. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of three types of resource-dependent changes in the payoff matrices of evolving Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We show that depending on the carbon source and participating genotypes, the payoff matrix could either (a) evolve quantitatively yet maintain a cheater-cooperator game, (b) change qualitatively such that the cheater-cooperator game collapses, or (c) change qualitatively to result in the birth of a cheater-cooperator game. Our results highlight the need to consider the dynamic nature of payoff matrices while making even short-term predictions about population interactions and dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sex chromosomes fall into three classes: XX/XY, ZW/ZZ and U/V systems. The rise, evolution and demise of U/V systems have remained enigmatic to date. Here, we analyze genomes spanning the entire brown algal phylogeny to decipher their sex-determination evolutionary history. The birth of U/V sex chromosomes evolved more than 250 million years ago, when a pivotal male-determinant located in a discrete region in proto-U and proto-V chromosomes ceased recombining. Over time, nested inversions led to step-wise expansions, accompanying increasing morphological complexity and sexual differentiation of brown seaweeds. Unlike XX/XY and ZW/ZZ, U/V evolve mainly by gene gain, showing minimal degeneration. They are structurally dynamic, and act as genomic cradles fostering the birth of new genes. Our analyses show that hermaphroditism arose from ancestral males that acquired U-specific genes by ectopic recombination, and that in the transition from a U/V to an XX/XY system, V-specific genes moved down the genetic hierarchy of sex determination. Both events lead to the demise of U and V and erosion of their specific genomic characteristics. Taken together, our findings offer a comprehensive model of U/V sex chromosome evolution.

HIGHLIGHTSSexes arose in brown algae due to ceased recombination of a male-determining gene-containing region

U/V sex chromosomes evolve via gene gain and act as  cradles of genomic novelty

Emergence of XX/XY chromosomes involved demotion of the V-master sex-determining gene

Introgression of female-specific genes into a male background allowed hermaphroditism to arise</p>

        <p class="abstract">The diversity of marine cyanobacteria has been extensively studied due to their vital roles in ocean primary production. However, little is understood about the diversity of cyanobacterial species involved in symbiotic relationships. In this study, we successfully sequenced the complete genome of a cyanobacterium in symbiosis with Citharistes regius, a dinoflagellate species thriving in the open ocean. A phylogenomic analysis revealed that the cyanobacterium (CregCyn) belongs to the marine picocyanobacterial lineage, akin to another cyanobacterial symbiont (OmCyn) of a different dinoflagellate closely related to Citharistes. Nevertheless, these two symbionts are distinct lineages, suggesting independent origins of their symbiotic lifestyles. Despite the distinct origins, the genome analyses of CregCyn revealed shared characteristics with OmCyn, including an obligate symbiotic relationship with the host dinoflagellates and a degree of genome reduction. In contrast, a detailed analysis of genome subregions unveiled that the CregCyn genome carries genomic islands that are not found in the OmCyn genome. The presence of the genomic islands implies that exogenous genes have been integrated into the CregCyn genome at some point in its evolution. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex history of the symbiosis between dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, as well as the genomic diversity of marine picocyanobacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Resistance to insecticides and adaptation to a diverse range of environments present challenges to Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquito control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Whole-genome-sequencing is often employed for identifying the genomic basis underlying adaptation in Anopheles, but remains expensive for large-scale surveys. Low-coverage whole-genome-sequencing (lcWGS) can identify regions of the genome involved in adaptation at a lower cost, but is currently untested in Anopheles mosquitoes. Here, we use lcWGS to investigate population genetic structure and identify signatures of local adaptation in Anopheles mosquitoes across southern Ghana. In contrast to previous analyses, we find no structuring by ecoregion, with Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae populations largely displaying the hallmarks of large, unstructured populations. However, we find signatures of selection at insecticide resistance (IR) loci that appear ubiquitous across ecoregions in An. coluzzii, and strongest in forest ecoregions in An. gambiae. In the IR gene Cyp9k1, we find species-specific alleles under selection, suggesting interspecific variation in the precise mechanism of resistance conferred by Cyp9k1. Our study highlights resistance candidate genes in this region, and validates lcWGS, potentially to very low coverage levels, for population genomics and exploratory surveys for adaptation in Anopheles taxa.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Pleiotropy, measured as expression breadth across tissues, is one of the best predictors for protein sequence and expression conservation. In this study, we investigated its effect on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). To this end, we carefully reanalyzed the Epigenomics Roadmap data for nine fetal tissues, assigning a measure of pleiotropic degree to nearly half a million CREs. To assess the functional conservation of CREs, we generated ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from humans and macaques. We found that more pleiotropic CREs exhibit greater conservation in accessibility, and the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes are more conserved. This trend of higher conservation for higher degrees of pleiotropy persists when analyzing the transcription factor binding repertoire. In contrast, simple DNA sequence conservation of orthologous sites between species tends to be even lower for pleiotropic CREs than for species-specific CREs. Combining various lines of evidence, we suggest that the lack of sequence conservation for functionally conserved pleiotropic elements is due to compensatory evolution within these large pleiotropic CREs. Furthermore, for less pleiotropic CREs, we find an indication of compensation across CREs. This suggests that pleiotropy is also a good predictor for the functional conservation of CREs, but this is not reflected in the sequence conservation for pleiotropic CREs.</p>
