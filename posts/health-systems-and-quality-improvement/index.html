The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the spring of 2020 in the United States and around the world resulted in a surge in the need for acute and critical care services for patient with acute respiratory disease. Many individual hospitals and health systems were unprepared for this surge of patients with a novel and acute respiratory disease which may have exacerbated pre-existing disparities. To prepare for this challenge the Yale New Haven Health System developed a response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020 which was multifactorial including: 1) Implementation of a uniform COVID management protocol across the care continuum, 2) Precise criteria for hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Stepdown Unit (SDU) admission, 3) Augmented ICU and SDU bed availability, 4) Implemented load balancing across the entire health system. To understand the impact of these interventions we reviewed and compared mortality across the Yale-New Haven Health System both between hospitals and to national data. We also analyzed administration of medications to understand local adherence to the COVID-19 management protocol implemented during the initial wave of the pandemic. MethodsThis investigation is an observational, retrospective study of 3,112 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic in southern Connecticut and Rhode Island. All COVID-19 admissions to the Yale New Have Health System from March through June of 2020 were included. Patients all received care at a hospital within the Yale New Haven Health System which has 2693 beds across 7 campuses in southern Connecticut and Rhode Island. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19. Demographics were extracted as well as specific data associated with process of care including timing of administration of Tocilizumab, aspirin, and corticosteroids. Transfers between hospitals within the health system were identified. Mortality rates were compared between the central tertiary care hospital and the smaller community and community teaching hospitals using logistic regression to adjust for patient factors. ResultsAnalysis of process of care metrics including time to Tocilizumab, aspirin, and corticosteroids shows adherence of recommended processes of care across Yale New Haven Health System. The overall mortality rate of 15.9% was lower than published national comparators. Hospital mortality rates compared between the central tertiary care center and smaller hospitals within the system were similar when adjusted for multiple patient factors including race and ethnicity. ConclusionsIn this investigation of COVID-19 outcomes in an academic health system with geographic and social diversity, we find that the observed low mortality rate was consistent across the health system. We propose that this is in part related to consistency of care and structural factors such as load balancing. We believe that these findings highlight the potential value of implementing uniform processes designed to reduce noise and bias in clinical judgment.\nA Novel Artificial Intelligence Platform to Automate Clinical Consultation Notes and Enhance Diagnostic Efficiency in the Outpatient Clinic: A Multi-Center, Multi-Disciplinary, Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial\nAuthors: Gill, K.; Cacciamani, G.; Nabhani, J.; Corb, J.; Buchanan, T.; Park, D.; Bhardwaj, V.; Marwah, O.; Kim, M.; Kapoor, D.; Kutikov, A.; Uzzo, R.; Gill, I.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.23291879\nPresented herein is the protocol for a multi-center, multi-disciplinary randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology that automates the construction of the clinical consultation note (CCN) and enhances diagnostic assessments in the outpatient clinic setting. This innovative tech-platform automatically generates the CCN and presents it to the provider in advance of the patient consultation, without any work done by the provider. The constructed CCN is presented either in the native electronic health record (EHR) or in a secure web-based application, in a HIPAA-compliant manner. This prospective trial will compare this novel AI/ML technology (NAMT) versus the current standard-of-care (SOC) in the outpatient setting. Outpatient clinic-days will be randomized to either \"SOC clinic-day\" or the \"NAMT clinic-day\" based on whether the SOC or the NAMT was used to construct the CCN for all patients seen on that particular clinic-day. Randomized cross-over of each provider between \"SOC clinic-day\" and \"NAMT clinic-day\" will result in each provider serving as her/his own internal control. Objective data will be used to compare study endpoints between the SOC and the NAMT. Co-primary endpoints include a) CCN diagnostic accuracy/quality (based on standardized QNOTE metrics); and b) Work-outside-work (WOW) time required by providers to complete clinic-related documentation tasks outside clinic hours (based on EHR meta-data). Secondary endpoints include a) Provider productivity (based on provider \"walk-in, walk-out time from the consultation room); b) Provider satisfaction (based on the standardized AHRQ EHR End User Survey); and c) Patient satisfaction (based on the standardized Press Ganey/CG-CAHPS survey). To assess generalizability across the health-care spectrum, the study will be conducted in four different types of health-care settings (large academic medical center; non-academic hospital; rural hospital; community private practice); in four different disciplines (cardiology; infectious disease; urology; emergency medicine); using four different EHR systems (Cerner; Epic; AllScripts; MediTech/UroChart). We estimate an aggregate RCT sample size of 150 clinic-days (involving 3,000 total patients; 15-30 providers). This will randomize 75 clinic-days (1,500 patients) to the control SOC arm, and 75 clinic-days (1,500 patients) to the intervention NAMT arm. We will use a two-sided Z-test of difference between proportions with 90% power and two-sided 5% significance level. This RCT is the first to evaluate the efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of pre-constructing CCNs in an automated manner using AI/ML technology, deployed at a large-scale, multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, multi-EHR level. Results from this study will provide definitive level 1 evidence about the desirability and generalizability of AI-generated automatically constructed CCNs, assessing its potential benefits for providers, patients, and healthcare systems.\n",

Objective data will be used to compare study endpoints between the SOC and the NAMT. Co-primary endpoints include a) CCN diagnostic accuracy/quality (based on standardized QNOTE metrics); and b) Work-outside-work (WOW) time required by providers to complete clinic-related documentation tasks outside clinic hours (based on EHR meta-data). Secondary endpoints include a) Provider productivity (based on provider &#34;walk-in, walk-out time from the consultation room); b) Provider satisfaction (based on the standardized AHRQ EHR End User Survey); and c) Patient satisfaction (based on the standardized Press Ganey/CG-CAHPS survey). To assess generalizability across the health-care spectrum, the study will be conducted in four different types of health-care settings (large academic medical center; non-academic hospital; rural hospital; community private practice); in four different disciplines (cardiology; infectious disease; urology; emergency medicine); using four different EHR systems (Cerner; Epic; AllScripts; MediTech/UroChart). We estimate an aggregate RCT sample size of 150 clinic-days (involving 3,000 total patients; 15-30 providers). This will randomize 75 clinic-days (1,500 patients) to the control SOC arm, and 75 clinic-days (1,500 patients) to the intervention NAMT arm. We will use a two-sided Z-test of difference between proportions with 90% power and two-sided 5% significance level.

This RCT is the first to evaluate the efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of pre-constructing CCNs in an automated manner using AI/ML technology, deployed at a large-scale, multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, multi-EHR level. Results from this study will provide definitive level 1 evidence about the desirability and generalizability of AI-generated automatically constructed CCNs, assessing its potential benefits for providers, patients, and healthcare systems.</p>
