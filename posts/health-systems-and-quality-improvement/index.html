S.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.08.23293789\nEvery year, approximately 200 million surgeries are performed worldwide, and intraoperative adverse events (iAEs) have a significant impact on patients and surgeons. Despite their importance, the true scale of iAEs remains underestimated due to inadequate methods for assessment, collection, grading, and reporting. Various grading systems have been introduced over the past decade, but their adoption has been limited, leading to inconsistencies in reporting. Furthermore, a lack of standardized frameworks for defining, assessing, and collecting iAEs, coupled with litigation concerns, contributes to underreporting. Only half of surgery and anesthesiology journals provide guidance on reporting perioperative adverse events, and recommendations for reporting iAEs are notably lacking in surgical literature. To address these issues, the Intraoperative Complications Assessment and Reporting with Universal Standard (ICARUS) Global Surgical Collaboration was established in 2022. The initiative involves conducting global surveys and a Delphi consensus to understand the barriers for poor reporting of iAEs, validate shared criteria for reporting, define iAEs according to surgical procedures, evaluate the existing grading systems reliability, and identify strategies for enhancing the collection, reporting, and management of iAEs. A sample size of 2,398 respondents was calculated for the study, with invitations extended to 86,574 healthcare providers. This effort represents an essential step towards improved patient safety and the well-being of healthcare professionals in the surgical field.\nChronic Pain and Eye Movements: A NeuroIS Approach to Designing Smart Clinical Decision Support Systems\nAuthors: Alrefaei, D.; Djamasbi, S.; Strong, D.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.04.23293108\nThe pressing need for objective measures in the evaluation of chronic pain both in research and practice highlights the role that neuro information systems (NeuorIS) research plays in designing smart clinical decision support systems. A first step in such a research agenda is identifying practical stimuli-task paradigms that can reliably detect chronic pain from physiological measures such as eye movements. In this study, we propose and test a new stimuli-task paradigm. Our results show that our proposed stimuli-task paradigm can detect differences in information processing behavior of people with and without chronic pain. The results also show that our proposed stimuli-task paradigm can reliably predict a persons reported subjective pain experience from his/her eye movements. These findings provide support for our proposed stimuli-task paradigm. They also show that the eye-tracking variables that we selected to test our proposed paradigm are effective in capturing the impact of chronic pain on visual attention and suggest that eye movements have the potential to serve as reliable biomarkers of chronic pain. In other words, our results provide support for the potential of eye movements to facilitate the development of smart information systems that can detect the presence and/or the severity of chronic pain from an individuals ocular behavior.\nA Scoping Review of Interventions to De-implement Potentially Harmful Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) in Healthcare Settings\nAuthors: Rockwell, M. S.; Oyese, E. G.; Singh, E.; Vinson, M.; Yim, I.; Turner, J. K.; Epling, J. W.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.23293362\nObjectivesPotentially harmful nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) utilization persists at undesirable rates throughout the world. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on interventions to de-implement potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings and to suggest directions for future research. DesignScoping review Data SourcesPubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar (2000-2022) Study SelectionStudies reporting on the effectiveness of interventions to systematically reduce potentially harmful NSAID utilization in healthcare settings. Data ExtractionUsing Covidence systematic review software, we extracted study and intervention characteristics, including the effectiveness of interventions in reducing NSAID utilization. ResultsFrom 7,818 articles initially identified, 68 were included in the review. Most studies took place in European countries (45.6%) or the U.S. (35.3%), with randomized controlled trial as the most common design (55.9%). The majority of studies (76.2%) reported a reduction in the utilization of potentially harmful NSAIDs. Interventions were largely clinician-facing (76.2%) and delivered in primary care (60.2%). Academic detailing, clinical decision support or electronic medical record interventions, performance reports, and pharmacist review were frequent approaches employed. NSAID use was most commonly classified as potentially harmful based on patients age (55.8%) or history of gastrointestinal disorders (47.1%) or kidney disease (38.2%). Only 7.4% of interventions focused on over-the-counter NSAIDs in addition to prescription. Few studies (5.9%) evaluated pain or quality of life following NSAIDs discontinuation. ConclusionMany varied interventions are effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings. Efforts to adapt, scale, and disseminate these interventions are needed. In addition, future interventions should address over-the-counter NSAIDs, which are broadly available and widely used. Evaluating unintended consequences of interventions, including patient-focused outcomes, is another important priority. O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - NSAIDs are overutilized by high-risk patients at persistent rates. Interventions to reduce potentially harmful NSAIDs prescribing and over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs use are needed. C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - More than 50 studies published internationally from 2000 to 2022 (three quarters of those reviewed) reported on interventions effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs. We extracted and summarized characteristics of studies and of interventions to identify research gaps and priorities for future research. C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - In light of the large number of effective interventions on record, implementation and dissemination efforts should be the priority of future work.

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesPotentially harmful nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) utilization persists at undesirable rates throughout the world. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on interventions to de-implement potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings and to suggest directions for future research.

DesignScoping review

Data SourcesPubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar (2000-2022)

Study SelectionStudies reporting on the effectiveness of interventions to systematically reduce potentially harmful NSAID utilization in healthcare settings.

Data ExtractionUsing Covidence systematic review software, we extracted study and intervention characteristics, including the effectiveness of interventions in reducing NSAID utilization.

ResultsFrom 7,818 articles initially identified, 68 were included in the review. Most studies took place in European countries (45.6%) or the U.S. (35.3%), with randomized controlled trial as the most common design (55.9%). The majority of studies (76.2%) reported a reduction in the utilization of potentially harmful NSAIDs. Interventions were largely clinician-facing (76.2%) and delivered in primary care (60.2%). Academic detailing, clinical decision support or electronic medical record interventions, performance reports, and pharmacist review were frequent approaches employed. NSAID use was most commonly classified as potentially harmful based on patients age (55.8%) or history of gastrointestinal disorders (47.1%) or kidney disease (38.2%). Only 7.4% of interventions focused on over-the-counter NSAIDs in addition to prescription. Few studies (5.9%) evaluated pain or quality of life following NSAIDs discontinuation.

ConclusionMany varied interventions are effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings. Efforts to adapt, scale, and disseminate these interventions are needed. In addition, future interventions should address over-the-counter NSAIDs, which are broadly available and widely used. Evaluating unintended consequences of interventions, including patient-focused outcomes, is another important priority.

O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - NSAIDs are overutilized by high-risk patients at persistent rates. Interventions to reduce potentially harmful NSAIDs prescribing and over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs use are needed.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - More than 50 studies published internationally from 2000 to 2022 (three quarters of those reviewed) reported on interventions effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs. We extracted and summarized characteristics of studies and of interventions to identify research gaps and priorities for future research.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - In light of the large number of effective interventions on record, implementation and dissemination efforts should be the priority of future work.
