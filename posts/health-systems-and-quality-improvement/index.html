To accelerate the clinical development of TB vaccines, a directory of clinical trial centres was established in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to assess capacity for conducting late-stage TB vaccine trials. MethodsTB vaccine-related parameters were identified, and trial centres in SSA were identified and prioritized based on whether they had experience with TB or non-TB vaccine trials. A survey was sent to identified centres, and the resulting directory presents their capacity for TB vaccine trials. Centres that deemed themselves eligible for TB vaccine trials also had the option to contribute their information to the survey. This article provides an overview of the TB vaccine clinical trial centre directory, including the number and distribution of centres, their general characteristics, and their experience with prior TB vaccine trials. It includes information on the capacity of the centres, such as laboratory biosafety level, patient support, and community engagement. It also includes a case study to demonstrate how the directory can be used to identify trial centres with specific capabilities needed for a particular TB vaccine trial. ResultsOf the 134 identified centres, 56 responded by providing information. Of these centres, 51 (91%) had phase 3 clinical trial experience and previous TB trials were conducted at 38 centres. Regarding TB vaccine trials, 19 centres conducted prevention of disease trials, 14 conducted prevention of infection trials, and 27 had no experience with TB vaccine clinical trials. From the respondents, 29 centers in South Africa were identified that could potentially conduct TB vaccine trials, followed by Tanzania (5), Kenya (5), Nigeria (3), and Uganda and Ethiopia (2 each). Trial sites in other countries were underrepresented, based on this survey. ConclusionThe establishment of a clinical trial centre directory can provide a basis for decision-making by various stakeholders. Despite some limitations in survey methodology, the findings suggest opportunities for expanding the evaluation of clinical trial capacity in other disease-prevalent countries and continents. Such data would be valuable in further enriching the Clinical Trial Community which a resource that geographically highlights clinical trial investments and capacities in African research ecosystem.
