The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on interventions to de-implement potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings and to suggest directions for future research. DesignScoping review Data SourcesPubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar (2000-2022) Study SelectionStudies reporting on the effectiveness of interventions to systematically reduce potentially harmful NSAID utilization in healthcare settings. Data ExtractionUsing Covidence systematic review software, we extracted study and intervention characteristics, including the effectiveness of interventions in reducing NSAID utilization. ResultsFrom 7,818 articles initially identified, 68 were included in the review. Most studies took place in European countries (45.6%) or the U.S. (35.3%), with randomized controlled trial as the most common design (55.9%). The majority of studies (76.2%) reported a reduction in the utilization of potentially harmful NSAIDs. Interventions were largely clinician-facing (76.2%) and delivered in primary care (60.2%). Academic detailing, clinical decision support or electronic medical record interventions, performance reports, and pharmacist review were frequent approaches employed. NSAID use was most commonly classified as potentially harmful based on patients age (55.8%) or history of gastrointestinal disorders (47.1%) or kidney disease (38.2%). Only 7.4% of interventions focused on over-the-counter NSAIDs in addition to prescription. Few studies (5.9%) evaluated pain or quality of life following NSAIDs discontinuation. ConclusionMany varied interventions are effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs in healthcare settings. Efforts to adapt, scale, and disseminate these interventions are needed. In addition, future interventions should address over-the-counter NSAIDs, which are broadly available and widely used. Evaluating unintended consequences of interventions, including patient-focused outcomes, is another important priority. O_LIWhat is already known on this topic - NSAIDs are overutilized by high-risk patients at persistent rates. Interventions to reduce potentially harmful NSAIDs prescribing and over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs use are needed. C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds - More than 50 studies published internationally from 2000 to 2022 (three quarters of those reviewed) reported on interventions effective in de-implementing potentially harmful NSAIDs. We extracted and summarized characteristics of studies and of interventions to identify research gaps and priorities for future research.

Canadian African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) communities representing some of the most vulnerable populations in terms of their susceptibility to health risks, receipt of adequate care, and chances of recovery. The COVID-19 ACB Providers Project (CAPP 2) aims to strengthen the ability of health care providers (HCP) to address this communitys COVID-19 related healthcare needs. Informed by CAPP 1.0 Project, a mixed-method study which examined COVID-19 pandemic impact on ACB communities in Ontario (Ottawa and Toronto), this second study seeks to develop and implement educational programs on five key areas (modules) to strengthen the capacity of HCPs working with ACB populations. The five modules (topics) include: 1) COVID-19 and its impacts on health, 2) social determinants of health and health inequities, 3) critical health literacy, 4) critical racial literacy, and 5) cultural competence and safety. Methods and analysisAn implementation science approach will guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of the evidence-informed interventions. Intersectionality lens, socio-ecological model (SEM) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) frameworks will inform the research process. To ensure active stakeholder engagement, there will be a Project Advisory Committee comprised of 16 ACB community members, health providers, and partner agency representatives. Five modules will be developed: two virtual simulation games in collaboration with leading simulation experts, and three non-simulation modules. Ethics and disseminationEthics approval was granted by the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board on July 18th, 2023 (H - 01-23 - 8069). The results of this study will be disseminated in community workshops, an online learning platform, at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed publications.\n",
