Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) patients 18 years and older who were vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna formulation of the COVID19 bivalent vaccine between September 1, 2022 and March 1st 2023. Patients were included in the study if they had KP membership at the time of vaccination and through the 21-day follow up period. We replicated the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) rapid cycle analysis methodology and searched for possible cases of ischemic stroke or TIA in the 21 days following vaccination using ICD10CM diagnosis codes in both the primary position and any position. We waited 90 days from the end of the follow up (March 21, 2023) for complete non KP data accrual before analyzing the data to account for the lag in processing outside hospital insurance claims. Two physicians adjudicated possible cases by reviewing the clinical notes in the electronic health record. The analyses were stratified by age 65 years and older to allow for comparisons with VSDs reporting at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting of incidence of ischemic stroke or TIA (VSD reported incidence; 24.6 cases of ischemic stroke or TIA per 100,000 patients vaccinated). Results: The incidence of ischemic stroke or TIA was 34.3 per 100,000 (95% CI, 17.7 to 59.9) in patients 65 years or older who received the bivalent Pfizer vaccine, based on a diagnosis code in the primary position of the emergency department or hospital discharge. The incidence increased to 45.7 per 100,000 (95% CI 26.1 to 74.2) when we expanded the search to a diagnosis in any position and did not adjudicate to confirm. However, most of those additional apparent stroke or TIA diagnoses were false-positive diagnoses based on physicians adjudications. Estimating the incidence based on the primary position agreed closely with estimating the incidence based on any position and physician adjudication: 37.1 per 100,000 (95% CI 19.8 to 63.5). Seventy-nine percent of the ischemic stroke cases were admitted to hospitals that are not owned by the integrated delivery system. Conclusion: We identified a 50% increase in the incidence of ischemic stroke per 100,000 patients ages 65 and older vaccinated with the Pfizer bivalent vaccine, compared to the data presented by the VSD. Seventy-nine percent of the ischemic stroke cases were admitted to hospitals that are not owned by the integrated delivery system and a delay in processing outside hospital insurance claims was likely responsible for the discrepancy in case ascertainment of ischemic stroke. Physician adjudication of all cases in this study allowed accurate absolute incidence estimates of stroke per 100,000 vaccine recipients and is helpful in calculation of net benefit for policy recommendations and shared decision-making.\nACCORD (ACcurate COnsensus Reporting Document): A reporting guideline for consensus methods in biomedicine developed via a modified Delphi\nAuthors: Gattrell, W. T.; Logullo, P.; van Zuuren, E. J.; Price, A.; Hughes, E. L.; Blazey, P.; Winchester, C. C.; Tovey, D.; Goldman, K.; Hungin, A. P.; Harrison, N.\nScore: 12.0, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.23294261\nBackgroundIn biomedical research, it is often desirable to seek consensus among individuals who have differing perspectives and experience. This is important when evidence is emerging, inconsistent, limited or absent. Even when research evidence is abundant, clinical recommendations, policy decisions and priority-setting may still require agreement from multiple, sometimes ideologically opposed parties. Despite their prominence and influence on key decisions, consensus methods are often poorly reported. We aimed to develop the first reporting guideline applicable to all consensus methods used in biomedical research, called ACCORD (ACcurate COnsensus Reporting Document). MethodsWe followed methodology recommended by the EQUATOR Network for the development of reporting guidelines: a systematic review was followed by a Delphi process and meetings to finalise the ACCORD checklist. The preliminary checklist was drawn from the systematic review of existing literature on the quality of reporting of consensus methods and suggestions from the Steering Committee. ResultsA Delphi panel (n=72) was recruited with representation from six continents and a broad range of experience, including clinical, research, policy and patient perspectives. The three rounds of the Delphi process were completed by 58, 54 and 51 panellists. The preliminary checklist of 56 items was refined to a final checklist of 35 items relating to the article title (n=1), introduction (n=3), methods (n=21), results (n=5), discussion (n=2) and other information (n=3). ConclusionsThe ACCORD checklist is the first reporting guideline applicable to all consensus-based studies. It will support authors in writing accurate, detailed manuscripts, thereby improving the completeness and transparency of reporting and providing readers with clarity regarding the methods used to reach agreement. Furthermore, the checklist will make the rigour of the consensus methods used to guide the recommendations clear for readers. Reporting consensus studies with greater clarity and transparency may enhance trust in the recommendations made by consensus panels.\nPatients experience to inform decision-making and clinical follow-up: The example of total hip arthroplasty\nAuthors: Lubbeke, A.; Cullati, S.; Barea, C.; Cole, S.; Fabiano, G.; Silman, A.; Gutacker, N.; Agoritsas, T.; Hannouche, D.; Pinedo-Villanueva, R.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293821\nBackgroundThe aim of this project was to enable patients and clinicians to benefit from previous patients experiences with total hip arthroplasty (THA) by seeking out patients views on what is important for them, leveraging registry data, and providing outcome information that is perceived as relevant, understandable, adapted to a specific patients profile, and readily available. MethodsWe created the information tool \"Patients like me\" in four steps. (1) The knowledge basis was the systematically collected detailed exposure and outcome information from the Geneva Arthroplasty Registry established 1996. (2) From the registry we randomly selected 275 patients about to undergo or having already undergone THA and asked them via interviews and a survey which benefits and harms associated with the operation and daily life with the prosthesis they perceived as most important. (3) The identified relevant data (39 predictor candidates, 15 outcomes) were evaluated using Conditional Inference Trees analysis to construct a classification algorithm for each of the 15 outcomes at three different time points/periods. Internal validity of the results was tested using bootstrapping. (4) The tool was designed by and pre-tested with patients over several iterations. ResultsData from 6836 primary elective THAs operated between 1996 and 2019 were included. The trajectories for the 15 outcomes from the domains pain relief, activity improvement, complication (infection, dislocation, peri-prosthetic fracture) and what to expect in the future (revision surgery, need for contralateral hip replacement) over up to 20 years after surgery were presented for all patients and for specific patient profiles. The tool was adapted to various purposes including individual use, group sessions, patient-clinician interaction and surgeon information to complement the preoperative planning. The pre-test patients feedback to the tool was unanimously positive. They considered it interesting, clear, complete, and complementary to other information received. ConclusionThe tool basead on a survey of patients perceived concerns and interests and the corresponding long-term data from a large institutional registry makes past patients experience accessible, understandable, and visible for todays patients and their clinicians. It is a comprehensive illustration of trajectories of relevant outcomes from previous \"Patients like me\". This principle and methodology can be applied in other medical fields.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundIn biomedical research, it is often desirable to seek consensus among individuals who have differing perspectives and experience. This is important when evidence is emerging, inconsistent, limited or absent. Even when research evidence is abundant, clinical recommendations, policy decisions and priority-setting may still require agreement from multiple, sometimes ideologically opposed parties. Despite their prominence and influence on key decisions, consensus methods are often poorly reported. We aimed to develop the first reporting guideline applicable to all consensus methods used in biomedical research, called ACCORD (ACcurate COnsensus Reporting Document).

MethodsWe followed methodology recommended by the EQUATOR Network for the development of reporting guidelines: a systematic review was followed by a Delphi process and meetings to finalise the ACCORD checklist. The preliminary checklist was drawn from the systematic review of existing literature on the quality of reporting of consensus methods and suggestions from the Steering Committee.

ResultsA Delphi panel (n=72) was recruited with representation from six continents and a broad range of experience, including clinical, research, policy and patient perspectives. The three rounds of the Delphi process were completed by 58, 54 and 51 panellists. The preliminary checklist of 56 items was refined to a final checklist of 35 items relating to the article title (n=1), introduction (n=3), methods (n=21), results (n=5), discussion (n=2) and other information (n=3).

ConclusionsThe ACCORD checklist is the first reporting guideline applicable to all consensus-based studies. It will support authors in writing accurate, detailed manuscripts, thereby improving the completeness and transparency of reporting and providing readers with clarity regarding the methods used to reach agreement. Furthermore, the checklist will make the rigour of the consensus methods used to guide the recommendations clear for readers. Reporting consensus studies with greater clarity and transparency may enhance trust in the recommendations made by consensus panels.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundThe aim of this project was to enable patients and clinicians to benefit from previous patients experiences with total hip arthroplasty (THA) by seeking out patients views on what is important for them, leveraging registry data, and providing outcome information that is perceived as relevant, understandable, adapted to a specific patients profile, and readily available.

MethodsWe created the information tool &#34;Patients like me&#34; in four steps. (1) The knowledge basis was the systematically collected detailed exposure and outcome information from the Geneva Arthroplasty Registry established 1996. (2) From the registry we randomly selected 275 patients about to undergo or having already undergone THA and asked them via interviews and a survey which benefits and harms associated with the operation and daily life with the prosthesis they perceived as most important. (3) The identified relevant data (39 predictor candidates, 15 outcomes) were evaluated using Conditional Inference Trees analysis to construct a classification algorithm for each of the 15 outcomes at three different time points/periods. Internal validity of the results was tested using bootstrapping. (4) The tool was designed by and pre-tested with patients over several iterations.

ResultsData from 6836 primary elective THAs operated between 1996 and 2019 were included. The trajectories for the 15 outcomes from the domains pain relief, activity improvement, complication (infection, dislocation, peri-prosthetic fracture) and what to expect in the future (revision surgery, need for contralateral hip replacement) over up to 20 years after surgery were presented for all patients and for specific patient profiles. The tool was adapted to various purposes including individual use, group sessions, patient-clinician interaction and surgeon information to complement the preoperative planning. The pre-test patients feedback to the tool was unanimously positive. They considered it interesting, clear, complete, and complementary to other information received.

ConclusionThe tool basead on a survey of patients perceived concerns and interests and the corresponding long-term data from a large institutional registry makes past patients experience accessible, understandable, and visible for todays patients and their clinicians. It is a comprehensive illustration of trajectories of relevant outcomes from previous &#34;Patients like me&#34;. This principle and methodology can be applied in other medical fields.</p>
