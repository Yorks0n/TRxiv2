A.; Sezgin, E.; Lyman, E.; Levental, K. R.; Levental, I.\nScore: 111.0, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551157\nMembranes are molecular interfaces that insulate cells from external stresses, compartmentalize the cytoplasm, and control the flow of nutrients and information1. These functions are facilitated by diverse collections of lipids, nearly all of which are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of living bilayers2,3. Previous models of biomembrane structure and function have rested upon the implicit assumption that the two membrane leaflets have similar abundances of phospholipids. Here, we show that this assumption is generally invalid and investigate the consequences of lipid abundance imbalances in mammalian plasma membranes (PM). Using quantitative lipidomics, we discovered that cytoplasmic leaflets of human erythrocyte PMs have \u003e50% overabundance of phospholipids compared to exoplasmic leaflets. We show that this phospholipid imbalance is enabled by an asymmetric interleaflet distribution of cholesterol4,5, which rapidly redistributes to buffer leaflet stresses. Asymmetric phospholipid abundance and composition combine to enrich cholesterol in the exoplasmic PM leaflet. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches we demonstrate how these lipid distributions impart unique functional characteristics to PMs, including low permeability, surprisingly fast cholesterol diffusion6, and resting tension in the cytoplasmic monolayer that regulates protein localization. Our observations of these previously overlooked aspects of membrane asymmetry represent an evolution of classic paradigms1,7 of biomembrane structure and physiology.\nReliable protein-protein docking with AlphaFold, Rosetta and replica-exchange\nAuthors: Harmalkar, A.; Lyskov, S.; Gray, J. J.\nScore: 67.8, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551063\nDespite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners. Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases. 1 In this work, we combine AlphaFold as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol 2 to complete a robust in-silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 66% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (19% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 51%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep-learning based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling. The pipeline is available at github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED.\nSquare beams for optimal tiling in TEM\nAuthors: Chua, E. Y. D.; Alink, L. M.; Kopylov, M.; de Marco, A.\nScore: 43.9, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551095\nImaging large fields-of-view at a high magnification requires tiling. Transmission electron microscopes typically have round beam profiles; therefore, tiling across a large field-of-view is either imperfect or results in uneven exposures, which is a problem on dose-sensitive samples. Here we introduce a square electron beam that can be easily retrofitted in existing microscopes and demonstrate its application showing it can title nearly perfectly and deliver cryo-EM imaging with resolution comparable to conventional setups.\nMechanical control of cell proliferation patterns in growing tissues\nAuthors: Carpenter, L. C.; Perez-Verdugo, F.; Banerjee, S.\nScore: 29.4, Published: 2023-07-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550581\nCell proliferation plays a crucial role in regulating tissue homeostasis and development. However, our understanding of how cell proliferation is controlled in densely packed tissues is limited. Here we develop a computational framework to predict the patterns of cell proliferation in growing tissues, connecting single-cell behaviors and cell-cell interactions to tissue-level growth. Our model incorporates probabilistic rules governing cell growth, division, and elimination, while also taking into account their feedback with tissue mechanics. In particular, cell growth is suppressed and apoptosis is enhanced in regions of high cell density. With these rules and model parameters calibrated using experimental data, we predict how tissue confinement influences cell size and proliferation dynamics, and how single-cell physical properties influence the spatiotemporal patterns of tissue growth. Our findings indicate that mechanical feedback between tissue confinement and cell growth leads to enhanced cell proliferation at tissue boundaries, whereas cell growth in the bulk is arrested. By tuning cellular elasticity and contact inhibition of proliferation we can regulate the emergent patterns of cell proliferation, ranging from uniform growth at low contact inhibition to localized growth at higher contact inhibition. Furthermore, mechanical state of the tissue governs the dynamics of tissue growth, with cellular parameters affecting tissue pressure playing a significant role in determining the overall growth rate. Our computational study thus underscores the impact of cell mechanical properties on the spatiotemporal patterns of cell proliferation in growing tissues.\nGraph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP): Identifying Druggable Binding Sites Using Graph Neural Networks with Attention\nAuthors: Smith, Z.; Strobel, M.; Vani, B.; Tiwary, P.\nScore: 39.1, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550565\nIdentifying and discovering druggable protein binding sites is an important early step in computer-aided drug discovery but remains a difficult task where most campaigns rely on a priori knowledge of binding sites from experiments. Here we present a novel binding site prediction method called Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) and re-evaluate assumptions in nearly every step in the site prediction workflow from dataset preparation to model evaluation. GrASP is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance at recovering binding sites in PDB structures while maintaining a high degree of precision which will minimize wasted computation in downstream tasks such as docking and free energy perturbation.\nThinner is not always better: Optimising cryo lamellae for subtomogram averaging\nAuthors: Tuijtel, M. W.; Kreysing, J. P.; Welsch, S.; Hummer, G.; Beck, M.; Turonova, B.\nScore: 23.5, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551274\nCryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to elucidate subcellular architecture and to structurally analyse biomolecules in situ by subtomogram averaging (STA). Specimen thickness is a key factor affecting cryo-ET data quality. Cells that are too thick for transmission imaging can be thinned by cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling. However, optimal specimen thickness for cryo-ET on lamellae has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, the ions used to ablate material can cause damage in the lamellae, thereby reducing STA resolution. Here, we systematically benchmark the resolution depending on lamella thickness and the depth of the particles within the sample. Up to ca. 180 nm, lamella thickness does not negatively impact resolution. This shows that there is no need to generate very thin lamellae and thickness can be chosen such that it captures major cellular features. Furthermore, we show that gallium-ion-induced damage extends to depths of up to 30 nm from either lamella surface.\nAlphaFold2 modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of an intrinsically disordered protein\nAuthors: Guo, H.-B.; Huntington, B.; Perminov, A.; Smith, K.; Hastings, N.; Dennis, P.; Kelley-Loughnane, N.; Berry, R. J.\nScore: 9.7, Published: 2023-07-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.29.551023\nWe use AlphaFold2 (AF2) to model the monomer and dimer structures of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), Nvjp-1, assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observe relatively rigid dimeric structures of Nvjp-1 when compared with the monomer structures. We suggest that protein conformations from multiple AF2 models and those from MD trajectories exhibit a coherent trend: the conformations of an IDP are deviated from each other and the conformations of a well-folded protein are consistent with each other. We use a residue-residue interaction network (RIN) derived from the contact map which show that the residue-residue interactions in Nvjp-1 are mainly transient; however, those in a well-folded protein are mainly persistent. Despite the variation in 3D shapes, we show that the AF2 models of both disordered and ordered proteins exhibit highly consistent profiles of the pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) scores. These results indicate a potential protocol to justify the IDPs based on multiple AF2 models and MD simulations.

Z.; Kuhlman, B.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551328\nProtein side chain packing (PSCP) is a fundamental problem in the field of protein engineering, as high confidence and low energy conformations of amino acid side chains are crucial for understanding (and designing) protein folding, protein-protein interactions, and protein-ligand interactions. Traditional PSCP methods (such as the Rosetta Packer) often rely on a library of discrete side chain conformations, or rotamers, and a forcefield to guide the structure to low energy conformations. Recently, deep learning (DL) based methods (such as DLPacker, AttnPacker, and DiffPack) have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictions and speed in the PSCP task. Building off the success of graph and message passing neural networks for protein modeling, we present the Protein Invariant Point Packer (PIPPack) which effectively processes local structural and sequence information to produce realistic, idealized side chain coordinates using -angle distribution predictions and geometry-aware invariant point message passing (IPMP). To demonstrate its broad applicability to protein-related tasks, IPMP was additionally incorporated in a fixed backbone protein design method, which enabled the generation of more native-like sequences than common message passing schemes. On a test set of [~]1,400 high-quality protein chains, PIPPack performs competitively with other state-of-the-art PSCP methods in rotamer recovery and per-residue RMSDs but is significantly faster.\nTheory of sarcomere assembly inferred from sequential ordering of myofibril components\nAuthors: Kolley, F.; Sidor, C.; Dehapiot, B.; Schnorrer, F.; Friedrich, B. M.\nScore: 8.3, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551279\nMyofibrils in striated muscle cells are chains of regular cytoskeletal units termed sarcomeres, whose contractions drive voluntary movements of animals. Despite the well characterized order of the sarcomere components in mature sarcomeres, which explains the sarcomere contraction mechanism, the mechanism of molecular ordering during sarcomere assembly remains debated. Here, we put forward a theoretical framework for the self-assembly of sarcomeres. This theory is based on measurements of the sequential ordering of sarcomere components in developing Drosophila flight muscles, identified by applying a novel tracking-free algorithm: myosin, -actinin and the titin homologue Sallimus form periodic patterns before actin. Based on these results, we propose that myosin, Sallimus, and sarcomere Z-disc proteins including -actinin dynamically bind and unbind to an unordered bundle of actin filaments to establish an initial periodic pattern. As a consequence, periodicity of actin filaments is only established later. Our model proposes that non-local interactions between spatially extended myosin and titin/Sallimus containing complexes, and possibly tension-dependent feedback mediated by an -actinin catch-bond, drive this ordering process. We probe this hypothesis using mathematical models and derive predictive conditions for sarcomere pattern formation, guiding future experimental analysis.\nMechano-induced homotypic patterned domain formation by monocytes\nAuthors: Du, W.; Zhu, J.; Wu, Y.; Kiemen, A.; Sun, S.; Wirtz, D.\nScore: 26.7, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.550819\nMatrix stiffness and corresponding mechano-signaling play indispensable roles in cellular phenotypes and functions. How tissue stiffness influences the behavior of monocytes, a major circulating leukocyte of the innate system, and how it may promote the emergence of collective cell behavior is less understood. Here, using tunable collagen-coated hydrogels of physiological stiffness, we show that human primary monocytes undergo a dynamic local phase separation to form highly patterned multicellular multi-layered domains on soft matrix. Local activation of the {beta}2 integrin initiates inter-cellular adhesion, while global soluble inhibitory factors maintain the steady-state domain pattern over days. Patterned domain formation generated by monocytes is unique among other key immune cells, including macrophages, B cells, T cells, and NK cells. While inhibiting their phagocytic capability, domain formation promotes monocytes survival. We develop a computational model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which includes combined local activation and global inhibition mechanisms of intercellular adhesion suggested by our experiments, and provides experimentally validated predictions of the role of seeding density and both chemotactic and random cell migration on pattern formation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Membranes are molecular interfaces that insulate cells from external stresses, compartmentalize the cytoplasm, and control the flow of nutrients and information1. These functions are facilitated by diverse collections of lipids, nearly all of which are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of living bilayers2,3. Previous models of biomembrane structure and function have rested upon the implicit assumption that the two membrane leaflets have similar abundances of phospholipids. Here, we show that this assumption is generally invalid and investigate the consequences of lipid abundance imbalances in mammalian plasma membranes (PM). Using quantitative lipidomics, we discovered that cytoplasmic leaflets of human erythrocyte PMs have &gt;50% overabundance of phospholipids compared to exoplasmic leaflets. We show that this phospholipid imbalance is enabled by an asymmetric interleaflet distribution of cholesterol4,5, which rapidly redistributes to buffer leaflet stresses. Asymmetric phospholipid abundance and composition combine to enrich cholesterol in the exoplasmic PM leaflet. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches we demonstrate how these lipid distributions impart unique functional characteristics to PMs, including low permeability, surprisingly fast cholesterol diffusion6, and resting tension in the cytoplasmic monolayer that regulates protein localization. Our observations of these previously overlooked aspects of membrane asymmetry represent an evolution of classic paradigms1,7 of biomembrane structure and physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners. Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases. 1 In this work, we combine AlphaFold as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol 2 to complete a robust in-silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 66% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (19% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 51%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep-learning based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling. The pipeline is available at github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Imaging large fields-of-view at a high magnification requires tiling. Transmission electron microscopes typically have round beam profiles; therefore, tiling across a large field-of-view is either imperfect or results in uneven exposures, which is a problem on dose-sensitive samples. Here we introduce a square electron beam that can be easily retrofitted in existing microscopes and demonstrate its application showing it can title nearly perfectly and deliver cryo-EM imaging with resolution comparable to conventional setups.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell proliferation plays a crucial role in regulating tissue homeostasis and development. However, our understanding of how cell proliferation is controlled in densely packed tissues is limited. Here we develop a computational framework to predict the patterns of cell proliferation in growing tissues, connecting single-cell behaviors and cell-cell interactions to tissue-level growth. Our model incorporates probabilistic rules governing cell growth, division, and elimination, while also taking into account their feedback with tissue mechanics. In particular, cell growth is suppressed and apoptosis is enhanced in regions of high cell density. With these rules and model parameters calibrated using experimental data, we predict how tissue confinement influences cell size and proliferation dynamics, and how single-cell physical properties influence the spatiotemporal patterns of tissue growth. Our findings indicate that mechanical feedback between tissue confinement and cell growth leads to enhanced cell proliferation at tissue boundaries, whereas cell growth in the bulk is arrested. By tuning cellular elasticity and contact inhibition of proliferation we can regulate the emergent patterns of cell proliferation, ranging from uniform growth at low contact inhibition to localized growth at higher contact inhibition. Furthermore, mechanical state of the tissue governs the dynamics of tissue growth, with cellular parameters affecting tissue pressure playing a significant role in determining the overall growth rate. Our computational study thus underscores the impact of cell mechanical properties on the spatiotemporal patterns of cell proliferation in growing tissues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Identifying and discovering druggable protein binding sites is an important early step in computer-aided drug discovery but remains a difficult task where most campaigns rely on a priori knowledge of binding sites from experiments. Here we present a novel binding site prediction method called Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) and re-evaluate assumptions in nearly every step in the site prediction workflow from dataset preparation to model evaluation. GrASP is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance at recovering binding sites in PDB structures while maintaining a high degree of precision which will minimize wasted computation in downstream tasks such as docking and free energy perturbation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to elucidate subcellular architecture and to structurally analyse biomolecules in situ by subtomogram averaging (STA). Specimen thickness is a key factor affecting cryo-ET data quality. Cells that are too thick for transmission imaging can be thinned by cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling. However, optimal specimen thickness for cryo-ET on lamellae has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, the ions used to ablate material can cause damage in the lamellae, thereby reducing STA resolution. Here, we systematically benchmark the resolution depending on lamella thickness and the depth of the particles within the sample. Up to ca. 180 nm, lamella thickness does not negatively impact resolution. This shows that there is no need to generate very thin lamellae and thickness can be chosen such that it captures major cellular features. Furthermore, we show that gallium-ion-induced damage extends to depths of up to 30 nm from either lamella surface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We use AlphaFold2 (AF2) to model the monomer and dimer structures of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), Nvjp-1, assisted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observe relatively rigid dimeric structures of Nvjp-1 when compared with the monomer structures. We suggest that protein conformations from multiple AF2 models and those from MD trajectories exhibit a coherent trend: the conformations of an IDP are deviated from each other and the conformations of a well-folded protein are consistent with each other. We use a residue-residue interaction network (RIN) derived from the contact map which show that the residue-residue interactions in Nvjp-1 are mainly transient; however, those in a well-folded protein are mainly persistent. Despite the variation in 3D shapes, we show that the AF2 models of both disordered and ordered proteins exhibit highly consistent profiles of the pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) scores. These results indicate a potential protocol to justify the IDPs based on multiple AF2 models and MD simulations.

        <p class="abstract">Protein side chain packing (PSCP) is a fundamental problem in the field of protein engineering, as high confidence and low energy conformations of amino acid side chains are crucial for understanding (and designing) protein folding, protein-protein interactions, and protein-ligand interactions. Traditional PSCP methods (such as the Rosetta Packer) often rely on a library of discrete side chain conformations, or rotamers, and a forcefield to guide the structure to low energy conformations. Recently, deep learning (DL) based methods (such as DLPacker, AttnPacker, and DiffPack) have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictions and speed in the PSCP task. Building off the success of graph and message passing neural networks for protein modeling, we present the Protein Invariant Point Packer (PIPPack) which effectively processes local structural and sequence information to produce realistic, idealized side chain coordinates using -angle distribution predictions and geometry-aware invariant point message passing (IPMP). To demonstrate its broad applicability to protein-related tasks, IPMP was additionally incorporated in a fixed backbone protein design method, which enabled the generation of more native-like sequences than common message passing schemes. On a test set of [~]1,400 high-quality protein chains, PIPPack performs competitively with other state-of-the-art PSCP methods in rotamer recovery and per-residue RMSDs but is significantly faster.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myofibrils in striated muscle cells are chains of regular cytoskeletal units termed sarcomeres, whose contractions drive voluntary movements of animals. Despite the well characterized order of the sarcomere components in mature sarcomeres, which explains the sarcomere contraction mechanism, the mechanism of molecular ordering during sarcomere assembly remains debated. Here, we put forward a theoretical framework for the self-assembly of sarcomeres. This theory is based on measurements of the sequential ordering of sarcomere components in developing Drosophila flight muscles, identified by applying a novel tracking-free algorithm: myosin, -actinin and the titin homologue Sallimus form periodic patterns before actin. Based on these results, we propose that myosin, Sallimus, and sarcomere Z-disc proteins including -actinin dynamically bind and unbind to an unordered bundle of actin filaments to establish an initial periodic pattern. As a consequence, periodicity of actin filaments is only established later. Our model proposes that non-local interactions between spatially extended myosin and titin/Sallimus containing complexes, and possibly tension-dependent feedback mediated by an -actinin catch-bond, drive this ordering process. We probe this hypothesis using mathematical models and derive predictive conditions for sarcomere pattern formation, guiding future experimental analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Matrix stiffness and corresponding mechano-signaling play indispensable roles in cellular phenotypes and functions. How tissue stiffness influences the behavior of monocytes, a major circulating leukocyte of the innate system, and how it may promote the emergence of collective cell behavior is less understood. Here, using tunable collagen-coated hydrogels of physiological stiffness, we show that human primary monocytes undergo a dynamic local phase separation to form highly patterned multicellular multi-layered domains on soft matrix. Local activation of the {beta}2 integrin initiates inter-cellular adhesion, while global soluble inhibitory factors maintain the steady-state domain pattern over days. Patterned domain formation generated by monocytes is unique among other key immune cells, including macrophages, B cells, T cells, and NK cells. While inhibiting their phagocytic capability, domain formation promotes monocytes survival. We develop a computational model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which includes combined local activation and global inhibition mechanisms of intercellular adhesion suggested by our experiments, and provides experimentally validated predictions of the role of seeding density and both chemotactic and random cell migration on pattern formation.</p>
