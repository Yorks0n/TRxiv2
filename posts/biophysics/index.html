J.; Goerlach, E.; O'Neill, G. M.; Budday, S.; Strissel, P.; Strick, R.; Malandrino, A.; Gerum, R.; Mak, M.; Rausch, M.; Fabry, B.\nScore: 30.1, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546896\nCells cultured in 3D fibrous biopolymer matrices exert traction forces on their environment that induce deformations and remodeling of the fiber network. By measuring these deformations, the traction forces can be reconstructed if the mechanical properties of the matrix and the force-free matrix configuration are known. These requirements severely limit the applicability of traction force reconstruction in practice. In this study, we test whether force-induced matrix remodeling can instead be used as a proxy for cellular traction forces. We measure the traction forces of hepatic stellate cells and different glioblastoma cell lines and quantify matrix remodeling by measuring the fiber orientation and fiber density around these cells. In agreement with simulated fiber networks, we demonstrate that changes in local fiber orientation and density are directly related to cell forces. By resolving Rho-kinase (ROCK) Inhibitor-induced changes of traction forces and fiber alignment and density in hepatic stellate cells, we show that the method is suitable for drug screening assays. We conclude that differences in local fiber orientation and density, which are easily measurable, can be used as a qualitative proxy for changes in traction forces. The method is available as an open-source Python package with a graphical user interface.\nAdhesion energy controls lipid binding-mediated endocytosis\nAuthors: Groza, R.; Schmidt, K. V.; Muller, P. M.; Ronchi, P.; Schlack-Leigers, C.; Neu, U.; Puchkov, D.; Dimova, R.; Matthaus, C.; Taraska, J. W.; Weikl, T.; Ewers, H.\nScore: 26.2, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.23.546235\nSeveral bacterial toxins and viruses can deform membranes through multivalent binding to lipids for clathrin-independent endocytosis. However, it remains unclear, how membrane deformation and endocytic internalization are mechanistically linked. Here we show that many lipid-binding virions induce membrane deformation and clathrin-independent endocytosis, suggesting a common mechanism based on multivalent lipid binding by globular particles. We create a synthetic cellular system consisting of a lipid-anchored receptor in the form of GPI-anchored anti-GFP nanobodies and a multivalent globular binder exposing 180 regularly-spaced GFP molecules on its surface. We show that these globular, 40 nm diameter, particles bind to cells expressing the receptor, deform the plasma membrane upon adhesion and become endocytosed in a clathrin-independent manner. We explore the role of the membrane adhesion energy in endocytosis by using receptors with affinities varying over 7 orders of magnitude. Using this system, we find that once a threshold in adhesion energy is overcome to allow for membrane deformation, endocytosis occurs reliably. Multivalent, binding-induced membrane deformation by globular binders is thus sufficient for internalization to occur and we suggest it is the common, purely biophysical mechanism for lipid-binding mediated endocytosis of toxins and pathogens.\nUncovering Protein Ensembles: Automated Multiconformer Model Building for X-ray Crystallography and Cryo-EM\nAuthors: Wankowicz, S. A.; Ravikumar, A.; Sharma, S.; Riley, B.; Raju, A.; Hogan, D. W.; van den Bedem, H.; Keedy, D. A.; Fraser, J. S.\nScore: 24.5, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546963\nWith the advent of AlphaFold, protein structure prediction has attained remarkable accuracy. These achievements resulted from a focus on single static structures. The next frontier in this field involves enhancing our ability to model conformational ensembles, not just the ground states of proteins. Notably, deposited structures result from interpretation of density maps, which are derived from either X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These maps represent ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in multiple conformations. Here, we present the latest developments in qFit, an automated computational approach to model protein conformational heterogeneity into density maps. We present algorithmic advancements to qFit, validated by improved Rfree and geometry metrics across a broad and diverse set of proteins. Automated multiconformer modeling holds significant promise for interpreting experimental structural biology data and for generating novel hypotheses linking macromolecular conformational dynamics to function.\nDynamic ParB-DNA interactions initiate and maintain a partition condensate for bacterial chromosome segregation\nAuthors: Tisma, M.; Janissen, R.; Antar, H.; Martin Gonzalez, A.; Barth, R.; Beekman, T.; van der Torre, J.; Michieletto, D.; Gruber, S.; Dekker, C.\nScore: 20.1, Published: 2023-06-25 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.25.546419\nIn most bacteria, chromosome segregation is driven by the ParABS system where the CTPase protein ParB loads at the parS site to trigger the formation of a large partition complex. Here, we present in vitro studies of the partition complex for Bacillus subtilis ParB, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and AFM imaging to show that transient ParB-ParB bridges are essential for forming DNA condensates. Molecular Dynamics simulations confirm that condensation occurs abruptly at a critical concentration of ParB and show that multimerization is a prerequisite for forming the partition complex. Magnetic tweezer force spectroscopy on mutant ParB proteins demonstrates that CTP hydrolysis at the N-terminal domain is essential for DNA condensation. Finally, we show that transcribing RNA polymerases can steadily traverse the ParB-DNA partition complex. These findings uncover how ParB forms a stable yet dynamic partition complex for chromosome segregation that induces DNA condensation and segregation while enabling replication and transcription.\nLipid droplets as substrates for protein phase separation\nAuthors: Kamatar, A.; Bravo, J. P. K.; Yuan, F.; Wang, L.; Lafer, E. M.; Taylor, D. W.; Stachowiak, J.; Parekh, S. H.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546804\nMembrane-associated protein phase separation plays critical roles in cell biology, driving essential cellular phenomena from immune signaling to membrane traffic. Importantly, by restricting diffusion to a two-dimensional surface, lipid bilayers can nucleate phase separation at far lower concentrations compared to those required for phase separation in solution. How might other intracellular lipid substrates, such as lipid droplets, contribute to nucleation of phase separation? Distinct from bilayer membranes, lipid droplets consist of a phospholipid monolayer surrounding a core of neutral lipids, and they are energy storage organelles that protect cells from lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered proteins can undergo phase separation on the surface of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets. Specifically, we find that model disordered domains, FUS LC and LAF1-RGG, separate into protein-rich and protein-depleted phases on the surfaces of lipid droplets. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of interactions between FUS LC proteins, increasing ionic strength drives an increase in its phase separation on droplet surfaces. The opposite is true for LAF1-RGG, owing to the electrostatic nature of its interprotein interactions. In both cases, protein-rich phases on the surfaces of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets demonstrate molecular mobility indicative of a liquid-like state. Our results show that lipid droplets can nucleate protein condensates, suggesting that protein phase separation could be key in organizing biological processes involving lipid droplets.\nAssembly of tight junction belts by surface condensation and actin elongation\nAuthors: Sun, D.; Zhao, X.; Wiegand, T.; Bartolucci, G.; Martin-Lemaitre, C.; Grill, S. W.; Hyman, A. A.; Weber, C.; Honigmann, A.\nScore: 12.8, Published: 2023-06-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.24.546380\nFormation of biomolecular condensates via phase separation enables compartmentation of many cellular processes. However, how cells can control condensation at specific locations to create complex cellular structures remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of tight junction formation, which involves condensation of scaffold proteins at cell-cell contacts and elongation of the condensates into a belt around the cellular perimeter. Using cell biology, reconstitution, and thermodynamic theory, we discovered that cells use surface phase transitions to control local condensation at the membrane far below bulk saturation. Surface condensation of junctional ZO-scaffold proteins is mediated by receptor binding and regulated by the receptors oligomerization state. Functionally, ZO surface condensation is directly coupled to actin polymerization and bundling, which drives elongation of receptor-ZO-actin condensates similar to tight junction belt formation in cells. We conclude that surface phase transitions provide a robust mechanism to control the position and shape of protein condensates. One-Sentence SummaryLocal surface binding of cytosolic scaffold proteins provides spatial control of protein condensation to assemble adhesion junctions.\nDirect observation of autoubiquitination for an integral membrane ubiquitin ligase in ERAD\nAuthors: Moochickal Assainar, B.; Ragunathan, K.; Baldridge, R.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-06-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.20.545802\nThe endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway regulates protein quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum. ERAD of lumenal and membrane proteins requires a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase, called Hrd1. We do not understand the molecular configurations of Hrd1 that enable autoubiquitination and the subsequent retrotranslocation of misfolded protein substrates from the ER to the cytosol. Here, we have established a generalizable, single-molecule platform that enables high-efficiency labeling, stoichiometry determination, and functional assays for any integral membrane protein. Using this approach, we directly count Hrd1 proteins reconstituted into individual proteoliposomes. We found that Hrd1 assembles in different oligomeric configurations with mostly monomers and dimers detected at limiting dilution. By correlating oligomeric states with ubiquitination in vitro, we determined that Hrd1 monomers were incapable of autoubiquitination while dimers efficiently assembled polyubiquitin chains. Therefore, our results reveal the minimal composition of a Hrd1 oligomer that is capable of autoubiquitination. Our methods are broadly applicable to studying other complex membrane protein functions using reconstituted bilayer systems.\nZero-mode waveguide nanowells for single-molecule detection in living cells\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Klughammer, N.; Barth, A.; Tanenbaum, M. E.; Dekker, C.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546504\nSingle-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments generally require sub-nanomolar protein concentrations to isolate single protein molecules, which makes such experiments challenging in live cells due to high intracellular protein concentrations. Here, we show that single-molecule observations can be achieved in live cells through a drastic reduction in the observation volume using overmilled zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs - subwavelength-size holes in a metal film). Overmilling of the ZMW in a palladium film creates a nanowell of tunable size in the glass layer below the aperture, which cells can penetrate. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental characterization of the optical properties of these nanowells over a wide range of ZMW diameters and overmilling depths, showing an excellent signal confinement and a five-fold fluorescence enhancement of fluorescent molecules inside nanowells. ZMW nanowells facilitate live-cell imaging, as cells form stable protrusions into the nanowells. Importantly, the nanowells greatly reduce cytoplasmic background fluorescence, enabling detection of individual membrane-bound fluorophores in the presence of high cytoplasmic expression levels, which could not be achieved with TIRF microscopy. Zero-mode waveguide nanowells thus provide great potential to study individual proteins in living cells.

M.; Park, P.; Koren, S. A.; Hayward, R. F.; Cohen, A. E.\nScore: 9.3, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.27.546633\nCyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger that mediates diverse intracellular signals. Studies of cAMP transport in cells have produced wildly different results, from reports of nearly free diffusion to reports that cAMP remains localized in nanometer-scale domains. We developed an all-optical toolkit, termed cAMP-SITES, to locally perturb and map cAMP transport. In MDCK cells and in cultured neurons, cAMP had a diffusion coefficient of ~120 m2/s, similar to the diffusion coefficients of other small molecules in cytoplasm. In neuronal dendrites, a balance between diffusion and degradation led to cAMP domains with a length scale of ~30 m. Geometrical confinement by membranes led to subcellular variations in cAMP concentration, but we found no evidence of nanoscale domains or of distinct membrane-local and cytoplasmic pools. We introduce theoretical relations between cell geometry and small-molecule reaction-diffusion dynamics and transport to explain our observations.\nLoop-extruders alter bacterial chromosome topology to direct entropic forces for segregation\nAuthors: Harju, J.; van Teeseling, M. C. F.; Broedersz, C. P.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547230\nEntropic forces have been argued to allow bacteria to segregate their chromosomes during replication. In many bacterial species, however, specifically evolved mechanisms, such as loop-extruding SMC complexes and the ParABS origin segregation system, are required for chromosome segregation, suggesting that entropic forces alone may be insufficient. The interplay between and the relative contributions of these segregation mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop a biophysical model showing that purely entropic forces actually inhibit bacterial chromosome segregation until late replication stages. By contrast, we find that loop-extruders loaded at the origins of replication, as found in many bacterial species, alter the effective topology of the chromosome, thereby redirecting and enhancing entropic forces to enable accurate chromosome segregation concurrent with replication. In addition, our model indicates that locally acting origin separation mechanisms, such as the ParABS system, cannot redirect segregation-inhibiting entropic forces. We confirm our predictions with 3D simulations of a replicating polymer: purely entropic forces do not allow for concurrent replication and segregation; entropic forces steered by loop-extruders loaded at the origin lead to robust, global chromosome segregation; and origin separation alone is effective at early replication stages, but does not fully segregate terminal regions. Together, our results illustrate how entropic forces and loop-extrusion play synergistic roles during bacterial chromosome segregation, whereas locally acting mechanisms serve a complementary function.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cells cultured in 3D fibrous biopolymer matrices exert traction forces on their environment that induce deformations and remodeling of the fiber network. By measuring these deformations, the traction forces can be reconstructed if the mechanical properties of the matrix and the force-free matrix configuration are known. These requirements severely limit the applicability of traction force reconstruction in practice. In this study, we test whether force-induced matrix remodeling can instead be used as a proxy for cellular traction forces. We measure the traction forces of hepatic stellate cells and different glioblastoma cell lines and quantify matrix remodeling by measuring the fiber orientation and fiber density around these cells. In agreement with simulated fiber networks, we demonstrate that changes in local fiber orientation and density are directly related to cell forces. By resolving Rho-kinase (ROCK) Inhibitor-induced changes of traction forces and fiber alignment and density in hepatic stellate cells, we show that the method is suitable for drug screening assays. We conclude that differences in local fiber orientation and density, which are easily measurable, can be used as a qualitative proxy for changes in traction forces. The method is available as an open-source Python package with a graphical user interface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Several bacterial toxins and viruses can deform membranes through multivalent binding to lipids for clathrin-independent endocytosis. However, it remains unclear, how membrane deformation and endocytic internalization are mechanistically linked. Here we show that many lipid-binding virions induce membrane deformation and clathrin-independent endocytosis, suggesting a common mechanism based on multivalent lipid binding by globular particles. We create a synthetic cellular system consisting of a lipid-anchored receptor in the form of GPI-anchored anti-GFP nanobodies and a multivalent globular binder exposing 180 regularly-spaced GFP molecules on its surface. We show that these globular, 40 nm diameter, particles bind to cells expressing the receptor, deform the plasma membrane upon adhesion and become endocytosed in a clathrin-independent manner. We explore the role of the membrane adhesion energy in endocytosis by using receptors with affinities varying over 7 orders of magnitude. Using this system, we find that once a threshold in adhesion energy is overcome to allow for membrane deformation, endocytosis occurs reliably. Multivalent, binding-induced membrane deformation by globular binders is thus sufficient for internalization to occur and we suggest it is the common, purely biophysical mechanism for lipid-binding mediated endocytosis of toxins and pathogens.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the advent of AlphaFold, protein structure prediction has attained remarkable accuracy. These achievements resulted from a focus on single static structures. The next frontier in this field involves enhancing our ability to model conformational ensembles, not just the ground states of proteins. Notably, deposited structures result from interpretation of density maps, which are derived from either X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These maps represent ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in multiple conformations. Here, we present the latest developments in qFit, an automated computational approach to model protein conformational heterogeneity into density maps. We present algorithmic advancements to qFit, validated by improved Rfree and geometry metrics across a broad and diverse set of proteins. Automated multiconformer modeling holds significant promise for interpreting experimental structural biology data and for generating novel hypotheses linking macromolecular conformational dynamics to function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In most bacteria, chromosome segregation is driven by the ParABS system where the CTPase protein ParB loads at the parS site to trigger the formation of a large partition complex. Here, we present in vitro studies of the partition complex for Bacillus subtilis ParB, using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and AFM imaging to show that transient ParB-ParB bridges are essential for forming DNA condensates. Molecular Dynamics simulations confirm that condensation occurs abruptly at a critical concentration of ParB and show that multimerization is a prerequisite for forming the partition complex. Magnetic tweezer force spectroscopy on mutant ParB proteins demonstrates that CTP hydrolysis at the N-terminal domain is essential for DNA condensation. Finally, we show that transcribing RNA polymerases can steadily traverse the ParB-DNA partition complex. These findings uncover how ParB forms a stable yet dynamic partition complex for chromosome segregation that induces DNA condensation and segregation while enabling replication and transcription.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane-associated protein phase separation plays critical roles in cell biology, driving essential cellular phenomena from immune signaling to membrane traffic. Importantly, by restricting diffusion to a two-dimensional surface, lipid bilayers can nucleate phase separation at far lower concentrations compared to those required for phase separation in solution. How might other intracellular lipid substrates, such as lipid droplets, contribute to nucleation of phase separation? Distinct from bilayer membranes, lipid droplets consist of a phospholipid monolayer surrounding a core of neutral lipids, and they are energy storage organelles that protect cells from lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered proteins can undergo phase separation on the surface of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets. Specifically, we find that model disordered domains, FUS LC and LAF1-RGG, separate into protein-rich and protein-depleted phases on the surfaces of lipid droplets. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of interactions between FUS LC proteins, increasing ionic strength drives an increase in its phase separation on droplet surfaces. The opposite is true for LAF1-RGG, owing to the electrostatic nature of its interprotein interactions. In both cases, protein-rich phases on the surfaces of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets demonstrate molecular mobility indicative of a liquid-like state. Our results show that lipid droplets can nucleate protein condensates, suggesting that protein phase separation could be key in organizing biological processes involving lipid droplets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Formation of biomolecular condensates via phase separation enables compartmentation of many cellular processes. However, how cells can control condensation at specific locations to create complex cellular structures remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanism of tight junction formation, which involves condensation of scaffold proteins at cell-cell contacts and elongation of the condensates into a belt around the cellular perimeter. Using cell biology, reconstitution, and thermodynamic theory, we discovered that cells use surface phase transitions to control local condensation at the membrane far below bulk saturation. Surface condensation of junctional ZO-scaffold proteins is mediated by receptor binding and regulated by the receptors oligomerization state. Functionally, ZO surface condensation is directly coupled to actin polymerization and bundling, which drives elongation of receptor-ZO-actin condensates similar to tight junction belt formation in cells. We conclude that surface phase transitions provide a robust mechanism to control the position and shape of protein condensates.

        <p class="abstract">The endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway regulates protein quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum. ERAD of lumenal and membrane proteins requires a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase, called Hrd1. We do not understand the molecular configurations of Hrd1 that enable autoubiquitination and the subsequent retrotranslocation of misfolded protein substrates from the ER to the cytosol. Here, we have established a generalizable, single-molecule platform that enables high-efficiency labeling, stoichiometry determination, and functional assays for any integral membrane protein. Using this approach, we directly count Hrd1 proteins reconstituted into individual proteoliposomes. We found that Hrd1 assembles in different oligomeric configurations with mostly monomers and dimers detected at limiting dilution. By correlating oligomeric states with ubiquitination in vitro, we determined that Hrd1 monomers were incapable of autoubiquitination while dimers efficiently assembled polyubiquitin chains. Therefore, our results reveal the minimal composition of a Hrd1 oligomer that is capable of autoubiquitination. Our methods are broadly applicable to studying other complex membrane protein functions using reconstituted bilayer systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments generally require sub-nanomolar protein concentrations to isolate single protein molecules, which makes such experiments challenging in live cells due to high intracellular protein concentrations. Here, we show that single-molecule observations can be achieved in live cells through a drastic reduction in the observation volume using overmilled zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs - subwavelength-size holes in a metal film). Overmilling of the ZMW in a palladium film creates a nanowell of tunable size in the glass layer below the aperture, which cells can penetrate. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental characterization of the optical properties of these nanowells over a wide range of ZMW diameters and overmilling depths, showing an excellent signal confinement and a five-fold fluorescence enhancement of fluorescent molecules inside nanowells. ZMW nanowells facilitate live-cell imaging, as cells form stable protrusions into the nanowells. Importantly, the nanowells greatly reduce cytoplasmic background fluorescence, enabling detection of individual membrane-bound fluorophores in the presence of high cytoplasmic expression levels, which could not be achieved with TIRF microscopy. Zero-mode waveguide nanowells thus provide great potential to study individual proteins in living cells.

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger that mediates diverse intracellular signals. Studies of cAMP transport in cells have produced wildly different results, from reports of nearly free diffusion to reports that cAMP remains localized in nanometer-scale domains. We developed an all-optical toolkit, termed cAMP-SITES, to locally perturb and map cAMP transport. In MDCK cells and in cultured neurons, cAMP had a diffusion coefficient of ~120 m2/s, similar to the diffusion coefficients of other small molecules in cytoplasm. In neuronal dendrites, a balance between diffusion and degradation led to cAMP domains with a length scale of ~30 m. Geometrical confinement by membranes led to subcellular variations in cAMP concentration, but we found no evidence of nanoscale domains or of distinct membrane-local and cytoplasmic pools. We introduce theoretical relations between cell geometry and small-molecule reaction-diffusion dynamics and transport to explain our observations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Entropic forces have been argued to allow bacteria to segregate their chromosomes during replication. In many bacterial species, however, specifically evolved mechanisms, such as loop-extruding SMC complexes and the ParABS origin segregation system, are required for chromosome segregation, suggesting that entropic forces alone may be insufficient. The interplay between and the relative contributions of these segregation mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop a biophysical model showing that purely entropic forces actually inhibit bacterial chromosome segregation until late replication stages. By contrast, we find that loop-extruders loaded at the origins of replication, as found in many bacterial species, alter the effective topology of the chromosome, thereby redirecting and enhancing entropic forces to enable accurate chromosome segregation concurrent with replication. In addition, our model indicates that locally acting origin separation mechanisms, such as the ParABS system, cannot redirect segregation-inhibiting entropic forces. We confirm our predictions with 3D simulations of a replicating polymer: purely entropic forces do not allow for concurrent replication and segregation; entropic forces steered by loop-extruders loaded at the origin lead to robust, global chromosome segregation; and origin separation alone is effective at early replication stages, but does not fully segregate terminal regions. Together, our results illustrate how entropic forces and loop-extrusion play synergistic roles during bacterial chromosome segregation, whereas locally acting mechanisms serve a complementary function.</p>
