A.; Knapp, S.; Mathea, S.\nScore: 36.1, Published: 2023-09-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.07.556689\nMutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial Parkinsons Disease (PD), and a risk factor for the sporadic form. Increased kinase activity has been shown in both familial and sporadic PD patients, making LRRK2 kinase inhibitors a major focus of drug development efforts in PD. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the structural biology of LRRK2, there are no available structures of LRRK2 inhibitor complexes. To this end, we solved cryo-EM structures of LRRK2, wild-type and PD-linked mutants, bound to the LRRK2-specific type-I inhibitor MLi-2 and the broad-spectrum type-II inhibitor GZD-824. Our structures revealed LRRK2s kinase in the active-like state, stabilized by type-I inhibitor interactions, and an inactive DYG-out type-II inhibitor complex. Our structural analysis also showed how inhibitor-induced conformational changes in LRRK2 are affected by its autoinhibitory N-terminal repeats. The structural models provide a template for the rational development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors covering both canonical inhibitor binding modes.\nMINSTED tracking of single biomolecules\nAuthors: Scheiderer, L.; von der Emde, H.; Hesselink, M.; Weber, M.; Hell, S. W.\nScore: 16.7, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557902\nWe show that MINSTED localization, a method whereby the position of a fluorophore is identified with precisely controlled beams of a STED microscope, tracks fluorophores and hence labeled biomolecules with nanometer/millisecond spatio-temporal precision. By updating the position for each detected photon, MINSTED recognizes fluorophore steps of 16 nm within \u003c 250 microseconds using about 13 photons. The power of MINSTED tracking is demonstrated by quantifying side-steps of the motor protein kinesin-1 walking on microtubules and switching protofilaments.\nConserved nucleocytoplasmic density homeostasis drives cellular organization across eukaryotes\nAuthors: Biswas, A.; Munoz, O.; Kim, K.; Hoege, C.; Lorton, B. M.; Shechter, D.; Guck, J.; Zaburdaev, V.; Reber, S.\nScore: 76.9, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556409\nThe packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.\nMatrix Softening Controls Stretch-Induced Cellular Memory and Fibroblast Activation\nAuthors: Hong, Y.; Peng, X.; Yu, H.; Jafari, M.; Shakiba, D.; Huang, Y.; Qu, C.; Melika, E.; Tawadros, A.; Mujahid, A.; Sandler, J.; Pryse, K.; Sacks, J.; Elson, E.; Genin, G.; Alisafaei, F.\nScore: 11.1, Published: 2023-09-04 DOI: 10.1101/2022.10.12.511903\nMechanical stretching of living tissues can activate long-lived changes in tissue cells such as fibroblasts, increasing their contractility and initiating phenotypic transformations. Increased mechanical stimulus typically leads to monotonically increasing activation of fibroblasts cultured in 2D, but activation levels are difficult to predict for cells in 3D fibrous tissues, leading to variable outcomes in procedures such as skin grafting. Here we report that the source of this variation is cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and their variation with the duration and magnitude of applied stretch, and present a model that can predict the degree to which stretch will either increase or decrease long-term activation levels of fibroblasts cultured within a stretched, three-dimensional collagen matrix. Combining experimental and mathematical approaches across multiple scales, we show that the viscoplasticity of the ECM regulates this nonmonotonic, long-term cell activation. Results demonstrate that feedback between cell and ECM determines how cells retain memory of mechanical stretch.\nIn situ cryoET reveals inhibitor-induced perturbations in Pf80S GTPase interactions\nAuthors: Anton, L.; Cheng, W.; Haile, M.; Cobb, D. W.; Zhu, X.; Han, L.; Li, E.; Nair, A.; Lee, C. L.; Ke, H.; Zhang, G.; Doud, E. H.; Ho, C.-M.\nScore: 104.6, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556115\nMalaria parasites rely heavily on rapid, high fidelity protein synthesis to infect and replicate in human erythrocytes, making translation an attractive target for new antimalarials. Here, we have determined in situ structures of Pf80S ribosomes in thirteen conformational and compositional states from cryoFIB-milled Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes across the stages of asexual intraerythrocytic parasite replication. We observe eight active translation intermediates, enabling us to define the native malarial translation elongation cycle, which surprisingly features a bifurcation at the decoding stage of the cycle that has not previously been described. Examination of perturbations in the distribution of ribosomes among these states in the presence of a malaria-specific translation inhibitor suggest that the inhibitor impedes PfeEF2 and PfeEF1 interactions with the ribosome. We integrated our in situ cryoET data with proteomic and ultrastructural data to arrive at a deeper understanding of malarial translation, which will inform development of new therapies.\nBenchmarking Cross-Docking Strategies for Structure-Informed Machine Learning in Kinase Drug Discovery\nAuthors: Schaller, D.; Christ, C. D.; Chodera, J. D.; Volkamer, A.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.557138\nIn recent years machine learning has transformed many aspects of the drug discovery process including small molecule design for which the prediction of the bioactivity is an integral part. Leveraging structural information about the interactions between a small molecule and its protein target has great potential for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, but is fundamentally limited by the accuracy with which protein:ligand complex structures can be predicted in a reliable and automated fashion. With the goal of finding practical approaches to generating useful kinase:inhibitor complex geometries for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, we present a kinase-centric docking benchmark assessing the performance of different classes of docking and pose selection strategies to assess how well experimentally observed binding modes are recapitulated in a realistic cross-docking scenario. The assembled benchmark data set focuses on the well-studied protein kinase family and comprises a subset of 589 protein structures co-crystallized with 423 ATP-competitive ligands. We find that the docking methods biased by the co-crystallized ligand - utilizing shape overlap with or without maximum common substructure matching - are more successful in recovering binding poses than standard physics-based docking alone. Also, docking into multiple structures significantly increases the chance to generate a low RMSD docking pose. Docking utilizing an approach that combines all three methods (Posit) into structures with the most similar co-crystallized ligands according to shape and electrostatics proofed to be the most efficient way to reproduce binding poses achieving a success rate of 66.9% across all included systems. The studied docking and pose selection strategies - which utilize the OpenEye Toolkit - were implemented into pipelines of the KinoML framework (https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml) allowing automated and reliable protein:ligand complex generation for future downstream machine learning tasks. Although focused on protein kinases, we believe the general findings can also be transferred to other protein families.\nRepresentation of Protein Dynamics Disentangled by Time-structure-based Prior\nAuthors: Ishizone, T.; Matsunaga, Y.; Fuchigami, S.; Nakamura, K.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.13.557264\nRepresentation learning (RL) is a universal technique for deriving low-dimensional disentangled representations from high-dimensional observations, aiding a multitude of downstream tasks. RL has been extensively applied to various data types, including images and natural language. Here, we analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of biomolecules in terms of RL to obtain disentangled representations related to their conformational transitions. Currently, state-of-the-art RL techniques, which are mainly motivated by the variational principle, try to capture slow motions in the representation (latent) space. Here, we propose two methods based on alternative perspective on the disentanglement in the representation space. The methods introduce a simple prior that imposes temporal constraints in the representation space, serving as a regularization term to facilitate capturing disentangled representations of dynamics. The introduction of this simple prior aids in characterizing the conformational transitions of proteins. Indeed, comparison with other methods via the analysis of MD simulation trajectories for alanine dipeptide and chignolin validates that the proposed methods construct Markov state models (MSMs) whose implied time scales are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. By coarse-graining MSMs, we further show the methods aid to detect physically important interactions for conformational transitions. Overall, our methods provide good representations of complex biomolecular dynamics for downstream tasks, allowing for better interpretations of conformational transitions.\nStructural and mechanistic insights into human choline transport\nAuthors: Weng, T.-H.; Claveras Cabezudo, A.; Jösting, W.; Bazzone, A.; Welsch, S.; Gursu, G.; Hummer, G.; Wu, D.; Safarian, S.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557925\nHuman feline leukaemia virus subgroup C receptor-related proteins 1 and 2 (FLVCR1 and 2) are major facilitator superfamily transporters from the solute carrier family 49. Dysregulation of these ubiquitous transporters has been linked to various haematological and neurological disorders. While both FLVCRs were initially proposed to hold a physiological function in heme transport, subsequent studies questioned this notion. Here, we used structural, computational and biochemical methods and conclude that these two FLVCRs function as human choline transporters. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of FLVCRs in different inward- and outward-facing conformations, captured in the apo state or in complex with choline in their translocation pathways. Our findings provide insights into the molecular framework of choline coordination and transport, largely mediated by conserved cation-{pi} interactions, and further illuminate the conformational dynamics of the transport cycle. Moreover, we identified a heme binding site on the protein surface of the FLVCR2 N-domain, and observed that heme actively drives the conformational transitions of the protein. This auxiliary binding site might indicate a potential regulatory role of heme in the FLVCR2 transport mechanisms. Our work resolves the contested substrate specificity of the FLVCRs, and sheds light on the process of maintaining cellular choline homeostasis at the molecular level.\nNanopores reveal the stoichiometry of single oligo-adenylates produced by type III CRISPR-Cas\nAuthors: Fuentenebro-Navas, D.; Steens, J. A.; De Lannoy, C.; Noordijk, B.; de Ridder, D.; Staals, R. H. J.; Schmid, S.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2023-08-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553839\nCyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) are small second messenger molecules produced by the type III CRISPR-Cas system as part of the prokaryotic immune response. The role of cOAs is to allosterically activate downstream effector proteins that induce dormancy or cell death, and thus abort viral spread through the population. Interestingly, different type III systems have been reported to utilize different cOA stoichiometries (with 3 to 6 adenylate monophosphates). However, so far, their characterization has only been possible in bulk and with sophisticated equipment, while a portable assay with single-molecule resolution has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate the label-free detection of single cOA molecules using a simple protein nanopore assay. It sensitively identifies the stoichiometry of individual cOA molecules and their mixtures from synthetic and enzymatic origin. To achieve this, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) and validated it with a series of experiments on mono- and polydisperse cOA samples. Ultimately, we determined the stoichiometric composition of cOAs produced enzymatically by the CRISPR type III-A and III-B variants of Thermus thermophilus. Interestingly, both variants produce cOAs of nearly identical composition, and we discuss the biological implications of this finding. The presented nanopore-CNN workflow with single-cOA resolution can be adapted to many other signaling molecules (including eukaryotic ones), and it may be integrated into portable handheld devices with potential point-of-care applications.\nSingle-molecule FRET and tracking of transfected biomolecules: multi-dimensional protein dynamics in living cells\nAuthors: Anandamurugan, A.; Eidloth, A.; Wortmann, P.; Schrangl, L.; Aprile-Garcia, F.; Lan, C.; Sawarkar, R.; Schuetz, G.; Hugel, T.\nScore: 5.0, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.15.557875\nProteins in cells exhibit conformational dynamics, equally influenced by dynamic interactions with other biomolecules and their spatial variations, which can be induced by the protein's compartment. Altogether this multi-dimensional dynamic is difficult to measure in cellula, because of limitations in instrumentation, fluorescence methodologies and the difficulty to track freely diffusing molecules. Here, we present a bottom-up engineering approach, which allows us to track transfected proteins in cellula and analyze time-resolved single-molecule FRET efficiencies. This has been achieved by alternating laser excitation (ALEX) based three-channel (donor, acceptor and FRET intensity) tracking with a live-cell HILO microscope. Unexpectedly, we find that the heat shock protein Hsp90 shows different conformational populations in vitro and in cellula. Moreover, Hsp90's conformational states depend on the localization within the cell, which is demonstrated by comparing a physical (microinjection) and a biological (SLO) transfection method. FRET-TTB (Tracking of Transfected Biomolecules) opens the path to study protein conformational dynamics of transfected and native biomolecules in cellula, including time-resolved cellular localization.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Mutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are a common cause of familial Parkinsons Disease (PD), and a risk factor for the sporadic form. Increased kinase activity has been shown in both familial and sporadic PD patients, making LRRK2 kinase inhibitors a major focus of drug development efforts in PD. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the structural biology of LRRK2, there are no available structures of LRRK2 inhibitor complexes. To this end, we solved cryo-EM structures of LRRK2, wild-type and PD-linked mutants, bound to the LRRK2-specific type-I inhibitor MLi-2 and the broad-spectrum type-II inhibitor GZD-824. Our structures revealed LRRK2s kinase in the active-like state, stabilized by type-I inhibitor interactions, and an inactive DYG-out type-II inhibitor complex. Our structural analysis also showed how inhibitor-induced conformational changes in LRRK2 are affected by its autoinhibitory N-terminal repeats. The structural models provide a template for the rational development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors covering both canonical inhibitor binding modes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We show that MINSTED localization, a method whereby the position of a fluorophore is identified with precisely controlled beams of a STED microscope, tracks fluorophores and hence labeled biomolecules with nanometer/millisecond spatio-temporal precision. By updating the position for each detected photon, MINSTED recognizes fluorophore steps of 16 nm within &lt; 250 microseconds using about 13 photons. The power of MINSTED tracking is demonstrated by quantifying side-steps of the motor protein kinesin-1 walking on microtubules and switching protofilaments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mechanical stretching of living tissues can activate long-lived changes in tissue cells such as fibroblasts, increasing their contractility and initiating phenotypic transformations. Increased mechanical stimulus typically leads to monotonically increasing activation of fibroblasts cultured in 2D, but activation levels are difficult to predict for cells in 3D fibrous tissues, leading to variable outcomes in procedures such as skin grafting. Here we report that the source of this variation is cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and their variation with the duration and magnitude of applied stretch, and present a model that can predict the degree to which stretch will either increase or decrease long-term activation levels of fibroblasts cultured within a stretched, three-dimensional collagen matrix. Combining experimental and mathematical approaches across multiple scales, we show that the viscoplasticity of the ECM regulates this nonmonotonic, long-term cell activation. Results demonstrate that feedback between cell and ECM determines how cells retain memory of mechanical stretch.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Malaria parasites rely heavily on rapid, high fidelity protein synthesis to infect and replicate in human erythrocytes, making translation an attractive target for new antimalarials. Here, we have determined in situ structures of Pf80S ribosomes in thirteen conformational and compositional states from cryoFIB-milled Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes across the stages of asexual intraerythrocytic parasite replication. We observe eight active translation intermediates, enabling us to define the native malarial translation elongation cycle, which surprisingly features a bifurcation at the decoding stage of the cycle that has not previously been described. Examination of perturbations in the distribution of ribosomes among these states in the presence of a malaria-specific translation inhibitor suggest that the inhibitor impedes PfeEF2 and PfeEF1 interactions with the ribosome. We integrated our in situ cryoET data with proteomic and ultrastructural data to arrive at a deeper understanding of malarial translation, which will inform development of new therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In recent years machine learning has transformed many aspects of the drug discovery process including small molecule design for which the prediction of the bioactivity is an integral part. Leveraging structural information about the interactions between a small molecule and its protein target has great potential for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, but is fundamentally limited by the accuracy with which protein:ligand complex structures can be predicted in a reliable and automated fashion. With the goal of finding practical approaches to generating useful kinase:inhibitor complex geometries for downstream machine learning scoring approaches, we present a kinase-centric docking benchmark assessing the performance of different classes of docking and pose selection strategies to assess how well experimentally observed binding modes are recapitulated in a realistic cross-docking scenario. The assembled benchmark data set focuses on the well-studied protein kinase family and comprises a subset of 589 protein structures co-crystallized with 423 ATP-competitive ligands. We find that the docking methods biased by the co-crystallized ligand - utilizing shape overlap with or without maximum common substructure matching - are more successful in recovering binding poses than standard physics-based docking alone. Also, docking into multiple structures significantly increases the chance to generate a low RMSD docking pose. Docking utilizing an approach that combines all three methods (Posit) into structures with the most similar co-crystallized ligands according to shape and electrostatics proofed to be the most efficient way to reproduce binding poses achieving a success rate of 66.9% across all included systems. The studied docking and pose selection strategies - which utilize the OpenEye Toolkit - were implemented into pipelines of the KinoML framework (https://github.com/openkinome/kinoml) allowing automated and reliable protein:ligand complex generation for future downstream machine learning tasks. Although focused on protein kinases, we believe the general findings can also be transferred to other protein families.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Representation learning (RL) is a universal technique for deriving low-dimensional disentangled representations from high-dimensional observations, aiding a multitude of downstream tasks. RL has been extensively applied to various data types, including images and natural language. Here, we analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of biomolecules in terms of RL to obtain disentangled representations related to their conformational transitions. Currently, state-of-the-art RL techniques, which are mainly motivated by the variational principle, try to capture slow motions in the representation (latent) space. Here, we propose two methods based on alternative perspective on the disentanglement in the representation space. The methods introduce a simple prior that imposes temporal constraints in the representation space, serving as a regularization term to facilitate capturing disentangled representations of dynamics. The introduction of this simple prior aids in characterizing the conformational transitions of proteins. Indeed, comparison with other methods via the analysis of MD simulation trajectories for alanine dipeptide and chignolin validates that the proposed methods construct Markov state models (MSMs) whose implied time scales are comparable to state-of-the-art methods. By coarse-graining MSMs, we further show the methods aid to detect physically important interactions for conformational transitions. Overall, our methods provide good representations of complex biomolecular dynamics for downstream tasks, allowing for better interpretations of conformational transitions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Human feline leukaemia virus subgroup C receptor-related proteins 1 and 2 (FLVCR1 and 2) are major facilitator superfamily transporters from the solute carrier family 49. Dysregulation of these ubiquitous transporters has been linked to various haematological and neurological disorders. While both FLVCRs were initially proposed to hold a physiological function in heme transport, subsequent studies questioned this notion. Here, we used structural, computational and biochemical methods and conclude that these two FLVCRs function as human choline transporters. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of FLVCRs in different inward- and outward-facing conformations, captured in the apo state or in complex with choline in their translocation pathways. Our findings provide insights into the molecular framework of choline coordination and transport, largely mediated by conserved cation-{pi} interactions, and further illuminate the conformational dynamics of the transport cycle. Moreover, we identified a heme binding site on the protein surface of the FLVCR2 N-domain, and observed that heme actively drives the conformational transitions of the protein. This auxiliary binding site might indicate a potential regulatory role of heme in the FLVCR2 transport mechanisms. Our work resolves the contested substrate specificity of the FLVCRs, and sheds light on the process of maintaining cellular choline homeostasis at the molecular level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) are small second messenger molecules produced by the type III CRISPR-Cas system as part of the prokaryotic immune response. The role of cOAs is to allosterically activate downstream effector proteins that induce dormancy or cell death, and thus abort viral spread through the population. Interestingly, different type III systems have been reported to utilize different cOA stoichiometries (with 3 to 6 adenylate monophosphates). However, so far, their characterization has only been possible in bulk and with sophisticated equipment, while a portable assay with single-molecule resolution has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate the label-free detection of single cOA molecules using a simple protein nanopore assay. It sensitively identifies the stoichiometry of individual cOA molecules and their mixtures from synthetic and enzymatic origin. To achieve this, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) and validated it with a series of experiments on mono- and polydisperse cOA samples. Ultimately, we determined the stoichiometric composition of cOAs produced enzymatically by the CRISPR type III-A and III-B variants of Thermus thermophilus. Interestingly, both variants produce cOAs of nearly identical composition, and we discuss the biological implications of this finding. The presented nanopore-CNN workflow with single-cOA resolution can be adapted to many other signaling molecules (including eukaryotic ones), and it may be integrated into portable handheld devices with potential point-of-care applications.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Proteins in cells exhibit conformational dynamics, equally influenced by dynamic interactions with other biomolecules and their spatial variations, which can be induced by the protein&#39;s compartment. Altogether this multi-dimensional dynamic is difficult to measure in cellula, because of limitations in instrumentation, fluorescence methodologies and the difficulty to track freely diffusing molecules. Here, we present a bottom-up engineering approach, which allows us to track transfected proteins in cellula and analyze time-resolved single-molecule FRET efficiencies. This has been achieved by alternating laser excitation (ALEX) based three-channel (donor, acceptor and FRET intensity) tracking with a live-cell HILO microscope. Unexpectedly, we find that the heat shock protein Hsp90 shows different conformational populations in vitro and in cellula. Moreover, Hsp90&#39;s conformational states depend on the localization within the cell, which is demonstrated by comparing a physical (microinjection) and a biological (SLO) transfection method. FRET-TTB (Tracking of Transfected Biomolecules) opens the path to study protein conformational dynamics of transfected and native biomolecules in cellula, including time-resolved cellular localization.</p>
