J.; Goerlach, E.; O'Neill, G. M.; Budday, S.; Strissel, P.; Strick, R.; Malandrino, A.; Gerum, R.; Mak, M.; Rausch, M.; Fabry, B.\nScore: 33.6, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546896\nCells cultured in 3D fibrous biopolymer matrices exert traction forces on their environment that induce deformations and remodeling of the fiber network. By measuring these deformations, the traction forces can be reconstructed if the mechanical properties of the matrix and the force-free matrix configuration are known. These requirements severely limit the applicability of traction force reconstruction in practice. In this study, we test whether force-induced matrix remodeling can instead be used as a proxy for cellular traction forces. We measure the traction forces of hepatic stellate cells and different glioblastoma cell lines and quantify matrix remodeling by measuring the fiber orientation and fiber density around these cells. In agreement with simulated fiber networks, we demonstrate that changes in local fiber orientation and density are directly related to cell forces. By resolving Rho-kinase (ROCK) Inhibitor-induced changes of traction forces and fiber alignment and density in hepatic stellate cells, we show that the method is suitable for drug screening assays. We conclude that differences in local fiber orientation and density, which are easily measurable, can be used as a qualitative proxy for changes in traction forces. The method is available as an open-source Python package with a graphical user interface.\nImaging proteins sensitive to direct fusions using transient peptide-peptide interactions\nAuthors: Gidden, Z.; Oi, C.; Johnston, E.; Bhaskar, H.; Rosser, S.; Mochrie, S. G. J.; Horrocks, M. H.; Regan, L.\nScore: 29.3, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.01.547312\nFluorescence microscopy enables specific visualization of proteins in living cells and has played an important role in our understanding of protein subcellular location and function. Some proteins, however, show altered localization and/or function when labeled using direct fusions to fluorescent proteins, making them difficult to study in live cells. Additionally, the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited to ~200 nm, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the size of most proteins. To circumvent these challenges, we previously developed LIVE-PAINT, a live-cell super-resolution approach that takes advantage of short interacting peptides to transiently bind a fluorescent protein to the protein-of-interest. Here, we successfully use LIVE-PAINT to image yeast membrane proteins that do not tolerate the direct fusion of a fluorescent protein by using peptide tags as short as 5-residues. We also demonstrate that it is possible to resolve multiple proteins at the nanoscale concurrently using orthogonal peptide interaction pairs.\nUncovering Protein Ensembles: Automated Multiconformer Model Building for X-ray Crystallography and Cryo-EM\nAuthors: Wankowicz, S. A.; Ravikumar, A.; Sharma, S.; Riley, B.; Raju, A.; Hogan, D. W.; van den Bedem, H.; Keedy, D. A.; Fraser, J. S.\nScore: 25.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546963\nWith the advent of AlphaFold, protein structure prediction has attained remarkable accuracy. These achievements resulted from a focus on single static structures. The next frontier in this field involves enhancing our ability to model conformational ensembles, not just the ground states of proteins. Notably, deposited structures result from interpretation of density maps, which are derived from either X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These maps represent ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in multiple conformations. Here, we present the latest developments in qFit, an automated computational approach to model protein conformational heterogeneity into density maps. We present algorithmic advancements to qFit, validated by improved Rfree and geometry metrics across a broad and diverse set of proteins. Automated multiconformer modeling holds significant promise for interpreting experimental structural biology data and for generating novel hypotheses linking macromolecular conformational dynamics to function.\nRapid assessment of changes in phage bioactivity using dynamic light scattering\nAuthors: Dharmaraj, T.; Kratochvil, M.

H.; Barr, J. J.; Lavigne, R.; Heilshorn, S. C.; Blankenberg, F. G.; Bollyky, P. L.\nScore: 21.0, Published: 2023-07-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.02.547396\nExtensive efforts are underway to develop bacteriophages as therapies against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, these efforts are confounded by the instability of phage preparations and a lack of suitable tools to assess active phage concentrations over time. Here, we use Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to measure changes in phage physical state in response to environmental factors and time, finding that phages tend to decay and form aggregates and that the degree of aggregation can be used to predict phage bioactivity. We then use DLS to optimize phage storage conditions for phages from human clinical trials, predict bioactivity in 50-year-old archival stocks, and evaluate phage samples for use in a phage therapy/wound infection model. We also provide a web-application (Phage-ELF) to facilitate DLS studies of phages. We conclude that DLS provides a rapid, convenient, and non-destructive tool for quality control of phage preparations in academic and commercial settings.\nBaited reconstruction with 2D template matching for high-resolution structure determination in vitro and in vivo without template bias\nAuthors: Lucas, B. A.; Himes, B. A.; Grigorieff, N.\nScore: 17.9, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547552\nCryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology, rapidly increasing the number of available molecular structures. Because of this, as well as advances in structure prediction, the focus of structural biology has begun to shift to studying macromolecular structures in their native cellular environment. A dominant feature of cryo-EM images is shot noise, making the identification of small particles of interest difficult. This is further compounded by structural noise if these particles are imaged against a background of other molecules, such as inside a cell. 2D template matching (2DTM) can be used to localize complexes with high precision, even in the presence of cellular background. Once localized, these particles may be averaged together in 3D reconstructions; however, regions included in the template may suffer from template bias, leading to inflated resolution estimates and making the interpretation of high-resolution features unreliable. We evaluate conditions that minimize template bias and show that molecular features not present in the template can be reconstructed at high resolution from targets found by 2DTM, extending prior work at low-resolution. Moreover, we present a quantitative metric for template bias to aid the interpretation of 3D reconstructions calculated using particles localized by 2DTM.\nLipid droplets as substrates for protein phase separation\nAuthors: Kamatar, A.; Bravo, J. P. K.; Yuan, F.; Wang, L.; Lafer, E. M.; Taylor, D. W.; Stachowiak, J.; Parekh, S. H.\nScore: 16.2, Published: 2023-06-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.28.546804\nMembrane-associated protein phase separation plays critical roles in cell biology, driving essential cellular phenomena from immune signaling to membrane traffic. Importantly, by restricting diffusion to a two-dimensional surface, lipid bilayers can nucleate phase separation at far lower concentrations compared to those required for phase separation in solution. How might other intracellular lipid substrates, such as lipid droplets, contribute to nucleation of phase separation? Distinct from bilayer membranes, lipid droplets consist of a phospholipid monolayer surrounding a core of neutral lipids, and they are energy storage organelles that protect cells from lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered proteins can undergo phase separation on the surface of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets. Specifically, we find that model disordered domains, FUS LC and LAF1-RGG, separate into protein-rich and protein-depleted phases on the surfaces of lipid droplets. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of interactions between FUS LC proteins, increasing ionic strength drives an increase in its phase separation on droplet surfaces. The opposite is true for LAF1-RGG, owing to the electrostatic nature of its interprotein interactions. In both cases, protein-rich phases on the surfaces of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets demonstrate molecular mobility indicative of a liquid-like state. Our results show that lipid droplets can nucleate protein condensates, suggesting that protein phase separation could be key in organizing biological processes involving lipid droplets.\nTopology-dependent DNA binding\nAuthors: Kolbeck, P. J.; Tisma, M.; Analikwu, B. T.; Vanderlinden, W.; Dekker, C.; Lipfert, J.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547266\nDNA stores our genetic information and is ubiquitous in biological and biotechnological applications, where it interacts with binding partners ranging from small molecules to large macromolecular complexes. Binding is modulated by mechanical strains in the molecule and, in turn, can change the local DNA structure. Frequently, DNA occurs in closed topological forms where topology and supercoiling add a global constraint to the interplay of binding-induced deformations and strain-modulated binding. Here, we present a quantitative model of how the global constraints introduced by DNA topology modulate binding and create a complex interplay between topology and affinity. We focus on fluorescent intercalators, which unwind DNA and enable direct quantification via fluorescence detection. Using bulk measurements, we show that DNA supercoiling can increase or decrease intercalation relative to an open topology depending on ligand concentration and the initial topology. Our model quantitatively accounts for observations obtained using psoralen for UV-induced DNA crosslinking, which is frequently used to quantify supercoiling in vivo. Finally, we observe topology-dependent binding in a single-molecule assay, which provides direct access to binding kinetics and DNA supercoil dynamics. Our results have broad implications for the detection and quantification of DNA and for the modulation of DNA binding in cellular contexts.\nLoop-extruders alter bacterial chromosome topology to direct entropic forces for segregation\nAuthors: Harju, J.; van Teeseling, M. C. F.; Broedersz, C. P.\nScore: 13.7, Published: 2023-07-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.30.547230\nEntropic forces have been argued to allow bacteria to segregate their chromosomes during replication. In many bacterial species, however, specifically evolved mechanisms, such as loop-extruding SMC complexes and the ParABS origin segregation system, are required for chromosome segregation, suggesting that entropic forces alone may be insufficient. The interplay between and the relative contributions of these segregation mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop a biophysical model showing that purely entropic forces actually inhibit bacterial chromosome segregation until late replication stages. By contrast, we find that loop-extruders loaded at the origins of replication, as found in many bacterial species, alter the effective topology of the chromosome, thereby redirecting and enhancing entropic forces to enable accurate chromosome segregation concurrent with replication. In addition, our model indicates that locally acting origin separation mechanisms, such as the ParABS system, cannot redirect segregation-inhibiting entropic forces. We confirm our predictions with 3D simulations of a replicating polymer: purely entropic forces do not allow for concurrent replication and segregation; entropic forces steered by loop-extruders loaded at the origin lead to robust, global chromosome segregation; and origin separation alone is effective at early replication stages, but does not fully segregate terminal regions. Together, our results illustrate how entropic forces and loop-extrusion play synergistic roles during bacterial chromosome segregation, whereas locally acting mechanisms serve a complementary function.\nDiffusiophoresis promotes phase separation and transport of biomolecular condensates\nAuthors: Doan, V. S.; Alshareedah, I.; Singh, A.; Banerjee, P. R.; Shin, S.\nScore: 10.9, Published: 2023-07-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.03.547532\nThe internal microenvironment of a living cell is heterogeneous and comprises a multitude of organelles with distinct biochemistry. Amongst them are biomolecular condensates, which are membrane-less, phase-separated compartments enriched in system-specific proteins and nucleic acids. The heterogeneity of the cell engenders the presence of multiple spatiotemporal gradients in chemistry, charge, concentration, temperature, and pressure. Such thermodynamic gradients can lead to non-equilibrium driving forces for the formation and transport of biomolecular condensates. Here, we report how ion gradients impact the transport processes of biomolecular condensates on the mesoscale and biomolecules on the microscale. Utilizing a microfluidic platform, we demonstrate that the presence of ion concentration gradients can accelerate the transport of biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, via diffusiophoresis. This hydrodynamic transport process allows localized enrichment of biomolecules, thereby promoting the location-specific formation of biomolecular condensates via phase separation. The ion gradients further impart active motility of condensates, allowing them to exhibit enhanced diffusion along the gradient. Coupled with reentrant phase behavior, the gradient-induced active motility leads to a dynamical redistribution of condensates that ultimately extends their lifetime. Together, our results demonstrate diffusiophoresis as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic force that governs the formation and active transport of biomolecular condensates.\nZero-mode waveguide nanowells for single-molecule detection in living cells\nAuthors: Yang, S.; Klughammer, N.; Barth, A.; Tanenbaum, M. E.; Dekker, C.\nScore: 10.6, Published: 2023-06-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.26.546504\nSingle-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments generally require sub-nanomolar protein concentrations to isolate single protein molecules, which makes such experiments challenging in live cells due to high intracellular protein concentrations. Here, we show that single-molecule observations can be achieved in live cells through a drastic reduction in the observation volume using overmilled zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs - subwavelength-size holes in a metal film). Overmilling of the ZMW in a palladium film creates a nanowell of tunable size in the glass layer below the aperture, which cells can penetrate. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental characterization of the optical properties of these nanowells over a wide range of ZMW diameters and overmilling depths, showing an excellent signal confinement and a five-fold fluorescence enhancement of fluorescent molecules inside nanowells. ZMW nanowells facilitate live-cell imaging, as cells form stable protrusions into the nanowells. Importantly, the nanowells greatly reduce cytoplasmic background fluorescence, enabling detection of individual membrane-bound fluorophores in the presence of high cytoplasmic expression levels, which could not be achieved with TIRF microscopy. Zero-mode waveguide nanowells thus provide great potential to study individual proteins in living cells.

        <p class="abstract">Cells cultured in 3D fibrous biopolymer matrices exert traction forces on their environment that induce deformations and remodeling of the fiber network. By measuring these deformations, the traction forces can be reconstructed if the mechanical properties of the matrix and the force-free matrix configuration are known. These requirements severely limit the applicability of traction force reconstruction in practice. In this study, we test whether force-induced matrix remodeling can instead be used as a proxy for cellular traction forces. We measure the traction forces of hepatic stellate cells and different glioblastoma cell lines and quantify matrix remodeling by measuring the fiber orientation and fiber density around these cells. In agreement with simulated fiber networks, we demonstrate that changes in local fiber orientation and density are directly related to cell forces. By resolving Rho-kinase (ROCK) Inhibitor-induced changes of traction forces and fiber alignment and density in hepatic stellate cells, we show that the method is suitable for drug screening assays. We conclude that differences in local fiber orientation and density, which are easily measurable, can be used as a qualitative proxy for changes in traction forces. The method is available as an open-source Python package with a graphical user interface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Fluorescence microscopy enables specific visualization of proteins in living cells and has played an important role in our understanding of protein subcellular location and function. Some proteins, however, show altered localization and/or function when labeled using direct fusions to fluorescent proteins, making them difficult to study in live cells. Additionally, the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited to ~200 nm, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the size of most proteins. To circumvent these challenges, we previously developed LIVE-PAINT, a live-cell super-resolution approach that takes advantage of short interacting peptides to transiently bind a fluorescent protein to the protein-of-interest. Here, we successfully use LIVE-PAINT to image yeast membrane proteins that do not tolerate the direct fusion of a fluorescent protein by using peptide tags as short as 5-residues. We also demonstrate that it is possible to resolve multiple proteins at the nanoscale concurrently using orthogonal peptide interaction pairs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the advent of AlphaFold, protein structure prediction has attained remarkable accuracy. These achievements resulted from a focus on single static structures. The next frontier in this field involves enhancing our ability to model conformational ensembles, not just the ground states of proteins. Notably, deposited structures result from interpretation of density maps, which are derived from either X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These maps represent ensemble averages, reflecting molecules in multiple conformations. Here, we present the latest developments in qFit, an automated computational approach to model protein conformational heterogeneity into density maps. We present algorithmic advancements to qFit, validated by improved Rfree and geometry metrics across a broad and diverse set of proteins. Automated multiconformer modeling holds significant promise for interpreting experimental structural biology data and for generating novel hypotheses linking macromolecular conformational dynamics to function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extensive efforts are underway to develop bacteriophages as therapies against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, these efforts are confounded by the instability of phage preparations and a lack of suitable tools to assess active phage concentrations over time. Here, we use Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to measure changes in phage physical state in response to environmental factors and time, finding that phages tend to decay and form aggregates and that the degree of aggregation can be used to predict phage bioactivity. We then use DLS to optimize phage storage conditions for phages from human clinical trials, predict bioactivity in 50-year-old archival stocks, and evaluate phage samples for use in a phage therapy/wound infection model. We also provide a web-application (Phage-ELF) to facilitate DLS studies of phages. We conclude that DLS provides a rapid, convenient, and non-destructive tool for quality control of phage preparations in academic and commercial settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology, rapidly increasing the number of available molecular structures. Because of this, as well as advances in structure prediction, the focus of structural biology has begun to shift to studying macromolecular structures in their native cellular environment. A dominant feature of cryo-EM images is shot noise, making the identification of small particles of interest difficult. This is further compounded by structural noise if these particles are imaged against a background of other molecules, such as inside a cell. 2D template matching (2DTM) can be used to localize complexes with high precision, even in the presence of cellular background. Once localized, these particles may be averaged together in 3D reconstructions; however, regions included in the template may suffer from template bias, leading to inflated resolution estimates and making the interpretation of high-resolution features unreliable. We evaluate conditions that minimize template bias and show that molecular features not present in the template can be reconstructed at high resolution from targets found by 2DTM, extending prior work at low-resolution. Moreover, we present a quantitative metric for template bias to aid the interpretation of 3D reconstructions calculated using particles localized by 2DTM.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane-associated protein phase separation plays critical roles in cell biology, driving essential cellular phenomena from immune signaling to membrane traffic. Importantly, by restricting diffusion to a two-dimensional surface, lipid bilayers can nucleate phase separation at far lower concentrations compared to those required for phase separation in solution. How might other intracellular lipid substrates, such as lipid droplets, contribute to nucleation of phase separation? Distinct from bilayer membranes, lipid droplets consist of a phospholipid monolayer surrounding a core of neutral lipids, and they are energy storage organelles that protect cells from lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered proteins can undergo phase separation on the surface of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets. Specifically, we find that model disordered domains, FUS LC and LAF1-RGG, separate into protein-rich and protein-depleted phases on the surfaces of lipid droplets. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of interactions between FUS LC proteins, increasing ionic strength drives an increase in its phase separation on droplet surfaces. The opposite is true for LAF1-RGG, owing to the electrostatic nature of its interprotein interactions. In both cases, protein-rich phases on the surfaces of synthetic and cell-derived lipid droplets demonstrate molecular mobility indicative of a liquid-like state. Our results show that lipid droplets can nucleate protein condensates, suggesting that protein phase separation could be key in organizing biological processes involving lipid droplets.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA stores our genetic information and is ubiquitous in biological and biotechnological applications, where it interacts with binding partners ranging from small molecules to large macromolecular complexes. Binding is modulated by mechanical strains in the molecule and, in turn, can change the local DNA structure. Frequently, DNA occurs in closed topological forms where topology and supercoiling add a global constraint to the interplay of binding-induced deformations and strain-modulated binding. Here, we present a quantitative model of how the global constraints introduced by DNA topology modulate binding and create a complex interplay between topology and affinity. We focus on fluorescent intercalators, which unwind DNA and enable direct quantification via fluorescence detection. Using bulk measurements, we show that DNA supercoiling can increase or decrease intercalation relative to an open topology depending on ligand concentration and the initial topology. Our model quantitatively accounts for observations obtained using psoralen for UV-induced DNA crosslinking, which is frequently used to quantify supercoiling in vivo. Finally, we observe topology-dependent binding in a single-molecule assay, which provides direct access to binding kinetics and DNA supercoil dynamics. Our results have broad implications for the detection and quantification of DNA and for the modulation of DNA binding in cellular contexts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Entropic forces have been argued to allow bacteria to segregate their chromosomes during replication. In many bacterial species, however, specifically evolved mechanisms, such as loop-extruding SMC complexes and the ParABS origin segregation system, are required for chromosome segregation, suggesting that entropic forces alone may be insufficient. The interplay between and the relative contributions of these segregation mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop a biophysical model showing that purely entropic forces actually inhibit bacterial chromosome segregation until late replication stages. By contrast, we find that loop-extruders loaded at the origins of replication, as found in many bacterial species, alter the effective topology of the chromosome, thereby redirecting and enhancing entropic forces to enable accurate chromosome segregation concurrent with replication. In addition, our model indicates that locally acting origin separation mechanisms, such as the ParABS system, cannot redirect segregation-inhibiting entropic forces. We confirm our predictions with 3D simulations of a replicating polymer: purely entropic forces do not allow for concurrent replication and segregation; entropic forces steered by loop-extruders loaded at the origin lead to robust, global chromosome segregation; and origin separation alone is effective at early replication stages, but does not fully segregate terminal regions. Together, our results illustrate how entropic forces and loop-extrusion play synergistic roles during bacterial chromosome segregation, whereas locally acting mechanisms serve a complementary function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The internal microenvironment of a living cell is heterogeneous and comprises a multitude of organelles with distinct biochemistry. Amongst them are biomolecular condensates, which are membrane-less, phase-separated compartments enriched in system-specific proteins and nucleic acids. The heterogeneity of the cell engenders the presence of multiple spatiotemporal gradients in chemistry, charge, concentration, temperature, and pressure. Such thermodynamic gradients can lead to non-equilibrium driving forces for the formation and transport of biomolecular condensates. Here, we report how ion gradients impact the transport processes of biomolecular condensates on the mesoscale and biomolecules on the microscale. Utilizing a microfluidic platform, we demonstrate that the presence of ion concentration gradients can accelerate the transport of biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, via diffusiophoresis. This hydrodynamic transport process allows localized enrichment of biomolecules, thereby promoting the location-specific formation of biomolecular condensates via phase separation. The ion gradients further impart active motility of condensates, allowing them to exhibit enhanced diffusion along the gradient. Coupled with reentrant phase behavior, the gradient-induced active motility leads to a dynamical redistribution of condensates that ultimately extends their lifetime. Together, our results demonstrate diffusiophoresis as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic force that governs the formation and active transport of biomolecular condensates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments generally require sub-nanomolar protein concentrations to isolate single protein molecules, which makes such experiments challenging in live cells due to high intracellular protein concentrations. Here, we show that single-molecule observations can be achieved in live cells through a drastic reduction in the observation volume using overmilled zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs - subwavelength-size holes in a metal film). Overmilling of the ZMW in a palladium film creates a nanowell of tunable size in the glass layer below the aperture, which cells can penetrate. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental characterization of the optical properties of these nanowells over a wide range of ZMW diameters and overmilling depths, showing an excellent signal confinement and a five-fold fluorescence enhancement of fluorescent molecules inside nanowells. ZMW nanowells facilitate live-cell imaging, as cells form stable protrusions into the nanowells. Importantly, the nanowells greatly reduce cytoplasmic background fluorescence, enabling detection of individual membrane-bound fluorophores in the presence of high cytoplasmic expression levels, which could not be achieved with TIRF microscopy. Zero-mode waveguide nanowells thus provide great potential to study individual proteins in living cells.
