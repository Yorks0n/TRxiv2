S.\nScore: 37.3, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558479\nThe interactions between bacteria and phages--viruses that infect bacteria--play critical roles in agriculture, ecology, and medicine; however, how these interactions influence the spatial organization of both bacteria and phages remain largely unexplored. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by developing a theoretical model of motile, proliferating bacteria that aggregate via motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and encounter phage that infect and lyse the cells. We find that the non-reciprocal predator-prey interactions between phage and bacteria strongly alter spatial organization, in some cases giving rise to a rich array of finite-scale stationary and dynamic patterns in which bacteria and phage coexist. We establish principles describing the onset and characteristics of these diverse behaviors, thereby helping to provide a biophysical basis for understanding pattern formation in bacteria-phage systems, as well as in a broader range of active and living systems with similar predator-prey or other non-reciprocal interactions.\nMesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the active, crowded cytoplasm\nAuthors: Shu, T.; Mitra, G.; Alberts, J. B.; Viana, M.; Levy, E. D.; Hocky, G. M.; Holt, L. J.\nScore: 23.0, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558334\nThe mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells1. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through in vitro reconstitution2. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: They are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes3. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, actomyosin dynamics potentiate droplet growth by reducing confinement and elasticity in the mammalian cytoplasm, thereby enabling synDrop coarsening. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation in vivo.\nMarangoni-like tissue flows enhance symmetry breaking of embryonic organoids\nAuthors: Gsell, S.; Tlili, S. L.; Merkel, M.; Lenne, P.-F.\nScore: 18.8, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559003\nDuring early development of multi-cellular animals, cells self-organize to set up the body axes, such as the primary head-to-tail axis, based on which the later body plan is defined. Several signaling pathways are known to control body axis formation. Here, we show, however, that tissue mechanics plays an important role during this process. We focus on the emergence of a primary axis in initially spherical aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, which mirrors events in the early mouse embryo. These aggregates break rotational symmetry to establish an axial organization with domains of different expression profiles, e.g. of the transcription factor T/Bra and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Combining quantitative microscopy and physical modeling, we identify largescale tissue flows with a recirculation component and demonstrate that they significantly contribute to symmetry breaking. We show that the recirculating flows are explained by a difference in tissue surface tension across domains, akin to Marangoni flows, which we further confirm by aggregate fusion experiments. Our work highlights that body axis formation is not only driven by biochemical processes, but that it can also be amplified by tissue flows. We expect this type of amplification to operate in many other organoid and in-vivo systems.\nRegeneration of actin filament branches from the same Arp2/3 complex\nAuthors: Ghasemi, F.; Cao, L.; Mladenov, M.; Guichard, B.; Way, M.; Jegou, A.; Romet-Lemonne, G.\nScore: 18.7, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.558980\nBranched actin filaments are found in many key cellular structures. Branches are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex activated by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) proteins and bound to the side of pre-existing mother filaments. Over time, branches dissociate from their mother filament, leading to network reorganization and turnover, but this mechanism is less understood. Here, using microfluidics and purified proteins, we examined the dissociation of individual branches under controlled biochemical and mechanical conditions. We observe that Arp2/3 remains bound to the mother filament after most debranching events, even when accelerated by force. Unexpectedly, this mother-remaining Arp2/3 readily nucleates a new actin filament branch, without being activated anew by an NPF: it simply needs to exchange its nucleotide and bind an actin monomer. The protein GMF, which accelerates debranching, prevents branch re-nucleation. Our results suggest that actin filament re-nucleation can provide a self-repair mechanism, helping branched networks to sustain mechanical stress in cells over extended periods of time.\nA model for collagen secretion by intercompartmental continuities\nAuthors: Bunel, L.; Pincet, L.; Malhotra, V.; Raote, I.; Pincet, F.\nScore: 15.5, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558805\nNewly synthesized secretory proteins are exported from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at specialized sub-compartments called exit sites (ERES). Cargoes like procollagen are too large for export by the standard COPII-coated vesicle of 60 nm average diameter. We have previously suggested that procollagen is transported from the ER to the next secretory organelle, the ERGIC, in TANGO1-dependent inter-organelle tunnels. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered domains of TANGO1 in the ER lumen generate an entropic contraction that pulls procollagen towards the ERES. Molecular gradients of pH and HSP47 between the ER and ERGIC generate a force in the range of tens of femtoNewtons (fN), which is sufficient to propel procollagen from the ER at a speed of ~1 nm.s-1. This calculated speed and the quantities of collagen secreted are similar to its observed physiological secretion rate in fibroblasts, consistent with the proposal that ER export is the rate limiting step for procollagen secretion. Our theoretical model explains how cells can utilize molecular gradients to export procollagens at a rate commensurate with physiological needs.\nLipid peroxidation drives liquid-liquid phase separation and disrupts raft protein partitioning in biological membranes\nAuthors: Balakrishnan, M.; Kenworthy, A. K.\nScore: 15.3, Published: 2023-09-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.557355\nThe peroxidation of membrane lipids by free radicals contributes to aging, numerous diseases, and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Peroxidation changes the structure, conformation and physicochemical properties of lipids, leading to major membrane alterations including bilayer thinning, altered fluidity, and increased permeability. Whether and how lipid peroxidation impacts the lateral organization of proteins and lipids in biological membranes, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we employ cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) as a model to investigate the impact of lipid peroxidation on ordered membrane domains, often termed membrane rafts. We show that lipid peroxidation induced by the Fenton reaction dramatically enhances phase separation propensity of GPMVs into co-existing liquid ordered (raft) and liquid disordered (non-raft) domains and increases the relative abundance of the disordered, non-raft phase. Peroxidation also leads to preferential accumulation of peroxidized lipids and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts in the disordered phase, decreased lipid packing in both raft and non-raft domains, and translocation of multiple classes of proteins out of rafts. These findings indicate that peroxidation of plasma membrane lipids disturbs many aspects of membrane rafts, including their stability, abundance, packing, and protein and lipid composition. We propose that these disruptions contribute to the pathological consequences of lipid peroxidation during aging and disease, and thus serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\nConserved nucleocytoplasmic density homeostasis drives cellular organization across eukaryotes\nAuthors: Biswas, A.; Munoz, O.; Kim, K.; Hoege, C.; Lorton, B. M.; Shechter, D.; Guck, J.; Zaburdaev, V.; Reber, S.\nScore: 82.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556409\nThe packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.\nIncorporating prior knowledge to seeds of adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations of ligand transport in enzymes with buried active sites\nAuthors: Sarkar, D. K.; Surpeta, B.; Brezovsky, J.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558608\nGiven that most proteins have buried active sites, protein tunnels or channels play a crucial role in mitigating the transport of small molecules to the buried cavity for enzymatic catalysis. Tunnels can critically modulate the biological process of protein-ligand recognition. Various molecular dynamics methods have been developed for exploring and exploiting the protein-ligand conformational space to extract high-resolution details of the binding processes, one of the most recent represented by energetically unbiased high-throughput adaptive sampling simulations. The current study systematically contrasts the role of integrating prior knowledge while generating useful initial protein-ligand configurations, called seeds, for these simulations. Using a non-trivial system of haloalkane dehalogenase mutant with multiple transport tunnels leading to a deeply buried active site, these simulations were employed to derive kinetic models describing the process of association and dissociation of the substrate molecule. The more knowledge-based seed generation enabled high-throughput simulations that could more consistently capture the entire transport process, effectively explore the complex network of transport tunnels, and predict equilibrium dissociation constants, koff/kon, on the same order of magnitude as experimental measurements. Overall, the infusion of more knowledge into the initial seeds of adaptive sampling simulations could render analyses of transport mechanisms in enzymes more consistent even for very complex biomolecular systems, thereby promoting the rational design of enzymes with buried active sites and drug development efforts.\n4D Mesoscale liquid model of nucleus resolves chromatin's radial organization\nAuthors: Laghmach, R.; Di Pierro, M.; Potoyan, D.\nScore: 8.1, Published: 2023-09-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.21.558819\nRecent chromatin capture, imaging techniques, and polymer modeling advancements have dramatically enhanced our quantitative understanding of chromosomal folding. However, the dynamism inherent in genome architectures due to physical and biochemical forces and their impact on nuclear architecture and cellular functions remains elusive. While imaging techniques capable of probing the physical properties of chromatin in 4D are growing, there is a conspicuous lack of physics-based computational tools appropriate for revealing the underlying forces that shape nuclear architecture and dynamics. To this end, we have developed a multi-phase liquid model of the nucleus, which can resolve chromosomal territories, compartments, and nuclear lamina using a physics-based and data-informed free energy function. The model enables rapid hypothesis-driven prototyping of nuclear dynamics in 4D, thereby facilitating comparison with whole nucleus imaging experiments. As an application, we model the Drosophila nucleus spanning the interphase and map phase diagram of nuclear morphologies. We shed light on the interplay of adhesive and cohesive interactions within the nucleus, giving rise to distinct radial organization seen in conventional, inverted, and senescent nuclear architectures. The results also show the highly dynamic nature of the radial organization, the disruption of which leads to significant variability in domain coarsening dynamics and, consequently, variability of chromatin architecture. The model also highlights the impact of oblate nuclear geometry and heterochromatin sub-type interactions on the global chromatin architecture and local asymmetry of chromatin compartments.\nSpatio-temporal Coordination of Active Deformation Forces and Wnt / Hippo-Yap Signaling in Hydra Regeneration\nAuthors: Suzuki, R.; Hiraiwa, T.; Tursch, A.; Hoger, S.; Hayashi, K.; Ozbek, S.; Holstein, T. W.; Tanaka, M.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.558226\nAmple evidence suggests that Wnt signaling and tissue deformation are key determinants for pattern formation in animals. The coordination of these biochemical and biomechanical spatio-temporal asymmetries is often unknown or controversial. We investigated this relationship by studying regeneration in the freshwater polyp Hydra. In both reaggregates of dissociated cells and tissue regenerates, we found significant tissue contraction waves and upregulation of Wnt signaling. Applying a simple mechanical model to the mode analysis of the active deformations, we quantitatively defined the phase reversal of size change and axial deformation in those oscillations as the time point of \"biomechanical\" symmetry breaking. Moreover, overexpression and inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling modulated the timing of this biomechanical symmetry breaking. A direct comparison with the RNAseq data indicates that the biomechanical symmetry breaking occurs only after the upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling. Further data suggest that biochemical signaling and biomechanical active deformation synergistically stabilize the body axis and hence the following head structure formation by Hippo-Yap signaling. The symmetry breaking mechanism identified here in Hydra most likely represents a patterning module that is evolutionary conserved from early metazoan to bilaterian animals.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The interactions between bacteria and phages--viruses that infect bacteria--play critical roles in agriculture, ecology, and medicine; however, how these interactions influence the spatial organization of both bacteria and phages remain largely unexplored. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by developing a theoretical model of motile, proliferating bacteria that aggregate via motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and encounter phage that infect and lyse the cells. We find that the non-reciprocal predator-prey interactions between phage and bacteria strongly alter spatial organization, in some cases giving rise to a rich array of finite-scale stationary and dynamic patterns in which bacteria and phage coexist. We establish principles describing the onset and characteristics of these diverse behaviors, thereby helping to provide a biophysical basis for understanding pattern formation in bacteria-phage systems, as well as in a broader range of active and living systems with similar predator-prey or other non-reciprocal interactions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells1. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through in vitro reconstitution2. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: They are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes3. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, actomyosin dynamics potentiate droplet growth by reducing confinement and elasticity in the mammalian cytoplasm, thereby enabling synDrop coarsening. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">During early development of multi-cellular animals, cells self-organize to set up the body axes, such as the primary head-to-tail axis, based on which the later body plan is defined. Several signaling pathways are known to control body axis formation. Here, we show, however, that tissue mechanics plays an important role during this process. We focus on the emergence of a primary axis in initially spherical aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells, which mirrors events in the early mouse embryo. These aggregates break rotational symmetry to establish an axial organization with domains of different expression profiles, e.g. of the transcription factor T/Bra and the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Combining quantitative microscopy and physical modeling, we identify largescale tissue flows with a recirculation component and demonstrate that they significantly contribute to symmetry breaking. We show that the recirculating flows are explained by a difference in tissue surface tension across domains, akin to Marangoni flows, which we further confirm by aggregate fusion experiments. Our work highlights that body axis formation is not only driven by biochemical processes, but that it can also be amplified by tissue flows. We expect this type of amplification to operate in many other organoid and in-vivo systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Branched actin filaments are found in many key cellular structures. Branches are nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex activated by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) proteins and bound to the side of pre-existing  mother filaments. Over time, branches dissociate from their mother filament, leading to network reorganization and turnover, but this mechanism is less understood. Here, using microfluidics and purified proteins, we examined the dissociation of individual branches under controlled biochemical and mechanical conditions. We observe that Arp2/3 remains bound to the mother filament after most debranching events, even when accelerated by force. Unexpectedly, this mother-remaining Arp2/3 readily nucleates a new actin filament branch, without being activated anew by an NPF: it simply needs to exchange its nucleotide and bind an actin monomer. The protein GMF, which accelerates debranching, prevents branch re-nucleation. Our results suggest that actin filament re-nucleation can provide a self-repair mechanism, helping branched networks to sustain mechanical stress in cells over extended periods of time.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Newly synthesized secretory proteins are exported from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at specialized sub-compartments called exit sites (ERES). Cargoes like procollagen are too large for export by the standard COPII-coated vesicle of 60 nm average diameter. We have previously suggested that procollagen is transported from the ER to the next secretory organelle, the ERGIC, in TANGO1-dependent inter-organelle tunnels. Here, we show that intrinsically disordered domains of TANGO1 in the ER lumen generate an entropic contraction that pulls procollagen towards the ERES. Molecular gradients of pH and HSP47 between the ER and ERGIC generate a force in the range of tens of femtoNewtons (fN), which is sufficient to propel procollagen from the ER at a speed of ~1 nm.s-1. This calculated speed and the quantities of collagen secreted are similar to its observed physiological secretion rate in fibroblasts, consistent with the proposal that ER export is the rate limiting step for procollagen secretion. Our theoretical model explains how cells can utilize molecular gradients to export procollagens at a rate commensurate with physiological needs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The peroxidation of membrane lipids by free radicals contributes to aging, numerous diseases, and ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Peroxidation changes the structure, conformation and physicochemical properties of lipids, leading to major membrane alterations including bilayer thinning, altered fluidity, and increased permeability. Whether and how lipid peroxidation impacts the lateral organization of proteins and lipids in biological membranes, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we employ cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) as a model to investigate the impact of lipid peroxidation on ordered membrane domains, often termed membrane rafts. We show that lipid peroxidation induced by the Fenton reaction dramatically enhances phase separation propensity of GPMVs into co-existing liquid ordered (raft) and liquid disordered (non-raft) domains and increases the relative abundance of the disordered, non-raft phase. Peroxidation also leads to preferential accumulation of peroxidized lipids and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts in the disordered phase, decreased lipid packing in both raft and non-raft domains, and translocation of multiple classes of proteins out of rafts. These findings indicate that peroxidation of plasma membrane lipids disturbs many aspects of membrane rafts, including their stability, abundance, packing, and protein and lipid composition. We propose that these disruptions contribute to the pathological consequences of lipid peroxidation during aging and disease, and thus serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Given that most proteins have buried active sites, protein tunnels or channels play a crucial role in mitigating the transport of small molecules to the buried cavity for enzymatic catalysis. Tunnels can critically modulate the biological process of protein-ligand recognition. Various molecular dynamics methods have been developed for exploring and exploiting the protein-ligand conformational space to extract high-resolution details of the binding processes, one of the most recent represented by energetically unbiased high-throughput adaptive sampling simulations. The current study systematically contrasts the role of integrating prior knowledge while generating useful initial protein-ligand configurations, called seeds, for these simulations. Using a non-trivial system of haloalkane dehalogenase mutant with multiple transport tunnels leading to a deeply buried active site, these simulations were employed to derive kinetic models describing the process of association and dissociation of the substrate molecule. The more knowledge-based seed generation enabled high-throughput simulations that could more consistently capture the entire transport process, effectively explore the complex network of transport tunnels, and predict equilibrium dissociation constants, koff/kon, on the same order of magnitude as experimental measurements. Overall, the infusion of more knowledge into the initial seeds of adaptive sampling simulations could render analyses of transport mechanisms in enzymes more consistent even for very complex biomolecular systems, thereby promoting the rational design of enzymes with buried active sites and drug development efforts.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recent chromatin capture, imaging techniques, and polymer modeling advancements have dramatically enhanced our quantitative understanding of chromosomal folding. However, the dynamism inherent in genome architectures due to physical and biochemical forces and their impact on nuclear architecture and cellular functions remains elusive. While imaging techniques capable of probing the physical properties of chromatin in 4D are growing, there is a conspicuous lack of physics-based computational tools appropriate for revealing the underlying forces that shape nuclear architecture and dynamics. To this end, we have developed a multi-phase liquid model of the nucleus, which can resolve chromosomal territories, compartments, and nuclear lamina using a physics-based and data-informed free energy function. The model enables rapid hypothesis-driven prototyping of nuclear dynamics in 4D, thereby facilitating comparison with whole nucleus imaging experiments. As an application, we model the Drosophila nucleus spanning the interphase and map phase diagram of nuclear morphologies. We shed light on the interplay of adhesive and cohesive interactions within the nucleus, giving rise to distinct radial organization seen in conventional, inverted, and senescent nuclear architectures. The results also show the highly dynamic nature of the radial organization, the disruption of which leads to significant variability in domain coarsening dynamics and, consequently, variability of chromatin architecture. The model also highlights the impact of oblate nuclear geometry and heterochromatin sub-type interactions on the global chromatin architecture and local asymmetry of chromatin compartments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Ample evidence suggests that Wnt signaling and tissue deformation are key determinants for pattern formation in animals. The coordination of these biochemical and biomechanical spatio-temporal asymmetries is often unknown or controversial. We investigated this relationship by studying regeneration in the freshwater polyp Hydra. In both reaggregates of dissociated cells and tissue regenerates, we found significant tissue contraction waves and upregulation of Wnt signaling. Applying a simple mechanical model to the mode analysis of the active deformations, we quantitatively defined the phase reversal of size change and axial deformation in those oscillations as the time point of &#34;biomechanical&#34; symmetry breaking. Moreover, overexpression and inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling modulated the timing of this biomechanical symmetry breaking. A direct comparison with the RNAseq data indicates that the biomechanical symmetry breaking occurs only after the upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling. Further data suggest that biochemical signaling and biomechanical active deformation synergistically stabilize the body axis and hence the following head structure formation by Hippo-Yap signaling. The symmetry breaking mechanism identified here in Hydra most likely represents a patterning module that is evolutionary conserved from early metazoan to bilaterian animals.</p>
