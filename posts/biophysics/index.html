W.; Muenster, L.; Schoenherr, R.; Heinemann, S. H.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.560122\nGenetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are powerful, non-invasive tools for recording action potentials in excitable cells. However, most animal cell types are non-excitable, and yet variations in the membrane potential are biologically relevant in these cells as well. Resolving such small voltage signals demands GEVIs with exceptionally high sensitivity. In this study, we applied structure-guided engineering to the GEVI ASAP3 to generate rEstus, a sensor with optimized brightness, voltage sensitivity, and voltage range. rEstus is most sensitive in the resting voltage range of non-excitable cells, exhibits a 3.6-fold improvement in fast voltage spike detection, and allows for absolute voltage calibration at the single-cell level. Using rEstus, we resolved endogenous voltage fluctuations in several non-excitable cell types and demonstrate that correlation analysis of these optically recorded fluctuations provides an easy, non-invasive, real-time readout of electrical gap-junction coupling. Our work provides greatly enhanced tools and methods for the non-invasive study of electrical signaling in excitable and non-excitable cells.\nArchitecture and rearrangements of a sperm-specific Na+/H+ exchanger\nAuthors: Pal, K.; Chowdhury, S.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560940\nThe sperm-specific sodium hydrogen exchanger, SLC9C1, underlies hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide stimulated proton fluxes across sperm membranes and regulates their hyperactivated motility. SLC9C1 is the first known instance of an ion transporter that uses a canonical voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and an evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) to influence the dynamics of its ion-exchange domain (ED). The structural organization of this tripartite transporter and the mechanisms whereby it integrates physical (membrane voltage) and chemical (cyclic nucleotide) cues are unknown. In this study, we use single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of a metazoan SLC9C1 in different conformational states. We find that the three structural domains are uniquely organized around a distinct ring-shaped scaffold that we call the allosteric ring domainor ARD. The ARD undergoes coupled proton-dependent rearrangements with the ED and acts as a signaling hub enabling allosteric communication between the key functional modules of sp9C1. We demonstrate that binding of cAMP causes large conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains and disrupts key ARD-linked interfaces. We propose that these structural changes rescue the transmembrane domains from an auto-inhibited state and facilitate their functional dynamics. Our study provides a structural framework to understand and further probe electrochemical linkage in SLC9C1.\nBiomolecular condensates form spatially inhomogeneous network fluids\nAuthors: Dar, F.; Cohen, S. R.; Mitrea, D. M.; Phillips, A. H.; Nagy, G.; Leite, W. C.; Stanley, C. B.; Choi, J.-M.; Kriwacki, R. W.; Pappu, R. V.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-10-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.07.561338\nThe functions of biomolecular condensates are thought to be influenced by their material properties, and these are in turn determined by the multiscale structural features within condensates. However, structural characterizations of condensates are challenging, and hence rarely reported. Here, we deploy a combination of small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and bespoke coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to provide structural descriptions of model condensates that mimic nucleolar granular components (GCs). We show that facsimiles of GCs are network fluids featuring spatial inhomogeneities across hierarchies of length scales that reflect the contributions of distinct protein and peptide domains. The network-like inhomogeneous organization is characterized by a coexistence of liquid- and gas-like macromolecular densities that engenders bimodality of internal molecular dynamics. These insights, extracted from a combination of approaches, suggest that condensates formed by multivalent proteins share features with network fluids formed by associative systems such as patchy or hairy colloids.\nStructural basis of transcription: RNA Polymerase II substrate binding and metal coordination at 3.0 A using a free-electron laser\nAuthors: Guowu, L.; Barnes, C. O.; Weiss, S.; Dutagaci, B.; Qiu, C.; Feig, M.; Lyubimov, A.; Song, J.; Cohen, A. E.; Kaplan, C. D.; Calero, G.\nScore: 7.3, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.22.559052\nCatalysis and translocation of multi-subunit DNA-directed RNA polymerases underlie all cellular mRNA synthesis. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) synthesizes eukaryotic pre-mRNAs from a DNA template strand buried in its active site. Structural details of catalysis at near atomic resolution and precise arrangement of key active site components have been elusive. Here we present the free electron laser (FEL) structure of a matched ATP-bound Pol II, revealing the full active site interaction network at the highest resolution to date, including the trigger loop (TL) in the closed conformation, bonafide occupancy of both site A and B Mg2+, and a putative third (site C) Mg2+ analogous to that described for some DNA polymerases but not observed previously for cellular RNA polymerases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the structure indicate that the third Mg2+ is coordinated and stabilized at its observed position. TL residues provide half of the substrate binding pocket while multiple TL/bridge helix (BH) interactions induce conformational changes that could propel translocation upon substrate hydrolysis. Consistent with TL/BH communication, a FEL structure and MD simulations of the hyperactive Rpb1 T834P bridge helix mutant reveals rearrangement of some active site interactions supporting potential plasticity in active site function and long-distance effects on both the width of the central channel and TL conformation, likely underlying its increased elongation rate at the expense of fidelity.\nSingle-molecule analysis reveals TDG exhibits multiple modes of linear diffusion to process 5-formylcytosine.\nAuthors: Schnable, B. L.; Schaich, M. A.; Roginskaya, V.; Leary, L. P.; Weaver, T. M.; Freudenthal, B. D.; Drohat, A. C.; Van Houten, B.\nScore: 5.9, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.560925\nDNA methylation plays a key role in epigenetics, with 60-80% of CpG sites containing 5-methylcytosine. Base excision repair (BER) is suggested to be the main pathway involved in active DNA demethylation. 5-formylctyosine (5fC), an oxidized moiety of methylated cytosine, is recognized and removed by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) to generate an abasic site. TDG binds avidly to abasic sites and is product inhibited. Using single molecule fluorescence experiments, we saw TDG interact with DNA containing 5fC specifically and non-specifically with lifetimes of 72.9 and 7.5 seconds, respectively. These results indicate that TDG cleaves the 5fC and stays bound for an extended time at the generated abasic site. Mean squared displacement analysis and a two color TDG experiment indicate that TDG exhibits multiple modes of linear diffusion, including hopping and sliding, in search of a lesion. The catalytically crippled variants, N140A and R275A/L, have a reduced binding lifetime compared to wild type and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) analysis indicates that R275L/A moves on the DNA with a faster diffusivity. These results indicate that mutating R275, but not N140 interferes with damage recognition by TDG. Our findings give insight into how TDG searches for its lesions in long stretches of undamaged DNA.\nChromatinization Modulates Topoisomerase II Processivity\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Wu, M.; Inman, J.; Singh, G.; Park, S. h.; Lee, J. H.; Fulbright, R. M.; Hong, Y.; Jeong, J. D.; Berger, J. M.; Wang, M. D.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560726\nType IIA topoisomerases are essential DNA processing enzymes that must robustly and reliably relax DNA torsional stress in vivo. While cellular processes constantly create different degrees of torsional stress, how this stress feeds back to control type IIA topoisomerase function remains obscure. Using a suite of single-molecule approaches, we examined the torsional impact on supercoiling relaxation of both naked DNA and chromatin by eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II). We observed that topo II was at least [~] 50-fold more processive on plectonemic DNA than previously estimated, capable of relaxing \u003e 6000 turns. We further discovered that topo II could relax supercoiled DNA prior to plectoneme formation, but with a [~]100-fold reduction in processivity; strikingly, the relaxation rate in this regime decreased with diminishing torsion in a manner consistent with the capture of transient DNA loops by topo II. Chromatinization preserved the high processivity of the enzyme under high torsional stress. Interestingly, topo II was still highly processive ([~] 1000 turns) even under low torsional stress, consistent with the predisposition of chromatin to readily form DNA crossings. This work establishes that chromatin is a major stimulant of topo II function, capable of enhancing function even under low torsional stress.\nSeparation of sticker-spacer energetics governs the coalescence of biomolecular condensates\nAuthors: Chattaraj, A.; Shakhnovich, E. I.\nScore: 3.9, Published: 2023-10-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560747\nBiopolymer condensates often emerge as a multi-droplet state and never coalesce into one large droplet within the experimental timespan. This contradicts the prediction of classical polymer physics which suggests the existence of one large droplet beyond the phase transition. Previous work revealed that the sticker-spacer architecture of biopolymers may dynamically stabilize the multi-droplet state. Here, we simulate the condensate coalescence using metadynamics approach and reveal two distinct physical mechanisms underlying the fusion of droplets. Condensates made of sticker-spacer polymers readily undergo a kinetic arrest when stickers exhibit slow exchange while fast exchanging stickers at similar levels of saturation allow merger to equilibrium states. On the other hand, condensates composed of homopolymers fuse readily until they reach a threshold density. We also show that the inter-condensate exchange of chains offers a general mechanism that drives the fusion. We map the range of mechanisms of kinetic arrest from slow sticker exchange dynamics to density mediated in terms of energetic separation of stickers and spacers. In that vein, our simulations predict that the biological condensates may show a re-entrant dynamic merger behavior at a particular range of sticker-spacer energetics. Mechanistic underpinnings revealed in this work have broader implications in polymer physics and condensate biology.\nMesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the active, crowded cytoplasm\nAuthors: Shu, T.; Mitra, G.; Alberts, J. B.; Viana, M.; Levy, E. D.; Hocky, G. M.; Holt, L. J.\nScore: 26.3, Published: 2023-09-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.558334\nThe mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells1. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through in vitro reconstitution2. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: They are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes3. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, actomyosin dynamics potentiate droplet growth by reducing confinement and elasticity in the mammalian cytoplasm, thereby enabling synDrop coarsening. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation in vivo.\nShort N-terminal disordered regions and the proline-rich domain are major regulators of phase transitions for full-length UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4\nAuthors: Dao, T. P.; Rajendran, A.; Galagedera, S. K. K.; Haws, W.; Castaneda, C. A.\nScore: 13.0, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559790\nHighly homologous ubiquitin-binding shuttle proteins UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 differ in both their specific protein quality control functions and their propensities to localize to stress-induced condensates, cellular aggregates and aggresomes. We previously showed that UBQLN2 phase separates in vitro, and that the phase separation propensities of UBQLN2 deletion constructs correlate with their ability to form condensates in cells. Here, we demonstrated that full-length UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 exhibit distinct phase behaviors in vitro. Strikingly, UBQLN4 phase separates at a much lower saturation concentration than UBQLN1. However, neither UBQLN1 nor UBQLN4 phase separates with a strong temperature dependence, unlike UBQLN2. We determined that the temperature-dependent phase behavior of UBQLN2 stems from its unique proline-rich (Pxx) region, which is absent in the other UBQLNs. We found that the short N-terminal disordered regions of UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 inhibit UBQLN phase separation via electrostatics interactions. Charge variants of the N-terminal regions exhibit altered phase behaviors. Consistent with the sensitivity of UBQLN phase separation to the composition of the N-terminal regions, epitope tags placed on the N-termini of the UBQLNs tune phase separation. Overall, our in vitro results have important implications for studies of UBQLNs in cells, including the identification of phase separation as a potential mechanism to distinguish the cellular roles of UBQLNs, and the need to apply caution when using epitope tags to prevent experimental artifacts. Highlights1) Full-length UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 all exhibit LCST phase transitions but to different degrees. 2) The N-terminal region (N-terminal to the UBL) substantially regulates UBQLN phase separation. 3) Removal of the disease-associated proline-rich (Pxx) region in UBQLN2 removes the strong temperature dependence of UBQLN2 phase separation.\nMechanical imbalance between normal and cancer cells drives epithelial defence against cancer\nAuthors: Gupta, P.; Kayal, S.; Pothapragada, S. P.; Senapati, H. K.; Devendran, P.; Bi, D.; Das, T.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2023-09-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.27.559723\nCell competition enables normal wildtype cells of epithelial tissue to eliminate mutant cells expressing activated oncoproteins such as HRasV12. However, the driving force behind this fundamental form of epithelial defence against cancer remains enigmatic. Here, we employ tissue stress microscopy, theoretical modelling, and a new collective compressibility measurement technique called gel compression microscopy to unveil the mechanism governing competition. Stress microscopy reveals unique compressive stress experienced by the mutant cells, contrasting with predominantly tensile stress experienced by normal cells. A cell-based computer simulation of the process then predicts that this compressive stress arises out of a mechanical imbalance between two competing populations due to a difference in their collective compressibility and rigidity. Gel compression microscopy then empirically confirms that the mutant population is three times more compressible than the normal population. Mechanistically, this difference stems from the lower abundance and coupling of junctional E-cadherin in the mutant cells, which weakens cell-cell adhesions, rendering the mutant population more compressible. Taken together, our study elucidates the physical principle and underlying molecular mechanism driving cell competition in epithelial defence against cancer, opening new directions for mechanomedicine.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are powerful, non-invasive tools for recording action potentials in excitable cells. However, most animal cell types are non-excitable, and yet variations in the membrane potential are biologically relevant in these cells as well. Resolving such small voltage signals demands GEVIs with exceptionally high sensitivity. In this study, we applied structure-guided engineering to the GEVI ASAP3 to generate rEstus, a sensor with optimized brightness, voltage sensitivity, and voltage range. rEstus is most sensitive in the resting voltage range of non-excitable cells, exhibits a 3.6-fold improvement in fast voltage spike detection, and allows for absolute voltage calibration at the single-cell level. Using rEstus, we resolved endogenous voltage fluctuations in several non-excitable cell types and demonstrate that correlation analysis of these optically recorded fluctuations provides an easy, non-invasive, real-time readout of electrical gap-junction coupling. Our work provides greatly enhanced tools and methods for the non-invasive study of electrical signaling in excitable and non-excitable cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The sperm-specific sodium hydrogen exchanger, SLC9C1, underlies hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide stimulated proton fluxes across sperm membranes and regulates their hyperactivated motility. SLC9C1 is the first known instance of an ion transporter that uses a canonical voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and an evolutionarily conserved cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) to influence the dynamics of its ion-exchange domain (ED). The structural organization of this tripartite transporter and the mechanisms whereby it integrates physical (membrane voltage) and chemical (cyclic nucleotide) cues are unknown. In this study, we use single particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of a metazoan SLC9C1 in different conformational states. We find that the three structural domains are uniquely organized around a distinct ring-shaped scaffold that we call the allosteric ring domainor ARD. The ARD undergoes coupled proton-dependent rearrangements with the ED and acts as a signaling hub enabling allosteric communication between the key functional modules of sp9C1. We demonstrate that binding of cAMP causes large conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains and disrupts key ARD-linked interfaces. We propose that these structural changes rescue the transmembrane domains from an auto-inhibited state and facilitate their functional dynamics. Our study provides a structural framework to understand and further probe electrochemical linkage in SLC9C1.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The functions of biomolecular condensates are thought to be influenced by their material properties, and these are in turn determined by the multiscale structural features within condensates. However, structural characterizations of condensates are challenging, and hence rarely reported. Here, we deploy a combination of small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and bespoke coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to provide structural descriptions of model condensates that mimic nucleolar granular components (GCs). We show that facsimiles of GCs are network fluids featuring spatial inhomogeneities across hierarchies of length scales that reflect the contributions of distinct protein and peptide domains. The network-like inhomogeneous organization is characterized by a coexistence of liquid- and gas-like macromolecular densities that engenders bimodality of internal molecular dynamics. These insights, extracted from a combination of approaches, suggest that condensates formed by multivalent proteins share features with network fluids formed by associative systems such as patchy or hairy colloids.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Catalysis and translocation of multi-subunit DNA-directed RNA polymerases underlie all cellular mRNA synthesis. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) synthesizes eukaryotic pre-mRNAs from a DNA template strand buried in its active site. Structural details of catalysis at near atomic resolution and precise arrangement of key active site components have been elusive. Here we present the free electron laser (FEL) structure of a matched ATP-bound Pol II, revealing the full active site interaction network at the highest resolution to date, including the trigger loop (TL) in the closed conformation, bonafide occupancy of both site A and B Mg2&#43;, and a putative third (site C) Mg2&#43; analogous to that described for some DNA polymerases but not observed previously for cellular RNA polymerases. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the structure indicate that the third Mg2&#43; is coordinated and stabilized at its observed position. TL residues provide half of the substrate binding pocket while multiple TL/bridge helix (BH) interactions induce conformational changes that could propel translocation upon substrate hydrolysis. Consistent with TL/BH communication, a FEL structure and MD simulations of the hyperactive Rpb1 T834P bridge helix mutant reveals rearrangement of some active site interactions supporting potential plasticity in active site function and long-distance effects on both the width of the central channel and TL conformation, likely underlying its increased elongation rate at the expense of fidelity.</p>

        <p class="abstract">DNA methylation plays a key role in epigenetics, with 60-80% of CpG sites containing 5-methylcytosine. Base excision repair (BER) is suggested to be the main pathway involved in active DNA demethylation. 5-formylctyosine (5fC), an oxidized moiety of methylated cytosine, is recognized and removed by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) to generate an abasic site. TDG binds avidly to abasic sites and is product inhibited. Using single molecule fluorescence experiments, we saw TDG interact with DNA containing 5fC specifically and non-specifically with lifetimes of 72.9 and 7.5 seconds, respectively. These results indicate that TDG cleaves the 5fC and stays bound for an extended time at the generated abasic site. Mean squared displacement analysis and a two color TDG experiment indicate that TDG exhibits multiple modes of linear diffusion, including hopping and sliding, in search of a lesion. The catalytically crippled variants, N140A and R275A/L, have a reduced binding lifetime compared to wild type and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) analysis indicates that R275L/A moves on the DNA with a faster diffusivity. These results indicate that mutating R275, but not N140 interferes with damage recognition by TDG. Our findings give insight into how TDG searches for its lesions in long stretches of undamaged DNA.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type IIA topoisomerases are essential DNA processing enzymes that must robustly and reliably relax DNA torsional stress in vivo. While cellular processes constantly create different degrees of torsional stress, how this stress feeds back to control type IIA topoisomerase function remains obscure. Using a suite of single-molecule approaches, we examined the torsional impact on supercoiling relaxation of both naked DNA and chromatin by eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II). We observed that topo II was at least [~] 50-fold more processive on plectonemic DNA than previously estimated, capable of relaxing &gt; 6000 turns. We further discovered that topo II could relax supercoiled DNA prior to plectoneme formation, but with a [~]100-fold reduction in processivity; strikingly, the relaxation rate in this regime decreased with diminishing torsion in a manner consistent with the capture of transient DNA loops by topo II. Chromatinization preserved the high processivity of the enzyme under high torsional stress. Interestingly, topo II was still highly processive ([~] 1000 turns) even under low torsional stress, consistent with the predisposition of chromatin to readily form DNA crossings. This work establishes that chromatin is a major stimulant of topo II function, capable of enhancing function even under low torsional stress.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biopolymer condensates often emerge as a multi-droplet state and never coalesce into one large droplet within the experimental timespan. This contradicts the prediction of classical polymer physics which suggests the existence of one large droplet beyond the phase transition. Previous work revealed that the sticker-spacer architecture of biopolymers may dynamically stabilize the multi-droplet state. Here, we simulate the condensate coalescence using metadynamics approach and reveal two distinct physical mechanisms underlying the fusion of droplets. Condensates made of sticker-spacer polymers readily undergo a kinetic arrest when stickers exhibit slow exchange while fast exchanging stickers at similar levels of saturation allow merger to equilibrium states. On the other hand, condensates composed of homopolymers fuse readily until they reach a threshold density. We also show that the inter-condensate exchange of chains offers a general mechanism that drives the fusion. We map the range of mechanisms of kinetic arrest from slow sticker exchange dynamics to density mediated in terms of energetic separation of stickers and spacers. In that vein, our simulations predict that the biological condensates may show a re-entrant dynamic merger behavior at a particular range of sticker-spacer energetics. Mechanistic underpinnings revealed in this work have broader implications in polymer physics and condensate biology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells1. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through in vitro reconstitution2. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: They are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes3. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, actomyosin dynamics potentiate droplet growth by reducing confinement and elasticity in the mammalian cytoplasm, thereby enabling synDrop coarsening. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation in vivo.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Highly homologous ubiquitin-binding shuttle proteins UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 differ in both their specific protein quality control functions and their propensities to localize to stress-induced condensates, cellular aggregates and aggresomes. We previously showed that UBQLN2 phase separates in vitro, and that the phase separation propensities of UBQLN2 deletion constructs correlate with their ability to form condensates in cells. Here, we demonstrated that full-length UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 exhibit distinct phase behaviors in vitro. Strikingly, UBQLN4 phase separates at a much lower saturation concentration than UBQLN1. However, neither UBQLN1 nor UBQLN4 phase separates with a strong temperature dependence, unlike UBQLN2. We determined that the temperature-dependent phase behavior of UBQLN2 stems from its unique proline-rich (Pxx) region, which is absent in the other UBQLNs. We found that the short N-terminal disordered regions of UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 inhibit UBQLN phase separation via electrostatics interactions. Charge variants of the N-terminal regions exhibit altered phase behaviors. Consistent with the sensitivity of UBQLN phase separation to the composition of the N-terminal regions, epitope tags placed on the N-termini of the UBQLNs tune phase separation. Overall, our in vitro results have important implications for studies of UBQLNs in cells, including the identification of phase separation as a potential mechanism to distinguish the cellular roles of UBQLNs, and the need to apply caution when using epitope tags to prevent experimental artifacts.

Highlights1) Full-length UBQLN1, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4 all exhibit LCST phase transitions but to different degrees.

2) The N-terminal region (N-terminal to the UBL) substantially regulates UBQLN phase separation.

3) Removal of the disease-associated proline-rich (Pxx) region in UBQLN2 removes the strong temperature dependence of UBQLN2 phase separation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell competition enables normal wildtype cells of epithelial tissue to eliminate mutant cells expressing activated oncoproteins such as HRasV12. However, the driving force behind this fundamental form of epithelial defence against cancer remains enigmatic. Here, we employ tissue stress microscopy, theoretical modelling, and a new collective compressibility measurement technique called gel compression microscopy to unveil the mechanism governing competition. Stress microscopy reveals unique compressive stress experienced by the mutant cells, contrasting with predominantly tensile stress experienced by normal cells. A cell-based computer simulation of the process then predicts that this compressive stress arises out of a mechanical imbalance between two competing populations due to a difference in their collective compressibility and rigidity. Gel compression microscopy then empirically confirms that the mutant population is three times more compressible than the normal population. Mechanistically, this difference stems from the lower abundance and coupling of junctional E-cadherin in the mutant cells, which weakens cell-cell adhesions, rendering the mutant population more compressible. Taken together, our study elucidates the physical principle and underlying molecular mechanism driving cell competition in epithelial defence against cancer, opening new directions for mechanomedicine.</p>
