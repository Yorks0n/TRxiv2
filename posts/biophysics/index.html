Previous methods have often been restricted to working exclusively on volumetric densities, neglecting the potential of incorporating any pre-existing structural knowledge as prior or constraints. In this paper, we present a novel methodology, cryoSTAR, that harnesses atomic model information as structural regularization to elucidate such heterogeneity. Our method uniquely outputs both coarse-grained models and density maps, showcasing the molecular conformational changes at different levels. Validated against four diverse experimental datasets, spanning large complexes, a membrane protein, and a small single-chain protein, our results consistently demonstrate an efficient and effective solution to conformational heterogeneity with minimal human bias. By integrating atomic model insights with cryo-EM data, cryoSTAR represents a meaningful step forward, paving the way for a deeper understanding of dynamic biological processes.1\nSequence-ensemble-function relationships for disordered proteins in live cells\nAuthors: Emenecker, R. J.; Guadalupe, K.; Shamoon, N. M.; Sukenik, S.; Holehouse, A. S.\nScore: 27.0, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564547\nIntrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life and play a variety of essential cellular roles. IDRs exist in a collection of structurally distinct conformers known as an ensemble. IDR amino acid sequence determines its ensemble, which in turn can play an important role in dictating molecular function. Yet a clear link connecting IDR sequence, its ensemble properties, and its molecular function in living cells has not been systematically established. Here, we set out to test this sequence-ensemble-function paradigm using a novel computational method (GOOSE) that enables the rational design of libraries of IDRs by systematically varying specific sequence properties. Using ensemble FRET, we measured the ensemble dimensions of a library of rationally designed IDRs in human-derived cell lines, revealing how IDR sequence influences ensemble dimensions in situ. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between sequence and ensemble can tune an IDRs ability to sense changes in cell volume - a de novo molecular function for these synthetic sequences. Our results establish biophysical rules for intracellular sequence-ensemble relationships, enable a new route for understanding how IDR sequences map to function in live cells, and set the ground for the design of synthetic IDRs with de novo function.\nCryo-EM structure of Slo1 with the auxiliary Î³1 subunit suggests mechanism of depolarization-independent activation\nAuthors: Redhardt, M.; Raunser, S.; Raisch, T.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-11-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.01.565197\nMammalian Ca2+-dependent Slo K+ channels are expressed with {beta} and {gamma} auxiliary subunits that greatly influence voltage- and Ca2+-induced gating, thereby fundamentally altering the behavior of the channel. The four {gamma} subunits reduce the need for voltage-dependent activation, allowing Slo to open in the absence of an action potential. The mechanism of this activation has, however, remained elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of Slo1 in complex with {gamma}1/LRRC26, revealing how the transmembrane helix of {gamma}1 binds and presumably stabilizes the active conformation of the voltage-sensor domain. This effect is further enhanced by a polybasic stretch on the intracellular side of the membrane which locally changes the charge gradient across the membrane. Sequence differences explain why the four {gamma} subunits possess different activation efficiencies. Simultaneous binding of {gamma} and the unrelated {beta} subunits is structurally possible, as both binding sites do not overlap and the {gamma}1 LRR domains are partially flexible. Thus, our data provide a possible explanation for Slo1 regulation by {gamma} subunits, and furthermore suggest a novel mechanism of activation of voltage-gated ion channels by auxiliary subunits and add to the growing knowledge of their complex regulation.\nFast and robust 3D MINFLUX excitation with a variable phase plate\nAuthors: Deguchi, T.; Ries, J.\nScore: 20.2, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.31.564945\nMINFLUX has achieved record resolution in superresolution imaging and single fluorophore tracking. It is based on localizing single fluorophores by rapid probing with a patterned beam that features a local intensity minimum. Current implementations, however, are complex and expensive and are limited in speed and robustness. Here, we show that a combination of an electro-optical modulator with a segmented birefringent element such as a spatial light modulator produces a variable phase plate for which the phase can be scanned on the MHz timescale. Bisected or top-hat phase patterns generate high-contrast compact excitation point-spread functions for MINFLUX localization in the x,y, and z-direction, respectively, which can be scanned around a fluorophore within a microsecond and alternated among different excitation wavelengths. We discuss how to compensate for non-optimal performance of the components and present a robust 3D and multi-color MINFLUX excitation module with record speed, which we envision as an integral component of a high-performance and cost-effective open-source MINFLUX.\n4Pi MINFLUX arrangement maximizes spatio-temporal localization precision of fluorescence emitter\nAuthors: Rickert, J.; Held, M. O.; Engelhardt, J.; Hell, S. W.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564755\nWe introduce MINFLUX localization with interferometric illumination through opposing objective lenses for maximizing the attainable precision in 3D-localization of single inelastic scatterers, such as fluorophores. Our 4Pi optical configuration employs three sequentially tilted counter-propagating beam pairs for illumination, each providing a narrow interference minimum of illumination intensity at the focal point. The localization precision is additionally improved by adding the inelastically scattered (fluorescence) photons collected through both objective lenses. Our 4Pi configuration yields the currently highest precision per detected photon among all localization schemes. Tracking gold nanoparticles as non-blinking inelastic scatterers rendered a position uncertainty \u003c 0.4 nm3 in volume at a localization frequency of 2.9 kHz. We harnessed the record spatio-temporal precision of our 4Pi MINFLUX approach to examine the diffusion of single fluorophores and fluorescent nanobeads in solutions of sucrose in water, revealing local heterogeneities at the nanoscale. Our results show the applicability of 4Pi MINFLUX to study molecular nano-environments of diffusion and its potential for quantifying rapid movements of molecules in cells and other material composites.\nThe genetic architecture of protein stability\nAuthors: Faure, A. J.; Marti-Aranda, A.; Hidalgo, C.; Schmiedel, J. M.; Lehner, B.\nScore: 52.2, Published: 2023-10-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564339\nThere are more ways to synthesize a 100 amino acid protein (20100) than atoms in the universe. Only a miniscule fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces. However, these models are extremely complicated and provide little insight into the fundamental genetic architecture of proteins. Here, by experimentally exploring sequence spaces \u003e1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable biophysical models. These models capture the non-linear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and caused by structural contacts and backbone propagations. Our results suggest that artificial intelligence models may be vastly more complicated than the proteins that they are modeling and that protein genetics is actually both simple and intelligible.\nInsights into Molecular Diversity within the FET Family: Unraveling Phase Separation of the N-Terminal Low Complexity Domain from RNA-Binding Protein EWS\nAuthors: Johnson, C. N.; Sojitra, K. A.; Sohn, E. J.; Moreno-Romero, A. K.; Baudin, A.; Xu, X.; Mittal, J.; Libich, D. S.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.27.564484\nThe FET family proteins, which includes FUS, EWS, and TAF15, are RNA chaperones instrumental in processes such as mRNA maturation, transcriptional regulation, and the DNA damage response. These proteins have clinical significance: chromosomal rearrangements in FET proteins are implicated in Ewing family tumors and related sarcomas. Furthermore, point mutations in FUS and TAF15 are associated with neurodegenerative conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia. The fusion protein EWS::FLI1, the causative mutation of Ewing sarcoma, arises from a genomic translocation that fuses the low-complexity domain (LCD) of EWS (EWSLCD) with the DNA binding domain of the ETS transcription factor FLI1. This fusion not only alters transcriptional programs but also hinders native EWS functions like splicing. However, the precise function of the intrinsically disordered EWSLCD is still a topic of active investigation. Due to its flexible nature, EWSLCD can form transient interactions with itself and other biomolecules, leading to the formation of biomolecular condensates through phase separation - a mechanism thought to be central to the oncogenicity of EWS::FLI1. In our study, we used paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, light microscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to better understand the self-association and phase separation tendencies of EWSLCD. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular events that underpin EWSLCD-mediated biomolecular condensation. Our NMR data suggest tyrosine residues primarily drive the interactions vital for EWSLCD phase separation. Moreover, a higher density and proximity of tyrosine residues amplify the likelihood of condensate formation. Atomistic MD simulations and hydrodynamic experiments revealed that the tyrosine-rich N and C-termini tend to populate compact conformations, establishing unique contact networks, that are connected by a predominantly extended, tyrosine-depleted, linker region. MD simulations provide critical input on the relationship between contacts formed within a single molecule (intramolecular) and inside the condensed phase (intermolecular), and changes in protein conformations upon condensation. These results offer deeper insights into the condensate-forming abilities of the FET proteins and highlights unique structural and functional nuances between EWS and its counterparts, FUS and TAF15.\nInterfacial morphodynamics of proliferating microbial communities\nAuthors: Martinez-Calvo, A.; Trenado-Yuste, C.; Lee, H.; Gore, J.; Wingreen, N. S.; Datta, S. S.\nScore: 35.7, Published: 2023-10-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.23.563665\nIn microbial communities, various cell types often coexist by occupying distinct spatial domains. What determines the shape of the interface between such domains--which in turn influences the interactions between cells and overall community function? Here, we address this question by developing a continuum model of a 2D spatially-structured microbial community with two distinct cell types. We find that, depending on the balance of the different cell proliferation rates and substrate friction coefficients, the interface between domains is either stable and smooth, or unstable and develops finger-like protrusions. We establish quantitative principles describing when these different interfacial behaviors arise, and find good agreement both with the results of previous experimental reports as well as new experiments performed here. Our work thus helps to provide a biophysical basis for understanding the interfacial morphodynamics of proliferating microbial communities, as well as a broader range of proliferating active systems.\nNuclear deformation and dynamics of migrating cells in 3D confinement reveal adaptation of pulling and pushing forces\nAuthors: Stoeberl, S.; Flommersfeld, J.; Kreft, M.; Benoit, M.; Broedersz, C.; Raedler, J. O.\nScore: 7.8, Published: 2023-11-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.30.564765\nEukaryotic cells show an astounding ability to migrate through pores and constrictions smaller than their nuclear diameter. However, the forces engaged in nuclear deformation and their effect on confined cell dynamics remain unclear. Here, we study the mechanics and dynamics of nuclei of mesenchymal cancer cells as they spontaneously and repeatedly transition through 3D compliant hydrogel channels. We find a biphasic dependence of migration speed and transition frequency on channel width, revealing maximal transition rates at widths comparable to the nuclear diameter. Using confocal imaging and hydrogel bead displacement, we determine the nuclear deformation and corresponding forces during spontaneous confined migration. We find the nucleus to reversibly deform with an elastic modulus not adapting to the confinement. Instead, with decreasing channel width, the nuclear shape during transmigration changes biphasically concomitant with the transitioning dynamics. The nucleus exhibits a prolate form along the migration direction in wide channels and a more compressed oblate shape in narrow channels. We propose a physical model for confined cell migration that explains the observed nuclear shapes and slowing down in terms of the cytoskeletal force-generation adapting from a pulling-to a pushing-dominated mechanism with increasing nuclear confinement.\nCritical capillary waves of biomolecular condensates\nAuthors: Shimobayashi, S. F.; Konishi, K.; Ackerman, P. J.; Taniguchi, T.; brangwynne, C. P.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-11-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.29.564316\nMembraneless compartments known as biomolecular condensates are thought to form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). When forces are applied to the fluid interfaces of these condensates, surface fluctuation are generated, a phenomenon known as capillary waves. The spatiotemporal dynamics of these fluctuations, characterized by the amplitude and velocity, reflect the physical properties of condensates. Moreover, unraveling the nature of fluctuations near the critical point is crucial for understanding the universal physical underpinnings of phase transitions. Although fluid condensate interfaces are ubiquitous within living cells, little is known about their surface fluctuations. Here, we quantify the interface fluctuations of light-induced synthetic and endogenous nuclear condensates, including nucleoli and nuclear speckles, in real and Fourier space. Measured fluctuations align with a theory assuming thermal driving, which enables measurement of surface tension and effective viscosity. The surface tensions fall within the range of 10-6 to 10-5 N/m for all tested condensates; in contrast, we find significant difference of fluctuation velocities, highlighting much higher viscosity of nucleoli 104 [~]Pa {middle dot}s, compared to synthetic condensates and nuclear speckles. We further find that the interface fluctuations become enhanced and slower as the system nears the critical point. These findings elucidate key aspects of intracellular condensate properties, and suggest that the critical trend of surface tension is more consistent with theoretical predictions by the mean-field model than those by the 3D Ising model.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Resolving conformational heterogeneity in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) datasets remains a significant challenge in structural biology. Previous methods have often been restricted to working exclusively on volumetric densities, neglecting the potential of incorporating any pre-existing structural knowledge as prior or constraints. In this paper, we present a novel methodology, cryoSTAR, that harnesses atomic model information as structural regularization to elucidate such heterogeneity. Our method uniquely outputs both coarse-grained models and density maps, showcasing the molecular conformational changes at different levels. Validated against four diverse experimental datasets, spanning large complexes, a membrane protein, and a small single-chain protein, our results consistently demonstrate an efficient and effective solution to conformational heterogeneity with minimal human bias. By integrating atomic model insights with cryo-EM data, cryoSTAR represents a meaningful step forward, paving the way for a deeper understanding of dynamic biological processes.1</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life and play a variety of essential cellular roles. IDRs exist in a collection of structurally distinct conformers known as an ensemble. IDR amino acid sequence determines its ensemble, which in turn can play an important role in dictating molecular function. Yet a clear link connecting IDR sequence, its ensemble properties, and its molecular function in living cells has not been systematically established. Here, we set out to test this sequence-ensemble-function paradigm using a novel computational method (GOOSE) that enables the rational design of libraries of IDRs by systematically varying specific sequence properties. Using ensemble FRET, we measured the ensemble dimensions of a library of rationally designed IDRs in human-derived cell lines, revealing how IDR sequence influences ensemble dimensions in situ. Furthermore, we show that the interplay between sequence and ensemble can tune an IDRs ability to sense changes in cell volume - a de novo molecular function for these synthetic sequences. Our results establish biophysical rules for intracellular sequence-ensemble relationships, enable a new route for understanding how IDR sequences map to function in live cells, and set the ground for the design of synthetic IDRs with de novo function.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian Ca2&#43;-dependent Slo K&#43; channels are expressed with {beta} and {gamma} auxiliary subunits that greatly influence voltage- and Ca2&#43;-induced gating, thereby fundamentally altering the behavior of the channel. The four {gamma} subunits reduce the need for voltage-dependent activation, allowing Slo to open in the absence of an action potential. The mechanism of this activation has, however, remained elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of Slo1 in complex with {gamma}1/LRRC26, revealing how the transmembrane helix of {gamma}1 binds and presumably stabilizes the active conformation of the voltage-sensor domain. This effect is further enhanced by a polybasic stretch on the intracellular side of the membrane which locally changes the charge gradient across the membrane. Sequence differences explain why the four {gamma} subunits possess different activation efficiencies. Simultaneous binding of {gamma} and the unrelated {beta} subunits is structurally possible, as both binding sites do not overlap and the {gamma}1 LRR domains are partially flexible. Thus, our data provide a possible explanation for Slo1 regulation by {gamma} subunits, and furthermore suggest a novel mechanism of activation of voltage-gated ion channels by auxiliary subunits and add to the growing knowledge of their complex regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">MINFLUX has achieved record resolution in superresolution imaging and single fluorophore tracking. It is based on localizing single fluorophores by rapid probing with a patterned beam that features a local intensity minimum. Current implementations, however, are complex and expensive and are limited in speed and robustness.

Here, we show that a combination of an electro-optical modulator with a segmented birefringent element such as a spatial light modulator produces a variable phase plate for which the phase can be scanned on the MHz timescale. Bisected or top-hat phase patterns generate high-contrast compact excitation point-spread functions for MINFLUX localization in the x,y, and z-direction, respectively, which can be scanned around a fluorophore within a microsecond and alternated among different excitation wavelengths.

We discuss how to compensate for non-optimal performance of the components and present a robust 3D and multi-color MINFLUX excitation module with record speed, which we envision as an integral component of a high-performance and cost-effective open-source MINFLUX.</p>

        <p class="abstract">We introduce MINFLUX localization with interferometric illumination through opposing objective lenses for maximizing the attainable precision in 3D-localization of single inelastic scatterers, such as fluorophores. Our 4Pi optical configuration employs three sequentially tilted counter-propagating beam pairs for illumination, each providing a narrow interference minimum of illumination intensity at the focal point. The localization precision is additionally improved by adding the inelastically scattered (fluorescence) photons collected through both objective lenses. Our 4Pi configuration yields the currently highest precision per detected photon among all localization schemes. Tracking gold nanoparticles as non-blinking inelastic scatterers rendered a position uncertainty &lt; 0.4 nm3 in volume at a localization frequency of 2.9 kHz. We harnessed the record spatio-temporal precision of our 4Pi MINFLUX approach to examine the diffusion of single fluorophores and fluorescent nanobeads in solutions of sucrose in water, revealing local heterogeneities at the nanoscale. Our results show the applicability of 4Pi MINFLUX to study molecular nano-environments of diffusion and its potential for quantifying rapid movements of molecules in cells and other material composites.</p>

        <p class="abstract">There are more ways to synthesize a 100 amino acid protein (20100) than atoms in the universe. Only a miniscule fraction of such a vast sequence space can ever be experimentally or computationally surveyed. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to navigate high-dimensional sequence spaces. However, these models are extremely complicated and provide little insight into the fundamental genetic architecture of proteins. Here, by experimentally exploring sequence spaces &gt;1010, we show that the genetic architecture of at least some proteins is remarkably simple, allowing accurate genetic prediction in high-dimensional sequence spaces with fully interpretable biophysical models. These models capture the non-linear relationships between free energies and phenotypes but otherwise consist of additive free energy changes with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. These energetic couplings are sparse and caused by structural contacts and backbone propagations. Our results suggest that artificial intelligence models may be vastly more complicated than the proteins that they are modeling and that protein genetics is actually both simple and intelligible.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The FET family proteins, which includes FUS, EWS, and TAF15, are RNA chaperones instrumental in processes such as mRNA maturation, transcriptional regulation, and the DNA damage response. These proteins have clinical significance: chromosomal rearrangements in FET proteins are implicated in Ewing family tumors and related sarcomas. Furthermore, point mutations in FUS and TAF15 are associated with neurodegenerative conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar dementia. The fusion protein EWS::FLI1, the causative mutation of Ewing sarcoma, arises from a genomic translocation that fuses the low-complexity domain (LCD) of EWS (EWSLCD) with the DNA binding domain of the ETS transcription factor FLI1. This fusion not only alters transcriptional programs but also hinders native EWS functions like splicing. However, the precise function of the intrinsically disordered EWSLCD is still a topic of active investigation. Due to its flexible nature, EWSLCD can form transient interactions with itself and other biomolecules, leading to the formation of biomolecular condensates through phase separation - a mechanism thought to be central to the oncogenicity of EWS::FLI1.

In our study, we used paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, light microscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to better understand the self-association and phase separation tendencies of EWSLCD. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular events that underpin EWSLCD-mediated biomolecular condensation. Our NMR data suggest tyrosine residues primarily drive the interactions vital for EWSLCD phase separation. Moreover, a higher density and proximity of tyrosine residues amplify the likelihood of condensate formation. Atomistic MD simulations and hydrodynamic experiments revealed that the tyrosine-rich N and C-termini tend to populate compact conformations, establishing unique contact networks, that are connected by a predominantly extended, tyrosine-depleted, linker region. MD simulations provide critical input on the relationship between contacts formed within a single molecule (intramolecular) and inside the condensed phase (intermolecular), and changes in protein conformations upon condensation. These results offer deeper insights into the condensate-forming abilities of the FET proteins and highlights unique structural and functional nuances between EWS and its counterparts, FUS and TAF15.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In microbial communities, various cell types often coexist by occupying distinct spatial domains. What determines the shape of the interface between such domains--which in turn influences the interactions between cells and overall community function? Here, we address this question by developing a continuum model of a 2D spatially-structured microbial community with two distinct cell types. We find that, depending on the balance of the different cell proliferation rates and substrate friction coefficients, the interface between domains is either stable and smooth, or unstable and develops finger-like protrusions. We establish quantitative principles describing when these different interfacial behaviors arise, and find good agreement both with the results of previous experimental reports as well as new experiments performed here. Our work thus helps to provide a biophysical basis for understanding the interfacial morphodynamics of proliferating microbial communities, as well as a broader range of proliferating active systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eukaryotic cells show an astounding ability to migrate through pores and constrictions smaller than their nuclear diameter. However, the forces engaged in nuclear deformation and their effect on confined cell dynamics remain unclear. Here, we study the mechanics and dynamics of nuclei of mesenchymal cancer cells as they spontaneously and repeatedly transition through 3D compliant hydrogel channels. We find a biphasic dependence of migration speed and transition frequency on channel width, revealing maximal transition rates at widths comparable to the nuclear diameter. Using confocal imaging and hydrogel bead displacement, we determine the nuclear deformation and corresponding forces during spontaneous confined migration. We find the nucleus to reversibly deform with an elastic modulus not adapting to the confinement. Instead, with decreasing channel width, the nuclear shape during transmigration changes biphasically concomitant with the transitioning dynamics. The nucleus exhibits a prolate form along the migration direction in wide channels and a more compressed oblate shape in narrow channels. We propose a physical model for confined cell migration that explains the observed nuclear shapes and slowing down in terms of the cytoskeletal force-generation adapting from a pulling-to a pushing-dominated mechanism with increasing nuclear confinement.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membraneless compartments known as biomolecular condensates are thought to form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). When forces are applied to the fluid interfaces of these condensates, surface fluctuation are generated, a phenomenon known as capillary waves. The spatiotemporal dynamics of these fluctuations, characterized by the amplitude and velocity, reflect the physical properties of condensates. Moreover, unraveling the nature of fluctuations near the critical point is crucial for understanding the universal physical underpinnings of phase transitions. Although fluid condensate interfaces are ubiquitous within living cells, little is known about their surface fluctuations. Here, we quantify the interface fluctuations of light-induced synthetic and endogenous nuclear condensates, including nucleoli and nuclear speckles, in real and Fourier space. Measured fluctuations align with a theory assuming thermal driving, which enables measurement of surface tension and effective viscosity. The surface tensions fall within the range of 10-6 to 10-5 N/m for all tested condensates; in contrast, we find significant difference of fluctuation velocities, highlighting much higher viscosity of nucleoli 104 [~]Pa {middle dot}s, compared to synthetic condensates and nuclear speckles. We further find that the interface fluctuations become enhanced and slower as the system nears the critical point. These findings elucidate key aspects of intracellular condensate properties, and suggest that the critical trend of surface tension is more consistent with theoretical predictions by the mean-field model than those by the 3D Ising model.</p>
