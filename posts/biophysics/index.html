W.; Zhu, X.; Han, L.; Li, E.; Nair, A.; Lee, C. L.; Ke, H.; Zhang, G.; Doud, E. H.; Ho, C.-M.\nScore: 96.7, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.03.556115\nMalaria parasites rely heavily on rapid, high fidelity protein synthesis to infect and replicate in human erythrocytes, making translation an attractive target for new antimalarials. Here, we have determined in situ structures of Pf80S ribosomes in thirteen conformational and compositional states from cryoFIB-milled Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes across the stages of asexual intraerythrocytic parasite replication. We observe eight active translation intermediates, enabling us to define the native malarial translation elongation cycle, which surprisingly features a bifurcation at the decoding stage of the cycle that has not previously been described. Examination of perturbations in the distribution of ribosomes among these states in the presence of a malaria-specific translation inhibitor suggest that the inhibitor impedes PfeEF2 and PfeEF1 interactions with the ribosome. We integrated our in situ cryoET data with proteomic and ultrastructural data to arrive at a deeper understanding of malarial translation, which will inform development of new therapies.\nConserved nucleocytoplasmic density homeostasis drives cellular organization across eukaryotes\nAuthors: Biswas, A.; Munoz, O.; Kim, K.; Hoege, C.; Lorton, B. M.; Shechter, D.; Guck, J.; Zaburdaev, V.; Reber, S.\nScore: 71.8, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556409\nThe packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.\nqMaLioffG: A single green fluorescent protein FLIM indicator enabling quantitative imaging of endogenous ATP\nAuthors: Arai, S.; Itoh, H.; Vu, C. Q.; Nakayama, M.; Oshima, M.; Morita, A.; Okamoto, K.; Okuda, S.; Teranishi, A.; Osawa, M.; Tamura, Y.; Nonoyama, S.; Takuma, M.; Fujie, T.; Sarker, S. R.; Sudhaharan, T.; Kiya, T.; Lane, E. B.; Kitaguchi, T.\nScore: 44.1, Published: 2023-08-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.29.555275\nThe widespread use of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for quantitative imaging is hindered by the limited availability of a FLIM-based genetically encoded indicator using a conventional 488 nm laser. Here, we present qMaLioffG, a single green fluorescent protein FLIM indicator showing a fluorescence lifetime change in ATP concentration within the physiological range. This allows quantitative imaging of endogenous ATP to investigate cellular energy status of different cell types.\nVarying the position of phospholipid acyl chain unsaturation modulates hopanoid and sterol ordering\nAuthors: Nguyen, A. H. N.; Sharp, L.; Lyman, E.; Saenz, J. P.\nScore: 20.0, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.06.556521\nThe cell membrane acts as a responsive interface between the cell and its surroundings. Ultimately, the diverse panel of lipids comprising the lipidome are employed to tune membrane biophysical properties for optimal function. For eukaryotes, a family of amphiphiles called sterols are crucial due to their unique capacity to modulate the order of membrane lipids. Bacteria typically lack sterols, however, some can synthesize a family of sterol-analogues called hopanoids. Hopanoids are recognized as bacterial analogs of sterols due to their chemical and biophysical similarities. Notably, hopanoids are proposed as evolutionary sterol precursors since they have been found in ancient sediments and their biosynthesis could have proceeded prior to the oxygenation of Earths surface. While hopanoids and sterols can both impart order to saturated phospholipids, this interaction changes vastly with the presence of a double bond in the phospholipids acyl chain. Here, we present a study examining how the unsaturation position along the acyl chain influences the ordering effect of sterols (cholesterol) and hopanoids (diplopterol). We found that diplopterol and cholesterol exhibit different ordering effects on unsaturated lipids, depending on the relative positions of the double bond and the methyl groups of cholesterol/diplopterol. Moreover, in the bacterium Mesoplasma florum, diplopterol's interplay with unsaturated lipid isomers modulates bacterial membrane robustness. These results reveal how subtle changes in lipid structure can influence the membrane's collective properties and introduces double bond position as a modifiable lipidomic feature that cells can employ to fine-tune their membrane for adaptation to environmental change.\nLongitudinal Awake Imaging of Deep Mouse Brain Microvasculature with Super-resolution Ultrasound Localization Microscopy\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Lowerison, M. R.; You, Q.; Lin, B.-Z.; Llano, D. A.; Song, P.\nScore: 18.5, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.01.555789\nSuper-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves capillary-scale microvasculature in deep tissues. However, existing preclinical ULM applications are largely constrained to anesthetized animals, introducing confounding vascular effects such as vasodilation and altered hemodynamics. As such, ULM quantifications (e.g., vessel diameter, density, and flow velocity) may be confounded by the use of anesthesia, undermining the usefulness of ULM in practice. Here we introduce a method to address this limitation and achieve ULM imaging in awake mouse brain. Pupillary monitoring was used to confirm the awake state during ULM imaging. ULM revealed that veins showed a greater degree of vascularity reduction from anesthesia to awake states than did arteries. The reduction was most significant in the midbrain and least significant in the cortex. ULM also revealed a significant reduction in venous blood flow velocity across different brain regions under awake conditions. Serial in vivo imaging of the same animal brain at weekly intervals demonstrated the highly robust longitudinal imaging capability of the proposed technique. This is the first study demonstrating longitudinal ULM imaging in the awake mouse brain, which is essential for many ULM brain applications that require awake and behaving animals.\nCFM: Confinement Force Microscopy-a dynamic, precise and stable microconfiner for traction force microscopy in spatial confinement\nAuthors: Betz, T.; Abbasi, F.; Rieck, K.; Brandt, M.; Matis, M.\nScore: 17.5, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.22.554088\nIn vivo, cells experience complex tissue environments with various chemical and physical features. They sense and respond to tissue morphology and mechanical properties and adjust their behavior and function based on the surrounding. In contrast to the free environment experienced on 2D substrates commonly used in research, the 3D natural environment represents a major physical obstacle for cells. Here, cells are usually confined either by the extracellular matrix (ECM) or neighboring cells. The importance of such confinements has been demon-strated in the past decades by showing its influence on cell decision-making in many vital biological processes such as migration, division and cytoskeletal reorganization. Despite these insights, the sheer level of complexity faced when studying cell biological questions in biomimetic confined situations, led to an indispensable need for a 3D system which can simulate the in vivo confined condition, while being capable of providing microenvironments with different chemical and physical properties for the cells and capturing the mechanical forces and properties of the studied biological sample. Here we introduce a microconfiner that finally provides a new imaging capacity, namely the confine-ment force microscopy (CFM). We are able to adjust the confinement level in real time during microscopy while measuring not only the the cellular traction but also the cellular compression forces. Furthermore, the chemical and physical properties of the microenvironment can be optimized for the respective questions. We demonstrate the power of this confinement system by the mechanical response of cells, migration analysis of immune cells, the timed force generation during durotaxis driven adhesion switching and the viscoelastic properties of cancer tissue.\nDeep reconstructing generative networks for visualizing dynamic biomolecules inside cells\nAuthors: Rangan, R.; Khavnekar, S.; Lerer, A.; Johnston, J.; Kelley, R.; Obr, M.; Kotecha, A.; Zhong, E. D.\nScore: 149.4, Published: 2023-08-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.553799\nAdvances in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have produced new opportunities to visualize the structures of dynamic macromolecular machinery in native cellular environments. Here, we describe a machine learning approach that can reconstruct the structural landscape and dynamics of biomolecular complexes present in cryo-ET subtomograms. This method, cryoDRGN-ET, learns a deep generative model of 3D density maps directly from subtomogram tilt series images and can capture states diverse in both composition and conformation. We use this approach to reconstruct the in situ translation dynamics of prokaryotic ribosomes, and we reveal the distribution of functional states during translation elongation populated by S. cerevisiae ribosomes inside cells.\nDisruption of Ordered Membrane Domains as a Mechanism Underlying Neuropathic Pain\nAuthors: Handlin, L. J.; Macchi, N. L.; Dumaire, N.; Salih, L.; McCommis, K. S.; Moutal, A.; Dai, G.\nScore: 7.4, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.02.556056\nCell membranes consist of heterogeneous lipid domains that influence key cellular processes, including signal transduction, endocytosis, and electrical excitability. The goal of this study was to assess the size of cholesterol-enriched ordered membrane domains (OMD) in various cell types. Multiple cell types were tested using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whereby small nociceptor DRG neurons and cardiac pacemaker cells displayed the highest FRET intensities. This implies that electrically active cells tend to have large OMDs. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol-extracting reagent {beta}-cyclodextrin ({beta}-CD) led to a decrease in FRET, indicating a reduction in the OMD size, whereas detergents known to promote domain coalescence in artificial membranes increased OMD size. In an in vitro fatty liver model, palmitate supplementation increased FRET whereas oleate supplementation decreased FRET in isolated primary murine hepatocytes, highlighting the importance of unsaturated lipid tails in lipid domain organization. Disruption of OMD using {beta}-CD potentiated action potential firing in nociceptor DRG neurons and decreased the free energy needed for opening native hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. After disrupting the OMD, HCN channels exhibited an increased relative open probability at the resting membrane potential (RMP). A significant reduction in FRET was observed in both a chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain model and a spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, consistent with disrupted or shrunken OMD in these models. Collectively, these findings show that disturbances in lipid domains may contribute to the progression of neuropathic pain, and they suggest new therapeutic strategies to achieve pain relief.\nElasticity of adhesion bonds determines multistable mechanosensitive behaviour of living cells.\nAuthors: Liu, P.; Wang, Q.; Yao, M.; Efremov, A. K.\nScore: 6.3, Published: 2023-09-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.04.554585\nThe ability of cells to sense the mechanical properties of their microenvironment is essential to many physiological processes. Previously, the molecular clutch theory was developed to explain many mechanosensitive cell behaviours. However, because it does not take into account the nonlinear elastic properties of key proteins involved in the formation of cell adhesion complexes, this theory cannot establish a relationship between mechanosensitive cell adhesion behaviour and the force response of underlying proteins observed in single-molecule experiments. In this study, we developed a model incorporating the experimentally measured nonlinear elastic properties of such proteins to investigate their influence on cell adhesion behaviour. It was found that the model not only could accurately fit previous experimental measurements of the cell traction force and the retrograde actin flow, but also predicted multistable cell adhesion behaviour along with a feedback loop between the densities of the extracellular matrix proteins and myosin II motors in living cells. Existence of the latter was successfully confirmed in experiments on NIH-3T3 cells. Taken together, our study provides a theoretical framework for understanding how the mechanical properties of adapter proteins, local substrate deformations and myosin II contractility affect cell adhesion behaviour across different cell types and physiological conditions.\nThermodynamic Forces from Protein and Water Govern Condensate Formation of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Domain\nAuthors: Mukherjee, S.; Schafer, L. V.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2023-09-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.05.556343\nLiquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) can drive a multitude of cellular processes by compartmentalizing biological cells via the formation of dense liquid biomolecular condensates, which can function as membraneless organelles. Despite its importance, the molecular-level understanding of the underlying thermodynamics of this process remains incomplete. In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the low complexity domain (LCD) of human fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein to investigate the contributions of water and protein molecules to the free energy changes that govern LLPS. Both protein and water components are found to have comparably sizeable thermodynamic contributions to the formation of FUS condensates. Moreover, we quantify the counteracting effects of water molecules that are released into the bulk upon condensate formation and the waters retained within the protein droplets. Among the various factors considered, solvation entropy and protein interaction enthalpy are identified as the most important contributions, while solvation enthalpy and protein entropy changes are smaller. These insights provide detailed molecular insights on the intricate thermodynamic interplay between protein- and solvation-related forces underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Malaria parasites rely heavily on rapid, high fidelity protein synthesis to infect and replicate in human erythrocytes, making translation an attractive target for new antimalarials. Here, we have determined in situ structures of Pf80S ribosomes in thirteen conformational and compositional states from cryoFIB-milled Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes across the stages of asexual intraerythrocytic parasite replication. We observe eight active translation intermediates, enabling us to define the native malarial translation elongation cycle, which surprisingly features a bifurcation at the decoding stage of the cycle that has not previously been described. Examination of perturbations in the distribution of ribosomes among these states in the presence of a malaria-specific translation inhibitor suggest that the inhibitor impedes PfeEF2 and PfeEF1 interactions with the ribosome. We integrated our in situ cryoET data with proteomic and ultrastructural data to arrive at a deeper understanding of malarial translation, which will inform development of new therapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The packing and confinement of macromolecules in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm has profound implications for cellular biochemistry. How intracellular density distributions vary and affect cellular physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus is less dense than the cytoplasm and that living systems establish and maintain a constant density ratio between these compartments. Using label-free biophotonics and theory, we show that nuclear density is set by a pressure balance across the nuclear envelope in vitro, in vivo and during early development. Nuclear transport establishes a specific nuclear proteome that exerts a colloid osmotic pressure, which, assisted by entropic chromatin pressure, draws water into the nucleus. Using C. elegans, we show that while nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) volume ratios change during early development, the N/C density ratio is robustly maintained. We propose that the maintenance of a constant N/C density ratio is the biophysical driver of one of the oldest tenets of cell biology: the N/C volume ratio. In summary, this study reveals a previously unidentified homeostatic coupling of macromolecular densities that drives cellular organization with implications for pathophysiologies such as senescence and cancer.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The cell membrane acts as a responsive interface between the cell and its surroundings. Ultimately, the diverse panel of lipids comprising the lipidome are employed to tune membrane biophysical properties for optimal function. For eukaryotes, a family of amphiphiles called sterols are crucial due to their unique capacity to modulate the order of membrane lipids. Bacteria typically lack sterols, however, some can synthesize a family of sterol-analogues called hopanoids. Hopanoids are recognized as bacterial analogs of sterols due to their chemical and biophysical similarities. Notably, hopanoids are proposed as evolutionary sterol precursors since they have been found in ancient sediments and their biosynthesis could have proceeded prior to the oxygenation of Earths surface. While hopanoids and sterols can both impart order to saturated phospholipids, this interaction changes vastly with the presence of a double bond in the phospholipids acyl chain. Here, we present a study examining how the unsaturation position along the acyl chain influences the ordering effect of sterols (cholesterol) and hopanoids (diplopterol). We found that diplopterol and cholesterol exhibit different ordering effects on unsaturated lipids, depending on the relative positions of the double bond and the methyl groups of cholesterol/diplopterol. Moreover, in the bacterium Mesoplasma florum, diplopterol&#39;s interplay with unsaturated lipid isomers modulates bacterial membrane robustness. These results reveal how subtle changes in lipid structure can influence the membrane&#39;s collective properties and introduces double bond position as a modifiable lipidomic feature that cells can employ to fine-tune their membrane for adaptation to environmental change.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Super-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging imaging modality that resolves capillary-scale microvasculature in deep tissues. However, existing preclinical ULM applications are largely constrained to anesthetized animals, introducing confounding vascular effects such as vasodilation and altered hemodynamics. As such, ULM quantifications (e.g., vessel diameter, density, and flow velocity) may be confounded by the use of anesthesia, undermining the usefulness of ULM in practice. Here we introduce a method to address this limitation and achieve ULM imaging in awake mouse brain. Pupillary monitoring was used to confirm the awake state during ULM imaging. ULM revealed that veins showed a greater degree of vascularity reduction from anesthesia to awake states than did arteries. The reduction was most significant in the midbrain and least significant in the cortex. ULM also revealed a significant reduction in venous blood flow velocity across different brain regions under awake conditions. Serial in vivo imaging of the same animal brain at weekly intervals demonstrated the highly robust longitudinal imaging capability of the proposed technique. This is the first study demonstrating longitudinal ULM imaging in the awake mouse brain, which is essential for many ULM brain applications that require awake and behaving animals.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In vivo, cells experience complex tissue environments with various chemical and physical features. They sense and respond to tissue morphology and mechanical properties and adjust their behavior and function based on the surrounding. In contrast to the free environment experienced on 2D substrates commonly used in research, the 3D natural environment represents a major physical obstacle for cells. Here, cells are usually confined either by the extracellular matrix (ECM) or neighboring cells. The importance of such confinements has been demon-strated in the past decades by showing its influence on cell decision-making in many vital biological processes such as migration, division and cytoskeletal reorganization. Despite these insights, the sheer level of complexity faced when studying cell biological questions in biomimetic confined situations, led to an indispensable need for a 3D system which can simulate the in vivo confined condition, while being capable of providing microenvironments with different chemical and physical properties for the cells and capturing the mechanical forces and properties of the studied biological sample. Here we introduce a microconfiner that finally provides a new imaging capacity, namely the confine-ment force microscopy (CFM). We are able to adjust the confinement level in real time during microscopy while measuring not only the the cellular traction but also the cellular compression forces. Furthermore, the chemical and physical properties of the microenvironment can be optimized for the respective questions. We demonstrate the power of this confinement system by the mechanical response of cells, migration analysis of immune cells, the timed force generation during durotaxis driven adhesion switching and the viscoelastic properties of cancer tissue.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Advances in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have produced new opportunities to visualize the structures of dynamic macromolecular machinery in native cellular environments. Here, we describe a machine learning approach that can reconstruct the structural landscape and dynamics of biomolecular complexes present in cryo-ET subtomograms. This method, cryoDRGN-ET, learns a deep generative model of 3D density maps directly from subtomogram tilt series images and can capture states diverse in both composition and conformation. We use this approach to reconstruct the in situ translation dynamics of prokaryotic ribosomes, and we reveal the distribution of functional states during translation elongation populated by S. cerevisiae ribosomes inside cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cell membranes consist of heterogeneous lipid domains that influence key cellular processes, including signal transduction, endocytosis, and electrical excitability. The goal of this study was to assess the size of cholesterol-enriched ordered membrane domains (OMD) in various cell types. Multiple cell types were tested using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET), whereby small nociceptor DRG neurons and cardiac pacemaker cells displayed the highest FRET intensities. This implies that electrically active cells tend to have large OMDs. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol-extracting reagent {beta}-cyclodextrin ({beta}-CD) led to a decrease in FRET, indicating a reduction in the OMD size, whereas detergents known to promote domain coalescence in artificial membranes increased OMD size. In an in vitro fatty liver model, palmitate supplementation increased FRET whereas oleate supplementation decreased FRET in isolated primary murine hepatocytes, highlighting the importance of unsaturated lipid tails in lipid domain organization. Disruption of OMD using {beta}-CD potentiated action potential firing in nociceptor DRG neurons and decreased the free energy needed for opening native hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. After disrupting the OMD, HCN channels exhibited an increased relative open probability at the resting membrane potential (RMP). A significant reduction in FRET was observed in both a chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain model and a spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, consistent with disrupted or shrunken OMD in these models. Collectively, these findings show that disturbances in lipid domains may contribute to the progression of neuropathic pain, and they suggest new therapeutic strategies to achieve pain relief.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The ability of cells to sense the mechanical properties of their microenvironment is essential to many physiological processes. Previously, the molecular clutch theory was developed to explain many mechanosensitive cell behaviours. However, because it does not take into account the nonlinear elastic properties of key proteins involved in the formation of cell adhesion complexes, this theory cannot establish a relationship between mechanosensitive cell adhesion behaviour and the force response of underlying proteins observed in single-molecule experiments. In this study, we developed a model incorporating the experimentally measured nonlinear elastic properties of such proteins to investigate their influence on cell adhesion behaviour. It was found that the model not only could accurately fit previous experimental measurements of the cell traction force and the retrograde actin flow, but also predicted multistable cell adhesion behaviour along with a feedback loop between the densities of the extracellular matrix proteins and myosin II motors in living cells. Existence of the latter was successfully confirmed in experiments on NIH-3T3 cells. Taken together, our study provides a theoretical framework for understanding how the mechanical properties of adapter proteins, local substrate deformations and myosin II contractility affect cell adhesion behaviour across different cell types and physiological conditions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) can drive a multitude of cellular processes by compartmentalizing biological cells via the formation of dense liquid biomolecular condensates, which can function as membraneless organelles. Despite its importance, the molecular-level understanding of the underlying thermodynamics of this process remains incomplete. In this study, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the low complexity domain (LCD) of human fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein to investigate the contributions of water and protein molecules to the free energy changes that govern LLPS. Both protein and water components are found to have comparably sizeable thermodynamic contributions to the formation of FUS condensates. Moreover, we quantify the counteracting effects of water molecules that are released into the bulk upon condensate formation and the waters retained within the protein droplets. Among the various factors considered, solvation entropy and protein interaction enthalpy are identified as the most important contributions, while solvation enthalpy and protein entropy changes are smaller. These insights provide detailed molecular insights on the intricate thermodynamic interplay between protein- and solvation-related forces underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates.</p>
