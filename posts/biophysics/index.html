R.; Levental, I.\nScore: 112.7, Published: 2023-07-31 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.30.551157\nMembranes are molecular interfaces that insulate cells from external stresses, compartmentalize the cytoplasm, and control the flow of nutrients and information1. These functions are facilitated by diverse collections of lipids, nearly all of which are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of living bilayers2,3. Previous models of biomembrane structure and function have rested upon the implicit assumption that the two membrane leaflets have similar abundances of phospholipids. Here, we show that this assumption is generally invalid and investigate the consequences of lipid abundance imbalances in mammalian plasma membranes (PM). Using quantitative lipidomics, we discovered that cytoplasmic leaflets of human erythrocyte PMs have \u003e50% overabundance of phospholipids compared to exoplasmic leaflets. We show that this phospholipid imbalance is enabled by an asymmetric interleaflet distribution of cholesterol4,5, which rapidly redistributes to buffer leaflet stresses. Asymmetric phospholipid abundance and composition combine to enrich cholesterol in the exoplasmic PM leaflet. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches we demonstrate how these lipid distributions impart unique functional characteristics to PMs, including low permeability, surprisingly fast cholesterol diffusion6, and resting tension in the cytoplasmic monolayer that regulates protein localization. Our observations of these previously overlooked aspects of membrane asymmetry represent an evolution of classic paradigms1,7 of biomembrane structure and physiology.\nThinner is not always better: Optimising cryo lamellae for subtomogram averaging\nAuthors: Tuijtel, M. W.; Kreysing, J. P.; Welsch, S.; Hummer, G.; Beck, M.; Turonova, B.\nScore: 23.4, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.31.551274\nCryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to elucidate subcellular architecture and to structurally analyse biomolecules in situ by subtomogram averaging (STA). Specimen thickness is a key factor affecting cryo-ET data quality. Cells that are too thick for transmission imaging can be thinned by cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling. However, optimal specimen thickness for cryo-ET on lamellae has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, the ions used to ablate material can cause damage in the lamellae, thereby reducing STA resolution. Here, we systematically benchmark the resolution depending on lamella thickness and the depth of the particles within the sample. Up to ca. 180 nm, lamella thickness does not negatively impact resolution. This shows that there is no need to generate very thin lamellae and thickness can be chosen such that it captures major cellular features. Furthermore, we show that gallium-ion-induced damage extends to depths of up to 30 nm from either lamella surface.\nGraph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP): Identifying Druggable Binding Sites Using Graph Neural Networks with Attention\nAuthors: Smith, Z.; Strobel, M.; Vani, B.; Tiwary, P.\nScore: 40.8, Published: 2023-07-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.25.550565\nIdentifying and discovering druggable protein binding sites is an important early step in computer-aided drug discovery but remains a difficult task where most campaigns rely on a priori knowledge of binding sites from experiments. Here we present a novel binding site prediction method called Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) and re-evaluate assumptions in nearly every step in the site prediction workflow from dataset preparation to model evaluation. GrASP is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance at recovering binding sites in PDB structures while maintaining a high degree of precision which will minimize wasted computation in downstream tasks such as docking and free energy perturbation.\nConstitutive activity of ionotropic glutamate receptors via a hydrophobic plug in the ligand-binding domain\nAuthors: Seljeset, S.; Sintsova, O.; Wang, Y.; Harb, H. Y.; Lynagh, T.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-08-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551817\nNeurotransmitter ligands electrically excite neurons by activating ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) ion channels. Knowledge of the iGluR amino acid residues that dominate ligand-induced activation would enable the prediction of function from sequence. We therefore explored determinants of activity in rat NMDA-type iGluRs (NMDA receptors), complex heteromeric iGluRs comprising two glycine-binding GluN1 and two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits, using amino acid sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology. We find that a broadly conserved aspartate residue controls both ligand potency and channel activity, to the extent that certain substitutions at this position bypass the need for ligand-binding in GluN1 subunits, generating NMDA receptors activated solely by glutamate. Furthermore, we identify a homomeric iGluR from the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens that has utilized this crucial residue to evolve into a leak channel that is inhibited by neurotransmitter binding, pointing to a dominant role of this residue throughout the iGluR superfamily.\nApproximating conformational Boltzmann distributions with AlphaFold2 predictions\nAuthors: Brown, B. P.; Stein, R. A.; Meiler, J.; Mchaourab, H.\nScore: 12.9, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552168\nProtein dynamics are intimately tied to biological function and can enable processes such as signal transduction, enzyme catalysis, and molecular recognition. The relative free energies of conformations that contribute to these functional equilibria are evolved for the physiology of the organism. Despite the importance of these equilibria for understanding biological function and developing treatments for disease, the computational and experimental methods capable of quantifying them are limited to systems of modest size. Here, we demonstrate that AlphaFold2 contact distance distributions can approximate conformational Boltzmann distributions, which we evaluate through examination of the joint probability distributions of inter-residue contact distances along functionally relevant collective variables of several protein systems. Further, we show that contact distance probability distributions generated by AlphaFold2 are sensitive to points mutations thus AF2 can predict the structural effects of mutations in some systems. We anticipate that our approach will be a valuable tool to model the thermodynamics of conformational changes in large biomolecular systems.\nConserved molecular recognition by an intrinsically disordered region in the absence of sequence conservation\nAuthors: Alston, J.; Soranno, A.; Holehouse, A. S.\nScore: 11.5, Published: 2023-08-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.06.552128\nIntrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are critical for cellular function, yet often appear to lack sequence conservation when assessed by multiple sequence alignments. This raises the question of if and how function can be encoded and preserved in these regions despite massive sequence variation. To address this question, we have applied coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate non-specific RNA binding of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins consist of multiple interspersed disordered and folded domains that bind RNA. We focussed here on the first two domains of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, the disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) followed by the folded RNA binding domain (RBD). While the NTD is highly variable across evolution, the RBD is structurally conserved. This combination makes the NTD-RBD a convenient model system to explore the interplay between an IDR adjacent to a folded domain, and how changes in IDR sequence can influence molecular recognition of a partner. Our results reveal a surprising degree of sequence-specificity encoded by both the composition and the precise order of the amino acids in the NTD. The presence of an NTD can - depending on the sequence - either suppress or enhance RNA binding. Despite this sensitivity, large-scale variation in NTD sequences is possible while certain sequence features are retained. Consequently, a conformationally-conserved fuzzy RNA:protein complex is found across nucleocapsid protein orthologs, despite large-scale changes in both NTD sequence and RBD surface chemistry. Taken together, these insights shed light on the ability of disordered regions to preserve functional characteristics despite their sequence variability.\nInvariant point message passing for protein side chain packing and design\nAuthors: Randolph, N. Z.; Kuhlman, B.\nScore: 9.6, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551328\nProtein side chain packing (PSCP) is a fundamental problem in the field of protein engineering, as high confidence and low energy conformations of amino acid side chains are crucial for understanding (and designing) protein folding, protein-protein interactions, and protein-ligand interactions. Traditional PSCP methods (such as the Rosetta Packer) often rely on a library of discrete side chain conformations, or rotamers, and a forcefield to guide the structure to low energy conformations. Recently, deep learning (DL) based methods (such as DLPacker, AttnPacker, and DiffPack) have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictions and speed in the PSCP task. Building off the success of graph and message passing neural networks for protein modeling, we present the Protein Invariant Point Packer (PIPPack) which effectively processes local structural and sequence information to produce realistic, idealized side chain coordinates using -angle distribution predictions and geometry-aware invariant point message passing (IPMP). To demonstrate its broad applicability to protein-related tasks, IPMP was additionally incorporated in a fixed backbone protein design method, which enabled the generation of more native-like sequences than common message passing schemes. On a test set of [~]1,400 high-quality protein chains, PIPPack performs competitively with other state-of-the-art PSCP methods in rotamer recovery and per-residue RMSDs but is significantly faster.\nDynamic instability of force-generating bacterial microtubules\nAuthors: Amini Hounejani, R.; Volkov, V. A.; Dogterom, M.\nScore: 8.9, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551647\nDynamic instability refers to the ability of cytoskeletal polymers to switch between growing and shrinking phases. This phenomenon has been extensively studied for eukaryotic microtubules which consist of 13 protofilaments. Here we report on the dynamic properties of prokaryotic microtubules found in Prosthecobacter bacteria, which consist of 4-5 protofilaments and, like their eukaryotic counterparts, display dynamic instability. Using microfabricated barriers we show that the catastrophe rate of bacterial microtubules increases when their growth is stalled by a rigid barrier. We find that the lifetime distributions of both free and stalled bacterial microtubules can be fitted using the same phenomenological model that we previously introduced for eukaryotic microtubules, suggesting that bacterial microtubules may be considered a model system for eukaryotic microtubules. We further use cryo-electron tomography to reveal structural details of dynamic ends and show that bacterial microtubules may form doublets similar to axonemal microtubules in eukaryotes.\nTheory of sarcomere assembly inferred from sequential ordering of myofibril components\nAuthors: Kolley, F.; Sidor, C.; Dehapiot, B.; Schnorrer, F.; Friedrich, B. M.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551279\nMyofibrils in striated muscle cells are chains of regular cytoskeletal units termed sarcomeres, whose contractions drive voluntary movements of animals. Despite the well characterized order of the sarcomere components in mature sarcomeres, which explains the sarcomere contraction mechanism, the mechanism of molecular ordering during sarcomere assembly remains debated. Here, we put forward a theoretical framework for the self-assembly of sarcomeres. This theory is based on measurements of the sequential ordering of sarcomere components in developing Drosophila flight muscles, identified by applying a novel tracking-free algorithm: myosin, -actinin and the titin homologue Sallimus form periodic patterns before actin. Based on these results, we propose that myosin, Sallimus, and sarcomere Z-disc proteins including -actinin dynamically bind and unbind to an unordered bundle of actin filaments to establish an initial periodic pattern. As a consequence, periodicity of actin filaments is only established later. Our model proposes that non-local interactions between spatially extended myosin and titin/Sallimus containing complexes, and possibly tension-dependent feedback mediated by an -actinin catch-bond, drive this ordering process. We probe this hypothesis using mathematical models and derive predictive conditions for sarcomere pattern formation, guiding future experimental analysis.\nReliable protein-protein docking with AlphaFold, Rosetta and replica-exchange\nAuthors: Harmalkar, A.; Lyskov, S.; Gray, J. J.\nScore: 71.3, Published: 2023-07-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.28.551063\nDespite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners. Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases. 1 In this work, we combine AlphaFold as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol 2 to complete a robust in-silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 66% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (19% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 51%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep-learning based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling. The pipeline is available at github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Membranes are molecular interfaces that insulate cells from external stresses, compartmentalize the cytoplasm, and control the flow of nutrients and information1. These functions are facilitated by diverse collections of lipids, nearly all of which are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of living bilayers2,3. Previous models of biomembrane structure and function have rested upon the implicit assumption that the two membrane leaflets have similar abundances of phospholipids. Here, we show that this assumption is generally invalid and investigate the consequences of lipid abundance imbalances in mammalian plasma membranes (PM). Using quantitative lipidomics, we discovered that cytoplasmic leaflets of human erythrocyte PMs have &gt;50% overabundance of phospholipids compared to exoplasmic leaflets. We show that this phospholipid imbalance is enabled by an asymmetric interleaflet distribution of cholesterol4,5, which rapidly redistributes to buffer leaflet stresses. Asymmetric phospholipid abundance and composition combine to enrich cholesterol in the exoplasmic PM leaflet. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches we demonstrate how these lipid distributions impart unique functional characteristics to PMs, including low permeability, surprisingly fast cholesterol diffusion6, and resting tension in the cytoplasmic monolayer that regulates protein localization. Our observations of these previously overlooked aspects of membrane asymmetry represent an evolution of classic paradigms1,7 of biomembrane structure and physiology.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful method to elucidate subcellular architecture and to structurally analyse biomolecules in situ by subtomogram averaging (STA). Specimen thickness is a key factor affecting cryo-ET data quality. Cells that are too thick for transmission imaging can be thinned by cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling. However, optimal specimen thickness for cryo-ET on lamellae has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, the ions used to ablate material can cause damage in the lamellae, thereby reducing STA resolution. Here, we systematically benchmark the resolution depending on lamella thickness and the depth of the particles within the sample. Up to ca. 180 nm, lamella thickness does not negatively impact resolution. This shows that there is no need to generate very thin lamellae and thickness can be chosen such that it captures major cellular features. Furthermore, we show that gallium-ion-induced damage extends to depths of up to 30 nm from either lamella surface.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Identifying and discovering druggable protein binding sites is an important early step in computer-aided drug discovery but remains a difficult task where most campaigns rely on a priori knowledge of binding sites from experiments. Here we present a novel binding site prediction method called Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP) and re-evaluate assumptions in nearly every step in the site prediction workflow from dataset preparation to model evaluation. GrASP is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance at recovering binding sites in PDB structures while maintaining a high degree of precision which will minimize wasted computation in downstream tasks such as docking and free energy perturbation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurotransmitter ligands electrically excite neurons by activating ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) ion channels. Knowledge of the iGluR amino acid residues that dominate ligand-induced activation would enable the prediction of function from sequence. We therefore explored determinants of activity in rat NMDA-type iGluRs (NMDA receptors), complex heteromeric iGluRs comprising two glycine-binding GluN1 and two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits, using amino acid sequence analysis, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology. We find that a broadly conserved aspartate residue controls both ligand potency and channel activity, to the extent that certain substitutions at this position bypass the need for ligand-binding in GluN1 subunits, generating NMDA receptors activated solely by glutamate. Furthermore, we identify a homomeric iGluR from the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens that has utilized this crucial residue to evolve into a leak channel that is inhibited by neurotransmitter binding, pointing to a dominant role of this residue throughout the iGluR superfamily.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein dynamics are intimately tied to biological function and can enable processes such as signal transduction, enzyme catalysis, and molecular recognition. The relative free energies of conformations that contribute to these functional equilibria are evolved for the physiology of the organism. Despite the importance of these equilibria for understanding biological function and developing treatments for disease, the computational and experimental methods capable of quantifying them are limited to systems of modest size. Here, we demonstrate that AlphaFold2 contact distance distributions can approximate conformational Boltzmann distributions, which we evaluate through examination of the joint probability distributions of inter-residue contact distances along functionally relevant collective variables of several protein systems. Further, we show that contact distance probability distributions generated by AlphaFold2 are sensitive to points mutations thus AF2 can predict the structural effects of mutations in some systems. We anticipate that our approach will be a valuable tool to model the thermodynamics of conformational changes in large biomolecular systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are critical for cellular function, yet often appear to lack sequence conservation when assessed by multiple sequence alignments. This raises the question of if and how function can be encoded and preserved in these regions despite massive sequence variation. To address this question, we have applied coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate non-specific RNA binding of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins consist of multiple interspersed disordered and folded domains that bind RNA. We focussed here on the first two domains of coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins, the disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) followed by the folded RNA binding domain (RBD). While the NTD is highly variable across evolution, the RBD is structurally conserved. This combination makes the NTD-RBD a convenient model system to explore the interplay between an IDR adjacent to a folded domain, and how changes in IDR sequence can influence molecular recognition of a partner. Our results reveal a surprising degree of sequence-specificity encoded by both the composition and the precise order of the amino acids in the NTD. The presence of an NTD can - depending on the sequence - either suppress or enhance RNA binding. Despite this sensitivity, large-scale variation in NTD sequences is possible while certain sequence features are retained. Consequently, a conformationally-conserved fuzzy RNA:protein complex is found across nucleocapsid protein orthologs, despite large-scale changes in both NTD sequence and RBD surface chemistry. Taken together, these insights shed light on the ability of disordered regions to preserve functional characteristics despite their sequence variability.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Protein side chain packing (PSCP) is a fundamental problem in the field of protein engineering, as high confidence and low energy conformations of amino acid side chains are crucial for understanding (and designing) protein folding, protein-protein interactions, and protein-ligand interactions. Traditional PSCP methods (such as the Rosetta Packer) often rely on a library of discrete side chain conformations, or rotamers, and a forcefield to guide the structure to low energy conformations. Recently, deep learning (DL) based methods (such as DLPacker, AttnPacker, and DiffPack) have demonstrated state-of-the-art predictions and speed in the PSCP task. Building off the success of graph and message passing neural networks for protein modeling, we present the Protein Invariant Point Packer (PIPPack) which effectively processes local structural and sequence information to produce realistic, idealized side chain coordinates using -angle distribution predictions and geometry-aware invariant point message passing (IPMP). To demonstrate its broad applicability to protein-related tasks, IPMP was additionally incorporated in a fixed backbone protein design method, which enabled the generation of more native-like sequences than common message passing schemes. On a test set of [~]1,400 high-quality protein chains, PIPPack performs competitively with other state-of-the-art PSCP methods in rotamer recovery and per-residue RMSDs but is significantly faster.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Dynamic instability refers to the ability of cytoskeletal polymers to switch between growing and shrinking phases. This phenomenon has been extensively studied for eukaryotic microtubules which consist of 13 protofilaments. Here we report on the dynamic properties of prokaryotic microtubules found in Prosthecobacter bacteria, which consist of 4-5 protofilaments and, like their eukaryotic counterparts, display dynamic instability. Using microfabricated barriers we show that the catastrophe rate of bacterial microtubules increases when their growth is stalled by a rigid barrier. We find that the lifetime distributions of both free and stalled bacterial microtubules can be fitted using the same phenomenological model that we previously introduced for eukaryotic microtubules, suggesting that bacterial microtubules may be considered a model system for eukaryotic microtubules. We further use cryo-electron tomography to reveal structural details of dynamic ends and show that bacterial microtubules may form doublets similar to axonemal microtubules in eukaryotes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Myofibrils in striated muscle cells are chains of regular cytoskeletal units termed sarcomeres, whose contractions drive voluntary movements of animals. Despite the well characterized order of the sarcomere components in mature sarcomeres, which explains the sarcomere contraction mechanism, the mechanism of molecular ordering during sarcomere assembly remains debated. Here, we put forward a theoretical framework for the self-assembly of sarcomeres. This theory is based on measurements of the sequential ordering of sarcomere components in developing Drosophila flight muscles, identified by applying a novel tracking-free algorithm: myosin, -actinin and the titin homologue Sallimus form periodic patterns before actin. Based on these results, we propose that myosin, Sallimus, and sarcomere Z-disc proteins including -actinin dynamically bind and unbind to an unordered bundle of actin filaments to establish an initial periodic pattern. As a consequence, periodicity of actin filaments is only established later. Our model proposes that non-local interactions between spatially extended myosin and titin/Sallimus containing complexes, and possibly tension-dependent feedback mediated by an -actinin catch-bond, drive this ordering process. We probe this hypothesis using mathematical models and derive predictive conditions for sarcomere pattern formation, guiding future experimental analysis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold (AF) in the field of protein sequence-to-structure prediction, modeling protein interfaces and predicting protein complex structures remains challenging, especially when there is a significant conformational change in one or both binding partners. Prior studies have demonstrated that AF-multimer (AFm) can predict accurate protein complexes in only up to 43% of cases. 1 In this work, we combine AlphaFold as a structural template generator with a physics-based replica exchange docking algorithm. Using a curated collection of 254 available protein targets with both unbound and bound structures, we first demonstrate that AlphaFold confidence measures can be repurposed for estimating protein flexibility and docking accuracy for multimers. We incorporate these metrics within our ReplicaDock 2.0 protocol 2 to complete a robust in-silico pipeline for accurate protein complex structure prediction. AlphaRED (AlphaFold-initiated Replica Exchange Docking) successfully docks failed AF predictions including 97 failure cases in Docking Benchmark Set 5.5. AlphaRED generates CAPRI acceptable-quality or better predictions for 66% of benchmark targets. Further, on a subset of antigen-antibody targets, which is challenging for AFm (19% success rate), AlphaRED demonstrates a success rate of 51%. This new strategy demonstrates the success possible by integrating deep-learning based architectures trained on evolutionary information with physics-based enhanced sampling. The pipeline is available at github.com/Graylab/AlphaRED.</p>
