C.\nScore: 12.2, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.05.578888\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates virus attachment to human host cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. To elucidate the structure, dynamics, and functional consequences of these interactions, we carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without heparin chains bound. We find that heparin, a model for HS, promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and heparin binding trigger rearrangement of the S2' functional site through allosteric interdomain communication. HS thus has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS- CoV-2 infection.\nCryo-EM structures of human cone visual pigments\nAuthors: Peng, Q.; Li, J.; Jiang, H.; Cheng, X.; Lu, Q.; Zhou, S.; Zhang, Y.; Lv, S.; Wan, S.; Yang, T.; Chen, Y.; Zhang, W.; Nan, W.; Che, T.; Li, Y.; Liao, H.; Zhang, J.\nScore: 9.0, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.577689\nTrichromatic color vision in humans constitutes a pivotal evolutionary adaptation, endowing individuals with the capacity to discern and discriminate a diverse spectrum of colors. This unique visual capability confers a selective advantage crucial for successful adaptation, survival, and reproductive success in the natural environment. Color vision in humans is facilitated by the red, green, and blue cone visual pigments within cone photoreceptor cells. These pigments consist of a G-protein-coupled receptor opsin apoprotein and a chromophore covalently linked to opsins. Despite the elucidated structure of rhodopsin, the structures of cone visual pigments have yet to be determined. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of three human cone visual pigments in complex with G proteins. Our structural analysis reveals detailed interactions between cone opsins, all-trans-retinal, and G proteins, indicating their active state. We also provide a concise summary and analysis of mutations in human cone opsins, elucidating potential relationships between residue substitutions and spectral tuning. Notably, S1162.67Y, A2335.52S, Y2776.44F were found to induce a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of the red-pigment, while the substitutions W2816.48Y and K3127.43A resulted in the absence of the absorption spectrum. The structural elucidation of human cone visual pigments significantly contributes to our understanding of how distinct types of cone cells perceive light across varying wavelengths. Furthermore, it provides a deeper insight into the functioning of the human trichromatic vision system, probing the mechanisms enabling humans to perceive a broad spectrum of colors.\nInvestigating the mechanisms of enzyme diffusion using mass photometry\nAuthors: Yancheva, Y. D.; Kaya, S. G.; Fraaije, M. W.; Tych, K.\nScore: 8.8, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.28.577687\nThe existence of the phenomenon of enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED) has been a topic of debate in recent literature. The majority of experiments confirming the existence of this phenomenon have been conducted using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), but an artefact has been found in some of these experiments. There are various proposed mechanisms to explain the origin of EED, such as conformational changes and oligomeric enzyme dissociation. In our study we use mass photometry (MP), a label-free single-molecule interferometric light scattering technique, to investigate the dependence of the oligomeric states of several enzymes on the presence or absence of substrate. The enzymes of interest in this study are catalase, aldolase, alkaline phosphatase and an alcohol oxidase (VAO) the first three of which were previously studied in the context of enhanced enzyme diffusion. We compared the ratios of oligomeric states in the presence and absence of substrate as well as different substrate and inhibitor concentrations. Catalase and aldolase were found to dissociate into smaller oligomers with substrate, while for alkaline phosphatase and VAO, different behaviors were observed. Intriguingly, the changes in oligomeric states in aldolase and catalase are independent of catalysis. Thus, we have identified a possible mechanism which explains the previously observed enhanced diffusion of enzymes by oligomer dissociation through ligand binding.\nVisualizing the impact of disease-associated mutations on G protein-nucleotide interactions\nAuthors: Anazia, K.; Koenekoop, L.; Ferre, G.; Petracco, E.; Gutierrez-de-Teran, H.; Eddy, M.\nScore: 8.0, Published: 2024-02-01 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.578006\nActivation of G proteins stimulates ubiquitous intracellular signaling cascades essential for life processes. Under normal physiological conditions, nucleotide exchange is initiated upon the formation of complexes between a G protein and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which facilitates exchange of bound GDP for GTP, subsequently dissociating the trimeric G protein into its G and G{beta}{gamma} subunits. However, single point mutations in G circumvent nucleotide exchange regulated by GPCR-G protein interactions, leading to either loss-of-function or constitutive gain-of-function. Mutations in several G subtypes are closely linked to the development of multiple diseases, including several intractable cancers. We leveraged an integrative spectroscopic and computational approach to investigate the mechanisms by which seven of the most frequently observed clinically-relevant mutations in the subunit of the stimulatory G protein result in functional changes. Variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed a bimodal distribution of thermal melting temperatures across all GS variants. Modeling from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations established a correlation between observed thermal melting temperatures and structural changes caused by the mutations. Concurrently, saturation-transfer difference NMR (STD- NMR) highlighted variations in the interactions of GS variants with bound nucleotides. MD simulations indicated that changes in local interactions within the nucleotide-binding pocket did not consistently align with global structural changes. This collective evidence suggests a multifaceted energy landscape, wherein each mutation may introduce distinct perturbations to the nucleotide-binding site and protein-protein interaction sites. Consequently, it underscores the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to address the unique challenges posed by individual mutations.\nTranslational T-box riboswitches bind tRNA by modulating conformational flexibility\nAuthors: Campos-Chavez, E.; Paul, S.; Zhou, Z.; Alonso, D.; Verma, A. R.; Fei, J.; Mondragon, A.\nScore: 6.8, Published: 2024-02-02 DOI: 10.1101/2024.02.02.578613\nT-box riboswitches, paradigmatic non-coding RNA elements involved in genetic regulation in most Gram-positive bacteria, are adept at monitoring amino acid metabolism through direct interactions with specific tRNAs. T-box riboswitches assess tRNA aminoacylation status, subsequently regulating the transcription or translation of downstream genes involved in amino acid metabolism. Here we present single-molecule FRET studies of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis IleS T-box riboswitch, a model of T-box translational regulation. The data supports a two-step binding model where the tRNA anticodon is recognized first, followed by interactions with the NCCA sequence. Specifically, after anticodon recognition, tRNA in the partially bound state can transiently dock into the discriminator domain, resembling the fully bound state, even in the absence of the tRNA NCCA-discriminator interactions. Establishment of the NCCA-discriminator interactions significantly stabilizes the fully bound state. Collectively, the data suggests higher conformational flexibility in translation-regulating T-box riboswitches, compared to transcription-regulating ones, and supports a conformational selection model for NCCA recognition. Furthermore, it was found that the conserved RAG sequence is pivotal in maintaining specific interactions with the tRNA NCCA sequence by preventing sampling of an aberrant conformational state, while Stem IIA/B-linker interactions impact the conformational dynamics and the stability of both the partially bound and fully bound states. The present study provides a critical kinetic basis for how specific sequences and structural elements in T-box riboswitches enable the binding efficiency and specificity required to achieve gene regulation.\nFtsZ-mediated spatial-temporal control over septal cell wall synthesis\nAuthors: Hu, L.; Perez, A.; Nesterova, T.; Lyu, Z.; Yahashiri, A.; Weiss, D. S.; Xiao, J.; Liu, J.\nScore: 5.8, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577872\nFtsZ, the tubulin-like GTPase, is the central organizer of the bacterial divisome, a macromolecular complex that synthesizes new septal cell wall and degrades old septal cell wall (made of septal peptidoglycan, sPG) to allow cell wall constriction and cytokinesis. In E. coli, it is well accepted that 1) FtsZ recruits all essential divisome proteins to the septum, including the core sPG synthase complex, FtsWI/QLB and its activator, FtsN; 2) FtsWI/QLB must complex with FtsN to produce sPG under the wild-type background; and 3) the Brownian ratcheting by treadmilling FtsZ polymers drives the directional movements of sPG synthase proteins along the septum circumference; and 4) FtsZ is essential for the early stage, but dispensable for the late stage of cell wall constriction. However, it remains unclear how FtsZ spatial-temporally organizes the divisome for robust bacterial cytokinesis throughout cell wall constriction process. Combining theoretical modeling with experiments in E. coli, we show that at the early stage during cell division, the Brownian ratcheting by FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral FtsWI/QLB and FtsN into close contacts for FtsWI/QLB-FtsN complex formation and as a conveyor to maximally homologize the septal distribution of sPG synthesis activities to avoid uneven cell wall constriction. When the septum constricts progressively, the FtsN septal density increases via binding to denuded sPG; consequently, the denuded PG-bound FtsN serves as the template to activate FtsWI/QLB for continued sPG synthesis, rendering FtsZ dispensable. Our work establishes an overarching framework that FtsZ spatial-temporally controls over septal cell wall constriction. SignificanceBacteria utilize FtsZ, the tubulin-like GTPase, to organize cell wall enzymes during cell division. FtsZ forms treadmilling polymers along the septum circumference and drives the directional movement of cell wall enzymes for robust cell wall constriction. How this role is achieved is unclear. We show that FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral cell wall enzymes into close contacts for priming and as a conveyor to homologize the septal distribution of cell wall synthesis activities for even septum constriction. These roles evolve at different stages of cell division and are modulated differentially by different bacteria; they likely define an overarching principle for robust cell division across the microbial world.\nPolymer-extracted structure of the mechanosensitive channel MscS reveals the role of protein-lipid interactions in the gating cycle\nAuthors: Moller, E.; Britt, M.; Zhou, F.; Yang, H.; Anishkin, A.; Ernst, R. K.; Sukharev, S. I.; Matthies, D.\nScore: 6.0, Published: 2024-02-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.22.576751\nMembrane protein structure determination is not only technically challenging but is further complicated by the removal or displacement of lipids, which can result in non-native conformations or a strong preference for certain states at the exclusion of others. This is especially applicable to mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) that evolved to gate in response to subtle changes in membrane tension transmitted through the lipid bilayer. E. coli MscS, a model bacterial system, is an ancestral member of the large family of MSCs found across all phyla of walled organisms. As a tension sensor, MscS is very sensitive and highly adaptive; it readily opens under super-threshold tension and closes under no tension, but under lower tensions, it slowly inactivates and can only recover when tension is released. However, existing cryo-EM structures do not explain the entire functional gating cycle of open, closed, and inactivated states. A central question in the field has been the assignment of the frequently observed non-conductive conformation to either a closed or inactivated state. Here, we present a 3 [A] MscS structure in native nanodiscs obtained with Glyco-DIBMA polymer extraction, eliminating the lipid removal step that is common to all previous structures. Besides the protein in the non-conductive conformation, we observe well-resolved densities of four endogenous phospholipid molecules intercalating between the lipid-facing and pore-lining helices in preferred orientations. Mutations of positively charged residues coordinating these lipids inhibit MscS inactivation, whereas removal of a negative charge near the lipid-filled crevice increases inactivation. The functional data allows us to assign this class of structures to the inactivated state. This structure reveals preserved lipids in their native locations, and the functional effects of their destabilization illustrate a novel inactivation mechanism based on an uncoupling of the peripheral tension-sensing helices from the gate.\niPAR: a new reporter for eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein aggregation\nAuthors: Lecinski, S.; MacDonald, C.; Leake, M. C.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.29.577793\n1.Cells employ myriad regulatory mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis, termed proteostasis, to ensure correct cellular function. Dysregulation of proteostasis, which is often induced by physiological stress and ageing, often results in Protein Aggregation in cells. These aggregated structures can perturb normal physiological function, compromising cell integrity and viability, a prime example being early onset of several neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding aggregate dynamics in vivo is therefore of strong interest for biomedicine and pharmacology. However, factors involved in formation, distribution and clearance of intracellular aggregates are poorly understood. Here, we report an improved methodology for production of fluorescent aggregates in model budding yeast which can be detected, tracked and quantified using fluorescence microscopy in live cells. This new openly-available technology, iPAR (inducible Protein Aggregation Reporter), involves monomeric fluorescent protein reporters fused to a {Delta}ssCPY* aggregation biomarker, with expression controlled under the copper-regulated CUP1 promoter. Monomeric tags overcome challenges associated with non-physiological aggregation, whilst CUP1 provides more precise control of protein production. We show that iPAR enables quantitative study of cytoplasmic aggregate kinetics and inheritance features in vivo. If suitably adapted, iPAR offers new potential for studying diseases in other model cellular systems.\nScorpion α-toxin LqhαIT specifically interacts with a glycan at the pore domain of voltage-gated sodium channels\nAuthors: Phulera, S.; Dickson, C. J.; Schwalen, C. J.; Khoshouei, M.; Cassell, S. J.; Sun, Y.; Condos, T.; Whicher, J.; Weihofen, W. A.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-30 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577479\nVoltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels sense membrane potential and drive cellular electrical activity. Numerous protein toxins have been identified that modulate Nav gating, and structures of Nav channels in complex with these toxins helped elucidate the molecular mechanisms of voltage-dependent channel gating. The deathstalker scorpion -toxin LqhIT exerts a strong action potential prolonging effect on Nav channels. Biochemical studies show that LqhIT features a functionally essential epitope at its C-terminus that is not shared with related scorpion -toxins. To elucidate the mechanism of action of LqhIT, we determined a 3.9 [A] cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of LqhIT in complex with the Nav channel from Periplaneta americana (NavPas). We found that LqhIT binds to voltage sensor domain 4 and traps it in a \"S4 down\" conformation to stabilize the open state. To promote binding, the functionally essential C-terminal epitope of LqhIT forms an extensive interface with the glycan scaffold linked to Asn330 of NavPas that augments a small protein-protein interface between NavPas and LqhIT. A combination of molecular dynamics simulations, structural comparisons, and prior mutagenesis experiments demonstrate the functional importance of this toxin-glycan interaction. These findings help establish a structural basis for the specificity achieved by scorpion -toxins and provide crucial insights for the development and optimization of new Nav channel modulators.\nCell aspect ratio is a mechanical winning strategy in microbial competition\nAuthors: van den Berg, N.; Thijssen, K.; Nguyen, T. T.; Sarlet, A.; Cordero, M.; Vazquez, A. G.; Mitarai, N.; Doostmohammadi, A.; Jauffred, L.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2024-01-27 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.577059\nBacterias competition for nutrients and territory drives biofilm evolution (1-4). The factors determining the outcome of competition among diverse bacterial species have a broad impact on a wide range of pathological (5), environmental (6), and microbiome interactions (7). While motility-related traits (8-11) and specific molecular mechanisms (12, 13) have been identified as potential winning attributes in bacteria, a shared and universally conserved feature determining competition remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a simple morphological feature of individual bacteria, cell aspect ratio, provides a winning trait for the population. Using range expansion experiments (14), we show that relatively longer bacteria robustly conquer the expanding front, even when initially in minority. Using an agent-based model of dividing bacteria, we reveal that the takeover mechanism is their emergent collective alignment: groups of locally aligned bacteria form \"nematic arms\" bridging the central region of the colony to the expanding front. Once at the front, bacteria align parallel to it and block the access of shorter bacteria to nutrients and space. We confirm this observation with single-cell experiments and further generalise our findings by introducing a generic continuum model of alignment-dominated competition, explaining both experimental and cell-based model observations. Moreover, we extend our predictions to spherical range expansions (15) and confirm the competitive advantage of being longer, even though the effect is less pronounced than in surface-attached colonies. Our results uncover a simple, yet hitherto overlooked, mechanical mechanism determining the outcome of bacterial competition, which is potentially ubiquitous among various bacteria. With the current advances in genetic engineering, varying aspect ratios can work as a simple tunable mechanism for the on-demand setting of the outcome of bacterial competitions with widespread implications for biofilm control.\n",

        <p class="abstract">The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates virus attachment to human host cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. To elucidate the structure, dynamics, and functional consequences of these interactions, we carried out microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, followed by random acceleration molecular dynamics simulations, of the fully glycosylated spike:ACE2 complex with and without heparin chains bound. We find that heparin, a model for HS, promotes structural and energetic stabilization of the active conformation of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and reorientation of ACE2 toward the N-terminal domain in the same spike subunit as the RBD. Spike and ACE2 N-glycans exert synergistic effects, promoting better packing, strengthening the protein:protein interaction, and prolonging the residence time of the complex. ACE2 and heparin binding trigger rearrangement of the S2&#39; functional site through allosteric interdomain communication. HS thus has a multifaceted role in facilitating SARS- CoV-2 infection.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Trichromatic color vision in humans constitutes a pivotal evolutionary adaptation, endowing individuals with the capacity to discern and discriminate a diverse spectrum of colors. This unique visual capability confers a selective advantage crucial for successful adaptation, survival, and reproductive success in the natural environment. Color vision in humans is facilitated by the red, green, and blue cone visual pigments within cone photoreceptor cells. These pigments consist of a G-protein-coupled receptor opsin apoprotein and a chromophore covalently linked to opsins. Despite the elucidated structure of rhodopsin, the structures of cone visual pigments have yet to be determined. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of three human cone visual pigments in complex with G proteins. Our structural analysis reveals detailed interactions between cone opsins, all-trans-retinal, and G proteins, indicating their active state. We also provide a concise summary and analysis of mutations in human cone opsins, elucidating potential relationships between residue substitutions and spectral tuning. Notably, S1162.67Y, A2335.52S, Y2776.44F were found to induce a blue shift in the absorption spectrum of the red-pigment, while the substitutions W2816.48Y and K3127.43A resulted in the absence of the absorption spectrum. The structural elucidation of human cone visual pigments significantly contributes to our understanding of how distinct types of cone cells perceive light across varying wavelengths. Furthermore, it provides a deeper insight into the functioning of the human trichromatic vision system, probing the mechanisms enabling humans to perceive a broad spectrum of colors.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The existence of the phenomenon of enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED) has been a topic of debate in recent literature. The majority of experiments confirming the existence of this phenomenon have been conducted using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), but an artefact has been found in some of these experiments. There are various proposed mechanisms to explain the origin of EED, such as conformational changes and oligomeric enzyme dissociation. In our study we use mass photometry (MP), a label-free single-molecule interferometric light scattering technique, to investigate the dependence of the oligomeric states of several enzymes on the presence or absence of substrate. The enzymes of interest in this study are catalase, aldolase, alkaline phosphatase and an alcohol oxidase (VAO) the first three of which were previously studied in the context of enhanced enzyme diffusion. We compared the ratios of oligomeric states in the presence and absence of substrate as well as different substrate and inhibitor concentrations. Catalase and aldolase were found to dissociate into smaller oligomers with substrate, while for alkaline phosphatase and VAO, different behaviors were observed. Intriguingly, the changes in oligomeric states in aldolase and catalase are independent of catalysis. Thus, we have identified a possible mechanism which explains the previously observed enhanced diffusion of enzymes by oligomer dissociation through ligand binding.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Activation of G proteins stimulates ubiquitous intracellular signaling cascades essential for life processes. Under normal physiological conditions, nucleotide exchange is initiated upon the formation of complexes between a G protein and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which facilitates exchange of bound GDP for GTP, subsequently dissociating the trimeric G protein into its G and G{beta}{gamma} subunits. However, single point mutations in G circumvent nucleotide exchange regulated by GPCR-G protein interactions, leading to either loss-of-function or constitutive gain-of-function. Mutations in several G subtypes are closely linked to the development of multiple diseases, including several intractable cancers. We leveraged an integrative spectroscopic and computational approach to investigate the mechanisms by which seven of the most frequently observed clinically-relevant mutations in the  subunit of the stimulatory G protein result in functional changes. Variable temperature circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed a bimodal distribution of thermal melting temperatures across all GS variants. Modeling from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations established a correlation between observed thermal melting temperatures and structural changes caused by the mutations. Concurrently, saturation-transfer difference NMR (STD- NMR) highlighted variations in the interactions of GS variants with bound nucleotides. MD simulations indicated that changes in local interactions within the nucleotide-binding pocket did not consistently align with global structural changes. This collective evidence suggests a multifaceted energy landscape, wherein each mutation may introduce distinct perturbations to the nucleotide-binding site and protein-protein interaction sites. Consequently, it underscores the importance of tailoring therapeutic strategies to address the unique challenges posed by individual mutations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">T-box riboswitches, paradigmatic non-coding RNA elements involved in genetic regulation in most Gram-positive bacteria, are adept at monitoring amino acid metabolism through direct interactions with specific tRNAs. T-box riboswitches assess tRNA aminoacylation status, subsequently regulating the transcription or translation of downstream genes involved in amino acid metabolism. Here we present single-molecule FRET studies of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis IleS T-box riboswitch, a model of T-box translational regulation. The data supports a two-step binding model where the tRNA anticodon is recognized first, followed by interactions with the NCCA sequence. Specifically, after anticodon recognition, tRNA in the partially bound state can transiently dock into the discriminator domain, resembling the fully bound state, even in the absence of the tRNA NCCA-discriminator interactions. Establishment of the NCCA-discriminator interactions significantly stabilizes the fully bound state. Collectively, the data suggests higher conformational flexibility in translation-regulating T-box riboswitches, compared to transcription-regulating ones, and supports a conformational selection model for NCCA recognition. Furthermore, it was found that the conserved RAG sequence is pivotal in maintaining specific interactions with the tRNA NCCA sequence by preventing sampling of an aberrant conformational state, while Stem IIA/B-linker interactions impact the conformational dynamics and the stability of both the partially bound and fully bound states. The present study provides a critical kinetic basis for how specific sequences and structural elements in T-box riboswitches enable the binding efficiency and specificity required to achieve gene regulation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">FtsZ, the tubulin-like GTPase, is the central organizer of the bacterial divisome, a macromolecular complex that synthesizes new septal cell wall and degrades old septal cell wall (made of septal peptidoglycan, sPG) to allow cell wall constriction and cytokinesis. In E. coli, it is well accepted that 1) FtsZ recruits all essential divisome proteins to the septum, including the core sPG synthase complex, FtsWI/QLB and its activator, FtsN; 2) FtsWI/QLB must complex with FtsN to produce sPG under the wild-type background; and 3) the Brownian ratcheting by treadmilling FtsZ polymers drives the directional movements of sPG synthase proteins along the septum circumference; and 4) FtsZ is essential for the early stage, but dispensable for the late stage of cell wall constriction. However, it remains unclear how FtsZ spatial-temporally organizes the divisome for robust bacterial cytokinesis throughout cell wall constriction process. Combining theoretical modeling with experiments in E. coli, we show that at the early stage during cell division, the Brownian ratcheting by FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral FtsWI/QLB and FtsN into close contacts for FtsWI/QLB-FtsN complex formation and as a conveyor to maximally homologize the septal distribution of sPG synthesis activities to avoid uneven cell wall constriction. When the septum constricts progressively, the FtsN septal density increases via binding to denuded sPG; consequently, the denuded PG-bound FtsN serves as the template to activate FtsWI/QLB for continued sPG synthesis, rendering FtsZ dispensable. Our work establishes an overarching framework that FtsZ spatial-temporally controls over septal cell wall constriction.

SignificanceBacteria utilize FtsZ, the tubulin-like GTPase, to organize cell wall enzymes during cell division. FtsZ forms treadmilling polymers along the septum circumference and drives the directional movement of cell wall enzymes for robust cell wall constriction. How this role is achieved is unclear. We show that FtsZ treadmilling acts both as a template to corral cell wall enzymes into close contacts for priming and as a conveyor to homologize the septal distribution of cell wall synthesis activities for even septum constriction. These roles evolve at different stages of cell division and are modulated differentially by different bacteria; they likely define an overarching principle for robust cell division across the microbial world.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane protein structure determination is not only technically challenging but is further complicated by the removal or displacement of lipids, which can result in non-native conformations or a strong preference for certain states at the exclusion of others. This is especially applicable to mechanosensitive channels (MSCs) that evolved to gate in response to subtle changes in membrane tension transmitted through the lipid bilayer. E. coli MscS, a model bacterial system, is an ancestral member of the large family of MSCs found across all phyla of walled organisms. As a tension sensor, MscS is very sensitive and highly adaptive; it readily opens under super-threshold tension and closes under no tension, but under lower tensions, it slowly inactivates and can only recover when tension is released. However, existing cryo-EM structures do not explain the entire functional gating cycle of open, closed, and inactivated states. A central question in the field has been the assignment of the frequently observed non-conductive conformation to either a closed or inactivated state. Here, we present a 3 [A] MscS structure in native nanodiscs obtained with Glyco-DIBMA polymer extraction, eliminating the lipid removal step that is common to all previous structures. Besides the protein in the non-conductive conformation, we observe well-resolved densities of four endogenous phospholipid molecules intercalating between the lipid-facing and pore-lining helices in preferred orientations. Mutations of positively charged residues coordinating these lipids inhibit MscS inactivation, whereas removal of a negative charge near the lipid-filled crevice increases inactivation. The functional data allows us to assign this class of structures to the inactivated state. This structure reveals preserved lipids in their native locations, and the functional effects of their destabilization illustrate a novel inactivation mechanism based on an uncoupling of the peripheral tension-sensing helices from the gate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">1.Cells employ myriad regulatory mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis, termed proteostasis, to ensure correct cellular function. Dysregulation of proteostasis, which is often induced by physiological stress and ageing, often results in Protein Aggregation in cells. These aggregated structures can perturb normal physiological function, compromising cell integrity and viability, a prime example being early onset of several neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding aggregate dynamics in vivo is therefore of strong interest for biomedicine and pharmacology. However, factors involved in formation, distribution and clearance of intracellular aggregates are poorly understood. Here, we report an improved methodology for production of fluorescent aggregates in model budding yeast which can be detected, tracked and quantified using fluorescence microscopy in live cells. This new openly-available technology, iPAR (inducible Protein Aggregation Reporter), involves monomeric fluorescent protein reporters fused to a {Delta}ssCPY* aggregation biomarker, with expression controlled under the copper-regulated CUP1 promoter. Monomeric tags overcome challenges associated with non-physiological aggregation, whilst CUP1 provides more precise control of protein production. We show that iPAR enables quantitative study of cytoplasmic aggregate kinetics and inheritance features in vivo. If suitably adapted, iPAR offers new potential for studying diseases in other model cellular systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels sense membrane potential and drive cellular electrical activity. Numerous protein toxins have been identified that modulate Nav gating, and structures of Nav channels in complex with these toxins helped elucidate the molecular mechanisms of voltage-dependent channel gating. The deathstalker scorpion -toxin LqhIT exerts a strong action potential prolonging effect on Nav channels. Biochemical studies show that LqhIT features a functionally essential epitope at its C-terminus that is not shared with related scorpion -toxins. To elucidate the mechanism of action of LqhIT, we determined a 3.9 [A] cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of LqhIT in complex with the Nav channel from Periplaneta americana (NavPas). We found that LqhIT binds to voltage sensor domain 4 and traps it in a &#34;S4 down&#34; conformation to stabilize the open state. To promote binding, the functionally essential C-terminal epitope of LqhIT forms an extensive interface with the glycan scaffold linked to Asn330 of NavPas that augments a small protein-protein interface between NavPas and LqhIT. A combination of molecular dynamics simulations, structural comparisons, and prior mutagenesis experiments demonstrate the functional importance of this toxin-glycan interaction. These findings help establish a structural basis for the specificity achieved by scorpion -toxins and provide crucial insights for the development and optimization of new Nav channel modulators.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Bacterias competition for nutrients and territory drives biofilm evolution (1-4). The factors determining the outcome of competition among diverse bacterial species have a broad impact on a wide range of pathological (5), environmental (6), and microbiome interactions (7). While motility-related traits (8-11) and specific molecular mechanisms (12, 13) have been identified as potential winning attributes in bacteria, a shared and universally conserved feature determining competition remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a simple morphological feature of individual bacteria, cell aspect ratio, provides a winning trait for the population. Using range expansion experiments (14), we show that relatively longer bacteria robustly conquer the expanding front, even when initially in minority. Using an agent-based model of dividing bacteria, we reveal that the takeover mechanism is their emergent collective alignment: groups of locally aligned bacteria form &#34;nematic arms&#34; bridging the central region of the colony to the expanding front. Once at the front, bacteria align parallel to it and block the access of shorter bacteria to nutrients and space. We confirm this observation with single-cell experiments and further generalise our findings by introducing a generic continuum model of alignment-dominated competition, explaining both experimental and cell-based model observations. Moreover, we extend our predictions to spherical range expansions (15) and confirm the competitive advantage of being longer, even though the effect is less pronounced than in surface-attached colonies. Our results uncover a simple, yet hitherto overlooked, mechanical mechanism determining the outcome of bacterial competition, which is potentially ubiquitous among various bacteria. With the current advances in genetic engineering, varying aspect ratios can work as a simple tunable mechanism for the on-demand setting of the outcome of bacterial competitions with widespread implications for biofilm control.</p>
