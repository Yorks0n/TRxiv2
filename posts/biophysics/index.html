Here we describe a platform which uses nanopipettes to deliver defined numbers of macromolecules into cultured cell lines and primary cells at single molecule resolution. In the nanoinjection platform the nanopipette is used as both a scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) scanning probe and as an injection probe. The SICM is used to position the nanopipette above the cell surface, before the nanopipette is inserted into the cell into a defined location and to a predefined depth. We demonstrate that the nanoinjection platform enables the quantitative delivery of DNA, globular proteins and protein fibrils into cells with single molecule resolution and that delivery results in a phenotypic change in the cell that depends on the identity of the molecules introduced. Using experiments and computational modelling, we also show that macromolecular crowding in the cell increases the signal to noise ratio for the detection of translocation events, thus the cell itself enhances the detection of the molecules delivered.\nUser-friendly Oblique Plane Microscopy on a fully functional commercially available microscope base\nAuthors: Sirinakis, G.; Allgeyer, E. S.; Nashchekin, D.; St Johnston, D.\nScore: 11.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574832\nIn this work we present an Oblique Plane Microscope designed to work seamlessly with a commercially available microscope base. To support all the functionality offered by the microscope base, where the position of the objective lens is not fixed, we adopted a two-mirror scanning geometry that can compensate for changes to the position of the objective lens during routine microscope operation. We showed that within the expected displacement range of the 100X, 1.35 NA objective lens away from its designed position, and for most practical applications, there is no significant effect on the resolving power, or the fidelity of the 3D data produced by the microscope. Compared to the more traditional scan-lens/galvo-mirror combination, the two-mirror scanning geometry offers higher light-efficiency and a more compact footprint, which could be beneficial to all OPM designs regardless of the use of a commercial base or not.\nLipid osmosis, membrane tension, and other mechanochemical driving forces of lipid flow\nAuthors: Zhang, Y.; Lin, C.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.574656\nNonvesicular lipid transport among different membranes or membrane domains plays crucial roles in processes such as lipid homeostasis and organelle biogenesis. However, the forces that drive such lipid transport are not well understood. We propose that lipids tend to flow towards the membrane area with a higher membrane protein density in a process termed lipid osmosis. This process lowers the membrane tension in the area when the lipid flow reaches equilibrium. We examine the thermodynamic basis and experimental evidence of lipid osmosis and the corresponding osmotic membrane tension. We predict that lipid osmosis can drive lipid flows between different membrane regions through lipid transfer proteins, scramblases, or other similar barriers that selectively pass lipids but not membrane proteins. We also speculate on the biological functions of lipid osmosis. Finally, we explore other driving forces for lipid transfer and describe potential methods and systems to further test our theory.\nMeasuring concentration of nanoparticles in polydisperse mixtures using interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA)\nAuthors: Kashkanova, A. D.; Albrecht, D.; Kueppers, M.; Blessing, M.; Sandoghdar, V.\nScore: 9.8, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.574819\nQuantitative measurements of nanoparticle concentration in liquid suspensions are in high demand, for example, in the medical and food industries. Conventional methods remain unsatisfactory, especially for polydisperse samples with overlapping size ranges. Recently, we introduced interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA) as a new method for high-precision measurement of nanoparticle size and refractive index. Here, we show that by counting the number of trajectories that cross the focal plane, iNTA can measure concentrations of subpopulations in a polydisperse mixture in a quantitative manner and without the need for a calibration sample. We evaluate our method on both monodisperse samples and mixtures of known concentrations. Furthermore, we assess the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in supernatant samples obtained from infected cells.\nOblique Line Scan Illumination Enables Expansive, Accurate and Sensitive Single Protein Measurements in Solution and in Living Cells\nAuthors: Driouchi, A.; Bretan, M.; Davis, B.

J.\nScore: 14.1, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.21.571765\nSingle-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as single-molecule tracking (SMT), enable in situ measurements in cells from which data-rich metrics can be extracted. SMT has been successfully applied to a variety of biological questions and model systems, aiming to unravel the spatiotemporal regulation of molecular mechanisms that govern protein function, downstream pathway effects, and cellular function. While powerful, SMLM often suffers from low throughput and illumination inhomogeneity, along with microscope and user-induced technical biases. Due to technical limitations in scaling SMLM techniques, a tradeoff between spatiotemporal resolution and throughput has been made historically, restricting broad application of these technologies. Here we address these limitations using Oblique Line Scan (OLS), a robust single-objective light-sheet based illumination and detection modality that achieves nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a 250 x 190 m field of view. We demonstrate OLS-enabled SMT on Halo-Tagged proteins in living cells capturing protein motion up to 14 m2 /s. By exploiting the adaptability of the acquisition frame rate and the improved rejection of out of focus light, we extend the utility of OLS beyond cellular compartments with in-solution SMT (isSMT) for single-molecule measurement of ligand-protein interactions and disruption of protein-protein interactions (PPI). We illustrate the versatility of OLS by showcasing two-color SMT, STORM, and single molecule fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). OLS expands the range of SMLM applications and paves the way for robust, high-throughput single-molecule investigations of protein dynamics required for drug screening and systems biology studies, both in cells and in solution.\nActive membrane deformations of a minimal synthetic cell\nAuthors: Sciortino, A.; Faizi, H.; Uplap, S.; Frechette, L.; Peterson, M. S.; Vlahovska, P.; Baskaran, A.; Hagan, M. F.; Bausch, A.\nScore: 49.6, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571643\nBiological cells exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt their shape in response to their environment, a phenomenon that hinges on the intricate interplay between their deformable membrane and the underlying activity of their cytoskeleton. Yet, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain mostly elusive. Here, we introduce a synthetic cell model, comprised of an active cytoskeletal network of microtubules, crosslinkers and molecular motors encapsulated inside giant vesicles. Remarkably, these active vesicles exhibit large shape fluctuations and life-like morphing abilities. Active forces from the encapsulated cytoskeleton give rise to large-scale traveling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule fluctuations shows how the intricate coupling of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces yields fluctuation spectra whose characteristic scales in space and time are distinctly different from passive vesicles. We demonstrate how activity leads to uneven probability fluxes between fluctuation modes and hence sets the temporal scale of membrane fluctuations. Using simulations and theoretical modelling, we extend the classical approach to membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, highlighting the effect of correlated activity on the dynamics of membrane deformations and paving the way for quantitative descriptions of the shape-morphing ability typical of living systems.\nUncovering kinesin dynamics in neurites with MINFLUX\nAuthors: Wirth, J. O.; Schentarra, E. M.; Scheiderer, L.; Palacios, V. M.; Tarnawski, M.; Hell, S. W.\nScore: 17.8, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571866\nNeurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly observed on microtubules polymerized on glass coverslips. A gentle fixation protocol largely maintains the structure and surface modifications of the microtubules in the cell. By analyzing the time between the substeps, we identify the ATP-binding state of kinesin-1 and observe the associated rotation of the kinesin-1 head in neurites. We also observed kinesin-1 switching microtubules mid-walk, highlighting the potential of MINFLUX to study the details of active cellular transport.\nEmergence of synchronised growth oscillations in filamentous fungi\nAuthors: Prakash, P.; Jiang, X.; Richards, L.; Schofield, Z.; Schafer, P.; Polin, M.; Soyer, O. s.; Asally, M. s.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-12-23 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573137\nSoil fungi are important decomposers of organic matter and play crucial roles in the biogeochemical cycles in the soil. Many species of fungi grow in the form of branched networks. While there have been investigations on the growth and architecture of the fungal networks, their growth dynamics in space and time is still not fully understood. In this study, we monitor the growth dynamics of the plant-promoting filamentous fungus Serendipita indica for several days in a controlled environment within a microfluidic channel. We find that this species displays synchronized growth oscillations with the onset of sporulation and at a period of 3 hours. Quantifying this experimental synchronisation of oscillatory dynamics, we show that the synchronisation can be captured by the nearest neighbour Kuramoto model. Our analysis suggested the existence of millimetre-scale cell-cell communication across the fungi network. The microfluidic setup presented in this work may aid the future characterization of the molecular mechanisms of the cell-cell communication, which could in turn be exploited in order to control fungi growth and reproductive sporulation in soil and plant health management.\nCholesterol-Dependent Membrane Deformation by Metastable Viral Capsids Facilitates Entry\nAuthors: Jiao, M.; Danthi, P.; Yu, Y.\nScore: 3.8, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575085\nNon-enveloped viruses employ unique entry mechanisms to breach and infect host cells. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing antiviral strategies. Prevailing perspective suggests that non-enveloped viruses release membrane lytic peptides to breach host membranes. However, the precise involvement of the viral capsid in this entry remains elusive. Our study presents direct observations elucidating the dynamically distinctive steps through which metastable reovirus capsids disrupt host lipid membranes as they uncoat into partially hydrophobic intermediate particles. Using both live cells and model membrane systems, our key finding is that reovirus capsids actively deform and permeabilize lipid membranes in a cholesterol-dependent process. Unlike membrane lytic peptides, these metastable viral capsids induce more extensive membrane perturbations, including budding, bridging between adjacent membranes, and complete rupture. Notably, cholesterol enhances subviral particle adsorption, resulting in the formation of pores equivalent to the capsid size . This cholesterol dependence is attributed to the lipid condensing effect, particularly prominent at intermediate cholesterol level . Furthermore, our results reveal a positive correlation between membrane disruption extent and efficiency of viral variants in establishing infection. This study unveils the crucial role of capsid-lipid interaction in non-enveloped virus entry, providing new insights into how cholesterol homeostasis influences virus infection dynamics.\nStructural dynamics of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase active site are influenced by coenzyme F430 modifications\nAuthors: Poleto, M. D.; Allen, K. D.; Lemkul, J. A.\nScore: 3.7, Published: 2024-01-08 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.574536\nMethyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a central player in methane biogeochemistry, governing methanogenesis and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in methanogens and anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME), respectively. The prosthetic group of MCR is coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing tetrapyrrole derivative. Additionally, a few modified versions of F430 have been discovered, including the 172-methylthio-F430 (mt-F430) that functions with ANME-1 MCR. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel the intricacies of the active-site dynamics of MCR from Methanosarcina acetivorans and ANME-1 when bound to the canonical F430 compared to 172-thioether coenzyme F430 variants and substrates for methane formation. Overall, our simulations indicate that each MCR active site is optimized for a given version of F430 and support the importance of the Gln to Val substitution in accommodating the 172 methylthio modification. Notably, modifications in the 172 position disrupt the canonical coordination among cofactors in M. acetivorans MCR, implicating structural perturbations, but evidence of active site reorganization to maintain substrate positions suggest that the modified F430s could be accommodated in a methanogenic MCR. We additionally report the first quantitative estimate of MCR intrinsic electric fields pivotal in driving methane formation. Our results suggest that the electric field aligned along the CH3-S-CoM thioether bond facilitates homolytic bond cleavage, coinciding with the proposed catalytic mechanism. Structural perturbations, however, weaken and misalign these electric fields, emphasizing the significance of the active site structure in maintaining their integrity. In conclusion, our results deepen the understanding of MCR active-site dynamics, the enzymes organizational role in intrinsic electric fields for catalysis, and the interplay between active site structure and electrostatics. This work not only advances our comprehension of MCR functionality but also provides a foundation for future investigations employing sophisticated models to capture the complex electronic properties of MCR active sites quantitatively.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Controlled manipulation of cultured cells by delivery of exogenous macromolecules is a cornerstone of experimental biology. Here we describe a platform which uses nanopipettes to deliver defined numbers of macromolecules into cultured cell lines and primary cells at single molecule resolution. In the nanoinjection platform the nanopipette is used as both a scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) scanning probe and as an injection probe. The SICM is used to position the nanopipette above the cell surface, before the nanopipette is inserted into the cell into a defined location and to a predefined depth. We demonstrate that the nanoinjection platform enables the quantitative delivery of DNA, globular proteins and protein fibrils into cells with single molecule resolution and that delivery results in a phenotypic change in the cell that depends on the identity of the molecules introduced. Using experiments and computational modelling, we also show that macromolecular crowding in the cell increases the signal to noise ratio for the detection of translocation events, thus the cell itself enhances the detection of the molecules delivered.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In this work we present an Oblique Plane Microscope designed to work seamlessly with a commercially available microscope base. To support all the functionality offered by the microscope base, where the position of the objective lens is not fixed, we adopted a two-mirror scanning geometry that can compensate for changes to the position of the objective lens during routine microscope operation. We showed that within the expected displacement range of the 100X, 1.35 NA objective lens away from its designed position, and for most practical applications, there is no significant effect on the resolving power, or the fidelity of the 3D data produced by the microscope. Compared to the more traditional scan-lens/galvo-mirror combination, the two-mirror scanning geometry offers higher light-efficiency and a more compact footprint, which could be beneficial to all OPM designs regardless of the use of a commercial base or not.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nonvesicular lipid transport among different membranes or membrane domains plays crucial roles in processes such as lipid homeostasis and organelle biogenesis. However, the forces that drive such lipid transport are not well understood. We propose that lipids tend to flow towards the membrane area with a higher membrane protein density in a process termed lipid osmosis. This process lowers the membrane tension in the area when the lipid flow reaches equilibrium. We examine the thermodynamic basis and experimental evidence of lipid osmosis and the corresponding osmotic membrane tension. We predict that lipid osmosis can drive lipid flows between different membrane regions through lipid transfer proteins, scramblases, or other similar barriers that selectively pass lipids but not membrane proteins. We also speculate on the biological functions of lipid osmosis. Finally, we explore other driving forces for lipid transfer and describe potential methods and systems to further test our theory.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Quantitative measurements of nanoparticle concentration in liquid suspensions are in high demand, for example, in the medical and food industries. Conventional methods remain unsatisfactory, especially for polydisperse samples with overlapping size ranges. Recently, we introduced interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA) as a new method for high-precision measurement of nanoparticle size and refractive index. Here, we show that by counting the number of trajectories that cross the focal plane, iNTA can measure concentrations of subpopulations in a polydisperse mixture in a quantitative manner and without the need for a calibration sample. We evaluate our method on both monodisperse samples and mixtures of known concentrations. Furthermore, we assess the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in supernatant samples obtained from infected cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques, such as single-molecule tracking (SMT), enable in situ measurements in cells from which data-rich metrics can be extracted. SMT has been successfully applied to a variety of biological questions and model systems, aiming to unravel the spatiotemporal regulation of molecular mechanisms that govern protein function, downstream pathway effects, and cellular function. While powerful, SMLM often suffers from low throughput and illumination inhomogeneity, along with microscope and user-induced technical biases. Due to technical limitations in scaling SMLM techniques, a tradeoff between spatiotemporal resolution and throughput has been made historically, restricting broad application of these technologies. Here we address these limitations using Oblique Line Scan (OLS), a robust single-objective light-sheet based illumination and detection modality that achieves nanoscale spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution across a 250 x 190 m field of view. We demonstrate OLS-enabled SMT on Halo-Tagged proteins in living cells capturing protein motion up to 14 m2 /s. By exploiting the adaptability of the acquisition frame rate and the improved rejection of out of focus light, we extend the utility of OLS beyond cellular compartments with in-solution SMT (isSMT) for single-molecule measurement of ligand-protein interactions and disruption of protein-protein interactions (PPI). We illustrate the versatility of OLS by showcasing two-color SMT, STORM, and single molecule fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). OLS expands the range of SMLM applications and paves the way for robust, high-throughput single-molecule investigations of protein dynamics required for drug screening and systems biology studies, both in cells and in solution.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological cells exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt their shape in response to their environment, a phenomenon that hinges on the intricate interplay between their deformable membrane and the underlying activity of their cytoskeleton. Yet, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain mostly elusive. Here, we introduce a synthetic cell model, comprised of an active cytoskeletal network of microtubules, crosslinkers and molecular motors encapsulated inside giant vesicles. Remarkably, these active vesicles exhibit large shape fluctuations and life-like morphing abilities. Active forces from the encapsulated cytoskeleton give rise to large-scale traveling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule fluctuations shows how the intricate coupling of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces yields fluctuation spectra whose characteristic scales in space and time are distinctly different from passive vesicles. We demonstrate how activity leads to uneven probability fluxes between fluctuation modes and hence sets the temporal scale of membrane fluctuations. Using simulations and theoretical modelling, we extend the classical approach to membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, highlighting the effect of correlated activity on the dynamics of membrane deformations and paving the way for quantitative descriptions of the shape-morphing ability typical of living systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly observed on microtubules polymerized on glass coverslips. A gentle fixation protocol largely maintains the structure and surface modifications of the microtubules in the cell. By analyzing the time between the substeps, we identify the ATP-binding state of kinesin-1 and observe the associated rotation of the kinesin-1 head in neurites. We also observed kinesin-1 switching microtubules mid-walk, highlighting the potential of MINFLUX to study the details of active cellular transport.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Soil fungi are important decomposers of organic matter and play crucial roles in the biogeochemical cycles in the soil. Many species of fungi grow in the form of branched networks. While there have been investigations on the growth and architecture of the fungal networks, their growth dynamics in space and time is still not fully understood. In this study, we monitor the growth dynamics of the plant-promoting filamentous fungus Serendipita indica for several days in a controlled environment within a microfluidic channel. We find that this species displays synchronized growth oscillations with the onset of sporulation and at a period of 3 hours. Quantifying this experimental synchronisation of oscillatory dynamics, we show that the synchronisation can be captured by the nearest neighbour Kuramoto model. Our analysis suggested the existence of millimetre-scale cell-cell communication across the fungi network. The microfluidic setup presented in this work may aid the future characterization of the molecular mechanisms of the cell-cell communication, which could in turn be exploited in order to control fungi growth and reproductive sporulation in soil and plant health management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Non-enveloped viruses employ unique entry mechanisms to breach and infect host cells. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing antiviral strategies. Prevailing perspective suggests that non-enveloped viruses release membrane lytic peptides to breach host membranes. However, the precise involvement of the viral capsid in this entry remains elusive. Our study presents direct observations elucidating the dynamically distinctive steps through which metastable reovirus capsids disrupt host lipid membranes as they uncoat into partially hydrophobic intermediate particles. Using both live cells and model membrane systems, our key finding is that reovirus capsids actively deform and permeabilize lipid membranes in a cholesterol-dependent process. Unlike membrane lytic peptides, these metastable viral capsids induce more extensive membrane perturbations, including budding, bridging between adjacent membranes, and complete rupture. Notably, cholesterol enhances subviral particle adsorption, resulting in the formation of pores equivalent to the capsid size . This cholesterol dependence is attributed to the lipid condensing effect, particularly prominent at intermediate cholesterol level . Furthermore, our results reveal a positive correlation between membrane disruption extent and efficiency of viral variants in establishing infection. This study unveils the crucial role of capsid-lipid interaction in non-enveloped virus entry, providing new insights into how cholesterol homeostasis influences virus infection dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a central player in methane biogeochemistry, governing methanogenesis and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in methanogens and anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME), respectively. The prosthetic group of MCR is coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing tetrapyrrole derivative. Additionally, a few modified versions of F430 have been discovered, including the 172-methylthio-F430 (mt-F430) that functions with ANME-1 MCR. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to unravel the intricacies of the active-site dynamics of MCR from Methanosarcina acetivorans and ANME-1 when bound to the canonical F430 compared to 172-thioether coenzyme F430 variants and substrates for methane formation. Overall, our simulations indicate that each MCR active site is optimized for a given version of F430 and support the importance of the Gln to Val substitution in accommodating the 172 methylthio modification. Notably, modifications in the 172 position disrupt the canonical coordination among cofactors in M. acetivorans MCR, implicating structural perturbations, but evidence of active site reorganization to maintain substrate positions suggest that the modified F430s could be accommodated in a methanogenic MCR. We additionally report the first quantitative estimate of MCR intrinsic electric fields pivotal in driving methane formation. Our results suggest that the electric field aligned along the CH3-S-CoM thioether bond facilitates homolytic bond cleavage, coinciding with the proposed catalytic mechanism. Structural perturbations, however, weaken and misalign these electric fields, emphasizing the significance of the active site structure in maintaining their integrity. In conclusion, our results deepen the understanding of MCR active-site dynamics, the enzymes organizational role in intrinsic electric fields for catalysis, and the interplay between active site structure and electrostatics. This work not only advances our comprehension of MCR functionality but also provides a foundation for future investigations employing sophisticated models to capture the complex electronic properties of MCR active sites quantitatively.</p>
