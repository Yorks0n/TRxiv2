S.; Duss, O.\nScore: 99.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570708\nA central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment and can be physically and functionally coupled. While several recently published high-resolution structures of the ribosome-RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex provided first mechanistic insight into the coupling process, we do not know how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here, we reconstitute a complete active transcription-translation system and develop multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real-time. Our data show that the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP and that coupling following a collision becomes less efficient. Unexpectedly, physical coupling can occur with hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA between both machineries by mRNA looping, and increases in efficiency in presence of NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. We provide an alternative explanation on how the ribosome can rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Our data mechanistically highlight an example of how macromolecular machines central to gene expression physically and functionally cooperate.\nSmart Parallel Automated Cryo Electron tomography\nAuthors: Eisenstein, F.; Fukuda, Y.; Danev, R.\nScore: 32.6, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.571776\nIn situ cryo electron tomography enables investigation of macromolecules in their native cellular environment. Data collection, however, requires an experienced operator and valuable microscope time to carefully select targets for tilt series acquisition. Here, we developed a workflow using machine learning approaches to fully automate the entire process, including lamella detection, biological feature segmentation, target selection, and tilt series acquisition, all without the need for human intervention.\nActive membrane deformations of a minimal synthetic cell\nAuthors: Sciortino, A.; Faizi, H.; Uplap, S.; Frechette, L.; Peterson, M. S.; Vlahovska, P.; Baskaran, A.; Hagan, M. F.; Bausch, A.\nScore: 27.8, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.571643\nBiological cells exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt their shape in response to their environment, a phenomenon that hinges on the intricate interplay between their deformable membrane and the underlying activity of their cytoskeleton. Yet, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain mostly elusive. Here, we introduce a synthetic cell model, comprised of an active cytoskeletal network of microtubules, crosslinkers and molecular motors encapsulated inside giant vesicles. Remarkably, these active vesicles exhibit large shape fluctuations and life-like morphing abilities. Active forces from the encapsulated cytoskeleton give rise to large-scale traveling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule fluctuations shows how the intricate coupling of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces yields fluctuation spectra whose characteristic scales in space and time are distinctly different from passive vesicles. We demonstrate how activity leads to uneven probability fluxes between fluctuation modes and hence sets the temporal scale of membrane fluctuations. Using simulations and theoretical modelling, we extend the classical approach to membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, highlighting the effect of correlated activity on the dynamics of membrane deformations and paving the way for quantitative descriptions of the shape-morphing ability typical of living systems.\nPlant infection by the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis requires actin-dependent generation of high invasive turgor pressure\nAuthors: Mueller, T.; Bronkhorst, J.; Mueller, J.; Safari, N.; Hahn, M.; Sprakel, J.; Scheuring, D.\nScore: 20.4, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571920\nThe devastating pathogen Botrytis cinerea infects a broad spectrum of host plants, causing great socio-economic losses. The necrotrophic fungus rapidly kills plant cells, nourishing their walls and cellular contents. To this end, necrotrophs secretes a cocktail of cell wall degrading enzymes, phytotoxic proteins and metabolites. Additionally, many fungi produce specialized invasion organs that generate high invasive pressures to force their way into the plant cell. However, for most necrotrophs, including Botrytis, the biomechanics of penetration and its contribution to virulence are poorly understood. Here we use a combination of quantitative micromechanical imaging and CRISPR-Cas guided mutagenesis to show that Botrytis uses substantial invasive pressure, in combination with strong surface adherence, for penetration. We found that the fungus establishes a unique mechanical geometry of penetration that develops over time during penetration events, and which is actin cytoskeleton dependent. Furthermore, interference of force generation by blocking actin polymerization was found to decrease Botrytis virulence, indicating that also for necrotrophs, mechanical pressure is important in host colonization. Our results demonstrate for the first time mechanistically how a necrotrophic fungus such as Botrytis employs this \"brute force\" approach, in addition to the secretion of lytic proteins and phytotoxic metabolites, to overcome plant host resistance.\n3D Mitochondrial Structure in Aging Human Skeletal Muscle: Insights into MFN-2 Mediated Changes\nAuthors: Scudese, E.; Vue, Z.; Katti, P.; Marshall, A.; Vang, L.; Garza Lopez, E.; Neikirk, K.; Stephens, D.; Hall, D. D.; Rostami, R.; Shao, J.-q.; Mungai, M.; AshShareef, S.; Hicsasmaz, I.; Manus, S.; Whiteside, A.; Williams, C.; Damo, S.; Gaddy, J.; Kirabo, A.; Glancy, B.; Henrique Martin Dantas, E.; Kinder, A.; Scartoni, F.; Baffi, M.; McReynolds, M.; Wanjalla, C. N.; Phillips, M. A.; Exil, V.; Mobley, B.; Hinton, A.\nScore: 14.2, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.13.566502\nSarcopenia is an age-related loss of skeletal muscle, characterized by loss of mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity during aging. Notably, bioenergetics and protein turnover studies have shown that mitochondria mediate this decline in function. Although mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, the three-dimensional (3D) mitochondrial structure associated with morphological changes in skeletal muscle during aging still requires further elucidation. Although exercise has been the only therapy to mitigate sarcopenia, the mechanisms that govern these changes remain unclear. We hypothesized that aging causes structural remodeling of mitochondrial 3D architecture representative of dysfunction, and this effect is mitigated by exercise. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to image human skeletal tissue samples, followed by manual contour tracing using Amira software for 3D reconstruction and subsequent analysis of mitochondria. We then applied a rigorous in vitro and in vivo exercise regimen during aging. We found that mitochondria became less complex with age. Specifically, mitochondria lost surface area, complexity, and perimeter, indicating age-related declines in ATP synthesis and interaction capacity. Concomitantly, muscle area, exercise capacity, and mitochondrial dynamic proteins showed age-related losses. Exercise stimulation restored mitofusin 2 (MFN2), which we show is required for mitochondrial structure. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is evolutionarily conserved with Marf, the MFN2 ortholog in Drosophila, as Marf knockdown alters mitochondrial morphology and leads to the downregulation of genes regulating mitochondrial processes. Our results define age-related structural changes in mitochondria and further suggest that exercise may mitigate age-related structural decline through modulation of mitofusins.\nUncovering kinesin dynamics in neurites with MINFLUX\nAuthors: Wirth, J. O.; Schentarra, E. M.; Scheiderer, L.; Palacios, V. M.; Tarnawski, M.; Hell, S. W.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-12-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.571866\nNeurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly observed on microtubules polymerized on glass coverslips. A gentle fixation protocol largely maintains the structure and surface modifications of the microtubules in the cell. By analyzing the time between the substeps, we identify the ATP-binding state of kinesin-1 and observe the associated rotation of the kinesin-1 head in neurites. We also observed kinesin-1 switching microtubules mid-walk, highlighting the potential of MINFLUX to study the details of active cellular transport.\nEnsemble-based design of tau to inhibit aggregation while preserving biological activity.\nAuthors: Bali, S.; Singh, R.; Wydorski, P. M.; Wosztyl, A.; Perez, V. A.; chen, d.; Rizo, J.; Joachimiak, L. A.\nScore: 10.4, Published: 2023-12-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.571598\nThe microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by amyloid formation. Mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia increase tau aggregation propensity and disrupt its endogenous microtubule-binding activity. The structural relationship between aggregation propensity and biological activity remains unclear. We employed a multi-disciplinary approach, including computational modeling, NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and cell models to design tau sequences that stabilize its structural ensemble. Our findings reveal that substitutions near the conserved PGGG beta-turn motif can modulate local conformation, more stably engaging in interactions with the 306VQIVYK311 amyloid motif to decrease aggregation in vitro and in cells. Designed tau sequences maintain microtubule binding and explain why 3R isoforms of tau exhibit reduced pathogenesis over 4R isoforms. We propose a simple mechanism to reduce the formation of pathogenic species while preserving biological function, offering insights for therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases.\nLanthanide Cathodophores for Multicolor Electron Microscopy\nAuthors: Abdul Rehman, S.; Conway, J. B.; Nichols, A.; Soucy, E. R.; Dee, A.; Stevens, K.; Merminod, S.; MacNaughton, I.; Curtis, A.; Prigozhin, M. B.\nScore: 11.0, Published: 2023-12-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.570835\nElectron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence imaging are indispensable techniques that provide complementary information on cellular organization. Combining these two modalities is a long-standing challenge in bioimaging. In principle, it should be possible to use the electron beam both for ultrastructural imaging and for molecular localization. The latter could be accomplished by directly exciting suitable biomolecular labels and detecting their luminescence - a process termed cathodoluminescence (CL). Here, we achieve multicolor, single-particle CL imaging of sub-20-nm lanthanide nanocrystals (cathodophores) in the same field of view on the surface of a mammalian cell while simultaneously imaging cellular ultrastructure. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a comprehensive framework for single-particle CL imaging of lanthanide nanocrystals. By mitigating nonlocal excitation due to secondary electrons, we achieved single-particle detection of multiple spectrally distinct types of sub-20-nm cathodophores. The smallest detectable cathodophores were [~]15 nm in diameter. We found that the CL emission rate of single nanocrystals increased monotonically with lanthanide doping level and scaled linearly with nanocrystal diameter. Furthermore, even in the absence of inert shells, cathodophores were not quenched in the context of mammalian cells processed for EM imaging using heavy-metal staining and sputter-coating. These findings establish cathodophores as promising biomolecular tags for multicolor EM. Moreover, our results inform general design rules for precise control and rational engineering of future generations of single-particle cathodoluminescent nanoprobes.\nRASP: Optimal single fluorescent puncta detection in complex cellular backgrounds\nAuthors: Fu, B.; Brock, E. E.; Andrews, R.; Breiter, J. C.; Tian, R.; Toomey, C. E.; Lachica, J.; Lashley, T.; Ryten, M.; Wood, N. W.; Vendruscolo, M.; Gandhi, S.; Weiss, L. E.; Beckwith, J. S.; Lee, S. F.\nScore: 6.6, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572148\nSuper-resolution and single-molecule microscopy are increasingly applied to complex biological systems. A major challenge of this approach is that fluorescent puncta must be detected in the low signal, high noise, heterogeneous background environments of cells and tissue. We present RASP, Radiality Analysis of Single Puncta, a bioimaging-segmentation method that solves this problem. RASP removes false positive puncta that other analysis methods detect, and detects features over a broad range of spatial scales: from single proteins to complex cell phenotypes. RASP outperforms the state-of-the-art in precision and speed, using image gradients to separate Gaussian-shaped objects from background. We demonstrate RASP's power by showing it can extract spatial correlations between microglia, neurons, and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the human brain. This sensitive, computationally efficient approach enables fluorescent puncta and cellular features to be distinguished in cellular and tissue environments with a sensitivity down to the level of the single protein.\nCan calmodulin bind to lipids of the cytosolic leaflet of plasma membranes?\nAuthors: Scollo, F.; Tempra, C.; Evci, H.; Riopedre-Fernandez, M.; Olzynska, A.; Javanainen, M.; Uday, A.; Cebecauer, M.; Cwiklik, L.; Martinez-Seara, H.; Jungwirth, P.; Jurkiewicz, P.; Hof, M.\nScore: 6.1, Published: 2023-12-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571079\nCalmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous calcium-sensitive messenger in eukaryotic cells. It was previously shown that CaM possesses an affinity for diverse lipid moieties, including those found on CaM-binding proteins. These facts together with our observation that CaM accumulates in membrane-rich protrusions of HeLa cells upon increased cytosolic calcium, motivated us to perform a systematic search for unmediated CaM interactions with model lipid membranes mimicking the cytosolic leaflet of plasma membranes. A range of experimental techniques and Molecular Dynamics simulations proves unambiguously that CaM interacts with lipid bilayers in the presence of calcium ions. Lipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) hold the key to CaM-membrane interactions. Calcium induces an essential conformational rearrangement of CaM, but its binding to the headgroup of PS also neutralizes the membrane negative surface charge. More intriguingly, PE plays a dual role - it forms hydrogen bonds with CaM, but also destabilizes the lipid bilayer to increase exposure of hydrophobic acyl chains to the interacting proteins. Our findings suggest that upon increased intracellular calcium concentration, CaM and the cytosolic leaflet of cellular membranes can be functionally connected.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment and can be physically and functionally coupled. While several recently published high-resolution structures of the ribosome-RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex provided first mechanistic insight into the coupling process, we do not know how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here, we reconstitute a complete active transcription-translation system and develop multi-color single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real-time. Our data show that the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP and that coupling following a collision becomes less efficient. Unexpectedly, physical coupling can occur with hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA between both machineries by mRNA looping, and increases in efficiency in presence of NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. We provide an alternative explanation on how the ribosome can rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Our data mechanistically highlight an example of how macromolecular machines central to gene expression physically and functionally cooperate.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Biological cells exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt their shape in response to their environment, a phenomenon that hinges on the intricate interplay between their deformable membrane and the underlying activity of their cytoskeleton. Yet, the precise physical mechanisms of this coupling remain mostly elusive. Here, we introduce a synthetic cell model, comprised of an active cytoskeletal network of microtubules, crosslinkers and molecular motors encapsulated inside giant vesicles. Remarkably, these active vesicles exhibit large shape fluctuations and life-like morphing abilities. Active forces from the encapsulated cytoskeleton give rise to large-scale traveling membrane deformations. Quantitative analysis of membrane and microtubule fluctuations shows how the intricate coupling of confinement, membrane material properties and cytoskeletal forces yields fluctuation spectra whose characteristic scales in space and time are distinctly different from passive vesicles. We demonstrate how activity leads to uneven probability fluxes between fluctuation modes and hence sets the temporal scale of membrane fluctuations. Using simulations and theoretical modelling, we extend the classical approach to membrane fluctuations to active cytoskeleton-driven vesicles, highlighting the effect of correlated activity on the dynamics of membrane deformations and paving the way for quantitative descriptions of the shape-morphing ability typical of living systems.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The devastating pathogen Botrytis cinerea infects a broad spectrum of host plants, causing great socio-economic losses. The necrotrophic fungus rapidly kills plant cells, nourishing their walls and cellular contents. To this end, necrotrophs secretes a cocktail of cell wall degrading enzymes, phytotoxic proteins and metabolites. Additionally, many fungi produce specialized invasion organs that generate high invasive pressures to force their way into the plant cell. However, for most necrotrophs, including Botrytis, the biomechanics of penetration and its contribution to virulence are poorly understood. Here we use a combination of quantitative micromechanical imaging and CRISPR-Cas guided mutagenesis to show that Botrytis uses substantial invasive pressure, in combination with strong surface adherence, for penetration. We found that the fungus establishes a unique mechanical geometry of penetration that develops over time during penetration events, and which is actin cytoskeleton dependent. Furthermore, interference of force generation by blocking actin polymerization was found to decrease Botrytis virulence, indicating that also for necrotrophs, mechanical pressure is important in host colonization. Our results demonstrate for the first time mechanistically how a necrotrophic fungus such as Botrytis employs this &#34;brute force&#34; approach, in addition to the secretion of lytic proteins and phytotoxic metabolites, to overcome plant host resistance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Sarcopenia is an age-related loss of skeletal muscle, characterized by loss of mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity during aging. Notably, bioenergetics and protein turnover studies have shown that mitochondria mediate this decline in function. Although mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, the three-dimensional (3D) mitochondrial structure associated with morphological changes in skeletal muscle during aging still requires further elucidation. Although exercise has been the only therapy to mitigate sarcopenia, the mechanisms that govern these changes remain unclear. We hypothesized that aging causes structural remodeling of mitochondrial 3D architecture representative of dysfunction, and this effect is mitigated by exercise. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to image human skeletal tissue samples, followed by manual contour tracing using Amira software for 3D reconstruction and subsequent analysis of mitochondria. We then applied a rigorous in vitro and in vivo exercise regimen during aging. We found that mitochondria became less complex with age. Specifically, mitochondria lost surface area, complexity, and perimeter, indicating age-related declines in ATP synthesis and interaction capacity. Concomitantly, muscle area, exercise capacity, and mitochondrial dynamic proteins showed age-related losses. Exercise stimulation restored mitofusin 2 (MFN2), which we show is required for mitochondrial structure. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is evolutionarily conserved with Marf, the MFN2 ortholog in Drosophila, as Marf knockdown alters mitochondrial morphology and leads to the downregulation of genes regulating mitochondrial processes. Our results define age-related structural changes in mitochondria and further suggest that exercise may mitigate age-related structural decline through modulation of mitofusins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly observed on microtubules polymerized on glass coverslips. A gentle fixation protocol largely maintains the structure and surface modifications of the microtubules in the cell. By analyzing the time between the substeps, we identify the ATP-binding state of kinesin-1 and observe the associated rotation of the kinesin-1 head in neurites. We also observed kinesin-1 switching microtubules mid-walk, highlighting the potential of MINFLUX to study the details of active cellular transport.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by amyloid formation. Mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia increase tau aggregation propensity and disrupt its endogenous microtubule-binding activity. The structural relationship between aggregation propensity and biological activity remains unclear. We employed a multi-disciplinary approach, including computational modeling, NMR, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and cell models to design tau sequences that stabilize its structural ensemble. Our findings reveal that substitutions near the conserved  PGGG beta-turn motif can modulate local conformation, more stably engaging in interactions with the 306VQIVYK311 amyloid motif to decrease aggregation in vitro and in cells. Designed tau sequences maintain microtubule binding and explain why 3R isoforms of tau exhibit reduced pathogenesis over 4R isoforms. We propose a simple mechanism to reduce the formation of pathogenic species while preserving biological function, offering insights for therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing protein misfolding in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Electron microscopy (EM) and fluorescence imaging are indispensable techniques that provide complementary information on cellular organization. Combining these two modalities is a long-standing challenge in bioimaging. In principle, it should be possible to use the electron beam both for ultrastructural imaging and for molecular localization. The latter could be accomplished by directly exciting suitable biomolecular labels and detecting their luminescence - a process termed cathodoluminescence (CL). Here, we achieve multicolor, single-particle CL imaging of sub-20-nm lanthanide nanocrystals (cathodophores) in the same field of view on the surface of a mammalian cell while simultaneously imaging cellular ultrastructure. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a comprehensive framework for single-particle CL imaging of lanthanide nanocrystals. By mitigating nonlocal excitation due to secondary electrons, we achieved single-particle detection of multiple spectrally distinct types of sub-20-nm cathodophores. The smallest detectable cathodophores were [~]15 nm in diameter. We found that the CL emission rate of single nanocrystals increased monotonically with lanthanide doping level and scaled linearly with nanocrystal diameter. Furthermore, even in the absence of inert shells, cathodophores were not quenched in the context of mammalian cells processed for EM imaging using heavy-metal staining and sputter-coating. These findings establish cathodophores as promising biomolecular tags for multicolor EM. Moreover, our results inform general design rules for precise control and rational engineering of future generations of single-particle cathodoluminescent nanoprobes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Super-resolution and single-molecule microscopy are increasingly applied to complex biological systems. A major challenge of this approach is that fluorescent puncta must be detected in the low signal, high noise, heterogeneous background environments of cells and tissue. We present RASP, Radiality Analysis of Single Puncta, a bioimaging-segmentation method that solves this problem. RASP removes false positive puncta that other analysis methods detect, and detects features over a broad range of spatial scales: from single proteins to complex cell phenotypes. RASP outperforms the state-of-the-art in precision and speed, using image gradients to separate Gaussian-shaped objects from background. We demonstrate RASP&#39;s power by showing it can extract spatial correlations between microglia, neurons, and alpha-synuclein oligomers in the human brain. This sensitive, computationally efficient approach enables fluorescent puncta and cellular features to be distinguished in cellular and tissue environments with a sensitivity down to the level of the single protein.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous calcium-sensitive messenger in eukaryotic cells. It was previously shown that CaM possesses an affinity for diverse lipid moieties, including those found on CaM-binding proteins. These facts together with our observation that CaM accumulates in membrane-rich protrusions of HeLa cells upon increased cytosolic calcium, motivated us to perform a systematic search for unmediated CaM interactions with model lipid membranes mimicking the cytosolic leaflet of plasma membranes. A range of experimental techniques and Molecular Dynamics simulations proves unambiguously that CaM interacts with lipid bilayers in the presence of calcium ions. Lipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) hold the key to CaM-membrane interactions. Calcium induces an essential conformational rearrangement of CaM, but its binding to the headgroup of PS also neutralizes the membrane negative surface charge. More intriguingly, PE plays a dual role - it forms hydrogen bonds with CaM, but also destabilizes the lipid bilayer to increase exposure of hydrophobic acyl chains to the interacting proteins. Our findings suggest that upon increased intracellular calcium concentration, CaM and the cytosolic leaflet of cellular membranes can be functionally connected.</p>
