While patient portals are generally seen as beneficial in engaging patients in health management, the link between their use and post-bariatric surgery weight loss remains unclear. ObjectiveThis study investigated the association between patient portal engagement and postoperative body mass index (BMI) reduction among bariatric surgery patients. MethodsThis retrospective longitudinal study included patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between January 2018 and March 2021. Using generalized estimating equations, we estimated the association between active days of postoperative patient portal use and the reduction of BMI percentage (%BMI) at 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Covariates included duration since surgery, the patients age at the time of surgery, gender, race and ethnicity, type of bariatric surgery, severity of comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic disadvantage. ResultsThe study included 1,415 patients, mostly female (80.9%), with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. 805 (56.9%) patients underwent RYGB and 610 (43.1%) underwent SG. By one-year post-surgery, the mean (SD) %BMI reduction was 31.1% (8.3%), and the mean (SD) number of patient portal active days was 61.0 (41.2). A significantly positive association was observed between patient portal engagement and %BMI reduction, with variations revealed over time. Each 10-day increment of active portal use was associated with a 0.57% ([95% CI: 0.42- 0.72], P \u003c .001) and 0.35% ([95% CI: 0.22- 0.49], P \u003c .001) %BMI reduction at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The association was not statistically significant at 12 months postoperatively ({beta}=-0.07, [95% CI: -0.24- 0.09], P = .54). Various portal functions, including messaging, visits, my record, medical tools, billing, resources, and others, were positively associated with %BMI reduction at 3- and 6-months follow-ups. ConclusionsGreater patient portal engagement, which may represent stronger adherence to postoperative instructions, better self-management of health, and enhanced communication with care teams, was associated with improved postoperative weight loss. Future investigations are needed to identify important portal features that contribute to the long-term success of weight loss management.\nImpact of Vaccination Rates and Gross Domestic Product on COVID-19 Pandemic Mortality Across United States\nAuthors: Matveeva, O.; Ogurtsov, A. Y.; Shabalina, S. A.\nScore: 2.2, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301582\nObjective: To investigate the relationship between vaccination rates and excess mortality during distinct waves of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific infections, while considering a state's GDP per capita. Methods: We ranked U.S. states by vaccination rates and GDP and employed the CDC's excess mortality model for regression and odds ratio analysis. Results: Regression analysis reveals that both vaccination and GDP are significant factors related to mortality when considering the entire U.S. population. Notably, in wealthier states (with GDP above $65,000), excess mortality is primarily driven by slow vaccination rates, while in less affluent states, low GDP plays a major role. Odds ratio analysis demonstrates an almost twofold increase in mortality linked to the Delta and Omicron BA.1 virus variants in states with the slowest vaccination rates compared to those with the fastest (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-1.9, p \u003c 0.01). However, this gap disappeared in the post-Omicron BA.1 period. Conclusion: The interplay between slow vaccination and low GDP per capita drives high mortality.\nPatient experiences of UK primary care online triage and consultation platforms during COVID-19: A systematic review\nAuthors: Roberts, C.; George, J.; Jenkins, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301062\nBackgroundOnline triage and consultation platforms are being increasingly used by healthcare providers in the UK for patient/clinician interactions. COVID-19 accelerated the shift towards the use of these platforms to maintain healthcare provision and reduce transmission. Strict directives were introduced by the UK Government to avoid in-person contact wherever possible in March 2020. AimTo examine patients experiences of online triage and consultation in UK primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer considerations for their continued use. DesignThis study follows the PRISMA framework and includes qualitative studies conducted in UK primary care based on the experiences of patient users of any such online platform during the period of March 2020 to April 2023. Studies were included using the PICO format. Three literature databases were searched for relevant studies: PubMed, Science Direct and EMBASE. CASP is used to assess data quality. Results540 studies were reviewed and reduced to 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study characteristics were identified as: year of study, study population, disease types/conditions, patient response themes and the studys data capture method. A thematic inductive approach identifies three overarching themes (Accessibility, Care delivery, System functionality) and 10 sub-themes (Affordability, IT literacy, Communication, Convenience, Care quality, Patient safety/privacy, Usability, Continuity of care, Inequality and Media influence). ConclusionThis review highlights aspects of patient satisfaction and benefit but also those most concerning for patients. This study reviews the rapid, compulsory adoption of these systems during COVID-19 with implications for their future implementation beyond the pandemic.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOnline triage and consultation platforms are being increasingly used by healthcare providers in the UK for patient/clinician interactions. COVID-19 accelerated the shift towards the use of these platforms to maintain healthcare provision and reduce transmission. Strict directives were introduced by the UK Government to avoid in-person contact wherever possible in March 2020.

AimTo examine patients experiences of online triage and consultation in UK primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer considerations for their continued use.

DesignThis study follows the PRISMA framework and includes qualitative studies conducted in UK primary care based on the experiences of patient users of any such online platform during the period of March 2020 to April 2023. Studies were included using the PICO format. Three literature databases were searched for relevant studies: PubMed, Science Direct and EMBASE. CASP is used to assess data quality.

Results540 studies were reviewed and reduced to 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study characteristics were identified as: year of study, study population, disease types/conditions, patient response themes and the studys data capture method. A thematic inductive approach identifies three overarching themes (Accessibility, Care delivery, System functionality) and 10 sub-themes (Affordability, IT literacy, Communication, Convenience, Care quality, Patient safety/privacy, Usability, Continuity of care, Inequality and Media influence).

ConclusionThis review highlights aspects of patient satisfaction and benefit but also those most concerning for patients. This study reviews the rapid, compulsory adoption of these systems during COVID-19 with implications for their future implementation beyond the pandemic.</p>
