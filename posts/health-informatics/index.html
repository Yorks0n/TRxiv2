I have also used TensorFlow.js from Google to create a diabetes detection model. All those models are integrated into a chatbot, that according to the message entered by a user, is able to use the models intelligently.

However, the interpretation of test results can be subjective and prone to error. We describe an automated image analysis pipeline to accurately classify test types and results without human intervention using a dataset of 51,274 rapid antigen test images across three distinct test card brands. MethodsThe proposed method classifies participant-submitted images into four categories: positive for SARS-CoV-2, negative for SARS-CoV-2, invalid/uncertain, and unclassifiable. The model includes four stages: test card classification and region of interest detection using image-matching algorithms, elimination of invalid results using a developed Siamese neural network, and test result classification using transfer learning. ResultsThe model accuracy was very good for test-card classification (100%), region of interest detection (83.5%), and identification of invalid results ranging from 95.6% to 100% for different test types. Performance of the model for test result classification varied by tests; the models sensitivity, specificity, and precision for Abbott BinaxNOW was 0.761, 0.989, and 0.946, BD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 Test was 0.955, 0.993, and 0.877, and for QuickVue(R) At-Home OTC COVID-19 Test was 0.816, 0.988, and 0.930. ConclusionThe proposed method improved the interpretation of rapid antigen tests, particularly in invalid result detection compared to human-read, and offers a great opportunity for standardization of rapid antigen test interpretation and for providing feedback to participants with invalid tests.\nCharacterising and differentiating cognitive and motor speed in older adults:a longitudinal birth cohort study\nAuthors: Bundil, I.; Baltruschat, S.; Zhang, J.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-05 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.04.24300822\nObjectives. Information processing speed (IPS) has been proposed to be a key component in healthy ageing and cognitive functioning. Yet, current studies lack a consistent definition and specific influential characteristics. This study aimed at investigating IPS as a multifaceted concept by differentiating cognitive and motor IPS. Design, setting and participants. A retrospective data analysis using data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (MRC NSHD; a population-based cohort of UK adults born in 1946) at childhood (ages 8, 11, and 15) and adulthood (ages 60-64 and 68-70). Using structural equation modelling, we constructed two models of IPS with 2124 and 1176 participants, respectively. Outcome measures. Measures of interest included IPS (i.e., letter cancellation, simple and choice reaction time), intelligence (i.e., childhood intelligence and NART), verbal memory, socio-economic status (SES) and cognitive functions measured by the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination III, as well as a variety of health indexes. Results. We found distinct predictors for cognitive and motor IPS and how they relate to other cognitive functions in old age. In our first model, SES and anti-psychotic medication usage emerged as significant predictors for cognitive IPS, intelligence and smoking as predictors for motor IPS, while both share sex, memory, and anti-epileptic medication usage as common predictors. Notably, all differences between both IPS types ran in the same direction except for sex differences, with women performing better than men in cognitive IPS and vice versa in motor IPS. The second model showed that both IPS measures, as well as intelligence, memory, anti-psychotic and sedative medication usage explain cognitive functions later in life. Conclusion. Taken together, these results shed further light on IPS as a whole by showing there are distinct types and that these measures directly relate to other cognitive functions.\nA web tool for the exploration of hospital prescription data in England\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299817\nMedicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Objectives. Information processing speed (IPS) has been proposed to be a key component in healthy ageing and cognitive functioning. Yet, current studies lack a consistent definition and specific influential characteristics. This study aimed at investigating IPS as a multifaceted concept by differentiating cognitive and motor IPS. Design, setting and participants. A retrospective data analysis using data from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (MRC NSHD; a population-based cohort of UK adults born in 1946) at childhood (ages 8, 11, and 15) and adulthood (ages 60-64 and 68-70). Using structural equation modelling, we constructed two models of IPS with 2124 and 1176 participants, respectively. Outcome measures. Measures of interest included IPS (i.e., letter cancellation, simple and choice reaction time), intelligence (i.e., childhood intelligence and NART), verbal memory, socio-economic status (SES) and cognitive functions measured by the Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination III, as well as a variety of health indexes. Results. We found distinct predictors for cognitive and motor IPS and how they relate to other cognitive functions in old age. In our first model, SES and anti-psychotic medication usage emerged as significant predictors for cognitive IPS, intelligence and smoking as predictors for motor IPS, while both share sex, memory, and anti-epileptic medication usage as common predictors. Notably, all differences between both IPS types ran in the same direction except for sex differences, with women performing better than men in cognitive IPS and vice versa in motor IPS. The second model showed that both IPS measures, as well as intelligence, memory, anti-psychotic and sedative medication usage explain cognitive functions later in life. Conclusion. Taken together, these results shed further light on IPS as a whole by showing there are distinct types and that these measures directly relate to other cognitive functions.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.</p>
