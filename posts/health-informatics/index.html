Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.\nRobodoc: a conversational-AI based app for medical conversations\nAuthors: Pires, J. G.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2024-01-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.31.23300681\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) evolved in trends. Currently, the trend is Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI). Those models of AI are focused on text-related tasks, and their commonest applications are chatbots. On this paper, we explore a smart chatbot using the Large Language Models (LLMs) from openAI. I have used a tool called Teachable Machine (TM) from Google to apply transfer learning and create image-based models. I have built two image-based model: for X-ray and for OCT. The model of X-ray is able to detect viral and bacterial pneumonia, whereas the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) model can detect Drusen, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and (Diabetic Macular Edema DME) conditions on the patient's eyes image. I have also used TensorFlow.js from Google to create a diabetes detection model. All those models are integrated into a chatbot, that according to the message entered by a user, is able to use the models intelligently. Our results show a good integration between the models and the chatbot, with slight deviations from the expected behaviors. For the OCT model, we have also tested a stub function for medical appointments done by the bot, based on how serious is the patient condition. The future of artificial intelligence are public APIs, as I have shown that a complex model can be built, without a complex research infrastructure, and with low costs. Bioinformatics may have gained a new supporter towards more friendly interfaces on bioinformatics.\nA web tool for the exploration of hospital prescription data in England\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.\nScore: 16.8, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299817\nMedicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.\nEmpowering Transformers for Evidence-Based Medicine\nAuthors: Mohammed, S.; Fiaidhi, J.; Shaik, H.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-12-28 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.25.23300520\nBreaking the barrier for practicing evidence-based medicine rely on effective methods for rapidly identifying relevant evidences from the body of biomedical literature. An important challenge confronted by the medical practitioners is the long time needed to browse, filter, summarize and compile information from different medical resources. Deep learning can help in solving this based on the automatic question answering (Q\u0026A) and transformers. However, Q\u0026A and transformers technologies are not trained to answer clinical queries that can be used for evidence-based practice nor it can respond to structured clinical questioning protocol like PICO (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome). This article describes the use of deep learning techniques for Q\u0026A that is based on transformer models like BERT and GPT to answer PICO clinical questions that can be used for evidence-based practice extracted from sound medical research resources like PubMed. We are reporting acceptable clinical answers that are supported by findings from PubMed. Our transformer methods are reaching an acceptable state of the art performance based on two staged bootstrapping process involving filtering relevant articles followed by identifying articles that support the requested outcome expressed by the PICO question. Moreover, we are also reporting experimentations to empower our bootstrapping techniques with patch attentions to the most important keywords in the clinical case and the PICO questions. Our bootstrapped patched with attention is showing relevancy of the evidences collected based on an entropy metrics.\nAnalysis of Pleiotropy for Testosterone and Lipid Profiles in Males and Females\nAuthors: Chattopadhyay, S.; Bhattacharyya, S.; Basu, S.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.27.23300595\nIn modern scientific studies, it is often imperative to determine whether a set of phenotypes is affected by a single factor. If such an influence is identified, it becomes essential to discern whether this effect is contingent upon categories such as sex or age group, and importantly, to understand whether this dependence is rooted in purely non-environmental reasons. The exploration of such dependencies often involves studying pleiotropy, a phenomenon wherein a single genetic locus impacts multiple traits. This heightened interest in uncovering dependencies by pleiotropy is fueled by the growing accessibility of summary statistics from genomewide association studies (GWAS) and the establishment of thoroughly phenotyped sample collections. This advancement enables a systematic and comprehensive exploration of the genetic connections among various traits and diseases. additive genetic correlation illuminates the genetic connection between two traits, providing valuable insights into the shared biological pathways and underlying causal relationships between them. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze such dependencies by studying additive genetic correlations between pairs of traits under consideration. Subsequently, we employ matrix comparison techniques to discern and elucidate sex-specific or age-group-specific associations, contributing to a deeper understanding of the nuanced dependencies within the studied traits. Our proposed method is computationally handy and requires only GWAS summary statistics. We validate our method by applying it to the UK Biobank data and present the results.\nHumanELY: Human evaluation of LLM yield, using a novel web-based evaluation tool\nAuthors: Awasthi, R.; Mishra, S.; Mahapatra, D.; Khanna, A.; Maheshwari, K.; Cywinski, J.; Papay, F.; Mathur, P.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2023-12-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.23300458\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge language models (LLMs) have caught the imagination of researchers,developers and public in general the world over with their potential for transformation. Vast amounts of research and development resources are being provided to implement these models in all facets of life. Trained using billions of parameters, various measures of their accuracy and performance have been proposed and used in recent times. While many of the automated natural language assessment parameters measure LLM output performance for use of language, contextual outputs are still hard to measure and quantify. Hence, human evaluation is still an important measure of LLM performance,even though it has been applied variably and inconsistently due to lack of guidance and resource limitations. To provide a structured way to perform comprehensive human evaluation of LLM output, we propose the first guidance and tool called HumanELY. Our approach and tool built using prior knowledge helps perform evaluation of LLM outputs in a comprehensive, consistent, measurable and comparable manner. HumanELY comprises of five key evaluation metrics: relevance, coverage, coherence, harm and comparison. Additional submetrics within these five key metrics provide for Likert scale based human evaluation of LLM outputs. Our related webtool uses this HumanELY guidance to enable LLM evaluation and provide data for comparison against different users performing human evaluation. While all metrics may not be relevant and pertinent to all outputs, it is important to assess and address their use. Lastly, we demonstrate comparison of metrics used in HumanELY against some of the recent publications in the healthcare domain. We focused on the healthcare domain due to the need to demonstrate highest levels of accuracy and lowest levels of harm in a comprehensive manner. We anticipate our guidance and tool to be used for any domain where LLMs find an use case. Link to the HumanELY Toolhttps://www.brainxai.com/humanely\n",

        <p class="abstract">Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolved in trends. Currently, the trend is Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI). Those models of AI are focused on text-related tasks, and their commonest applications are chatbots. On this paper, we explore a smart chatbot using the Large Language Models (LLMs) from openAI. I have used a tool called Teachable Machine (TM) from Google to apply transfer learning and create image-based models. I have built two image-based model: for X-ray and for OCT. The model of X-ray is able to detect viral and bacterial pneumonia, whereas the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) model can detect Drusen, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and (Diabetic Macular Edema DME) conditions on the patient&#39;s eyes image. I have also used TensorFlow.js from Google to create a diabetes detection model. All those models are integrated into a chatbot, that according to the message entered by a user, is able to use the models intelligently. Our results show a good integration between the models and the chatbot, with slight deviations from the expected behaviors. For the OCT model, we have also tested a stub function for medical appointments done by the bot, based on how serious is the patient condition. The future of artificial intelligence are public APIs, as I have shown that a complex model can be built, without a complex research infrastructure, and with low costs. Bioinformatics may have gained a new supporter towards more friendly interfaces on bioinformatics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Breaking the barrier for practicing evidence-based medicine rely on effective methods for rapidly identifying relevant evidences from the body of biomedical literature. An important challenge confronted by the medical practitioners is the long time needed to browse, filter, summarize and compile information from different medical resources. Deep learning can help in solving this based on the automatic question answering (Q&amp;A) and transformers. However, Q&amp;A and transformers technologies are not trained to answer clinical queries that can be used for evidence-based practice nor it can respond to structured clinical questioning protocol like PICO (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome). This article describes the use of deep learning techniques for Q&amp;A that is based on transformer models like BERT and GPT to answer PICO clinical questions that can be used for evidence-based practice extracted from sound medical research resources like PubMed. We are reporting acceptable clinical answers that are supported by findings from PubMed. Our transformer methods are reaching an acceptable state of the art performance based on two staged bootstrapping process involving filtering relevant articles followed by identifying articles that support the requested outcome expressed by the PICO question. Moreover, we are also reporting experimentations to empower our bootstrapping techniques with patch attentions to the most important keywords in the clinical case and the PICO questions. Our bootstrapped patched with attention is showing relevancy of the evidences collected based on an entropy metrics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">In modern scientific studies, it is often imperative to determine whether a set of phenotypes is affected by a single factor. If such an influence is identified, it becomes essential to discern whether this effect is contingent upon categories such as sex or age group, and importantly, to understand whether this dependence is rooted in purely non-environmental reasons. The exploration of such dependencies often involves studying pleiotropy, a phenomenon wherein a single genetic locus impacts multiple traits. This heightened interest in uncovering dependencies by pleiotropy is fueled by the growing accessibility of summary statistics from genomewide association studies (GWAS) and the establishment of thoroughly phenotyped sample collections. This advancement enables a systematic and comprehensive exploration of the genetic connections among various traits and diseases. additive genetic correlation illuminates the genetic connection between two traits, providing valuable insights into the shared biological pathways and underlying causal relationships between them. In this paper, we present a novel method to analyze such dependencies by studying additive genetic correlations between pairs of traits under consideration. Subsequently, we employ matrix comparison techniques to discern and elucidate sex-specific or age-group-specific associations, contributing to a deeper understanding of the nuanced dependencies within the studied traits. Our proposed method is computationally handy and requires only GWAS summary statistics. We validate our method by applying it to the UK Biobank data and present the results.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge language models (LLMs) have caught the imagination of researchers,developers and public in general the world over with their potential for transformation. Vast amounts of research and development resources are being provided to implement these models in all facets of life. Trained using billions of parameters, various measures of their accuracy and performance have been proposed and used in recent times. While many of the automated natural language assessment parameters measure LLM output performance for use of language, contextual outputs are still hard to measure and quantify. Hence, human evaluation is still an important measure of LLM performance,even though it has been applied variably and inconsistently due to lack of guidance and resource limitations.

To provide a structured way to perform comprehensive human evaluation of LLM output, we propose the first guidance and tool called HumanELY. Our approach and tool built using prior knowledge helps perform evaluation of LLM outputs in a comprehensive, consistent, measurable and comparable manner. HumanELY comprises of five key evaluation metrics: relevance, coverage, coherence, harm and comparison. Additional submetrics within these five key metrics provide for Likert scale based human evaluation of LLM outputs. Our related webtool uses this HumanELY guidance to enable LLM evaluation and provide data for comparison against different users performing human evaluation. While all metrics may not be relevant and pertinent to all outputs, it is important to assess and address their use.

Lastly, we demonstrate comparison of metrics used in HumanELY against some of the recent publications in the healthcare domain. We focused on the healthcare domain due to the need to demonstrate highest levels of accuracy and lowest levels of harm in a comprehensive manner. We anticipate our guidance and tool to be used for any domain where LLMs find an use case.
