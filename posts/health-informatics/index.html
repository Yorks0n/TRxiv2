Physists may help with theory, such as for nuclear medicine. Engineers with machineries, such as dialysis machine. Mathematicians with models, such as pharmacokinetics. And computer scientists with codes such as bioinformatics. MethodWe have used TensorFlow.js for modeling using neural networks biomedical datasets from Kaggle. We have modeled three datasets: diabetes detection, surgery complications, and heart failure. We have used Angular coded in TypeScript for the implementation of the models. Using TensorFlow.js, we have built Multilayer Perceptrons (MPLs) for modelling our datasets. We have employed the training and the validation curves to make sure the model learnt, and we have used accuracy as a measure of goodness of each model. Results and discussionWe have built a couple of examples using TensorFlow.js as machine learning platform. Even though python and R are dominant at the moment, JavaScript and derivatives are growing fast, offering basically the same performance, and some extra features associated with JavaScript. Kaggle, the public platform from where we downloaded our datasets, offers a huge amount of datasets for biomedical cases, thus, the reader can easily test what we have discussed, using the same codes, with minor chances, on any case they may be interested in. We were able to find 92% of accuracy for diabetes detection, 100% for surgery complications, and 70% for heart failure. The possibilities are unlimited, and we believe that it is a nice option for researchers aiming at web applications, especially, focused on medicine.

However, it is unclear whether large linguistic models can rival specialized models by text alone. ObjectivesWe would explore the effectiveness of ChatGPT for primary screening of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and standardize the design steps and components of the prompt. MethodsWe obtained 174 participants from the DementiaBank screening and classified 70% of them into the training set and 30% into the test set. Three dimensions of variables were incorporated, including: vocabulary, syntax and grammar, and semantics. These variables were generated from published studies and statistical analyses. We used R 4.3.0. for the analysis of variables and diagnostic indicators. ResultsThe final variables included by published studies included: word frequency and word ratio, phrase frequency and phrase ratio, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity, grammatical components, semantic density, and semantic coherence; variables included in the analysis included: tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (P \u003c 0.001), difficulty with complex ideas (P \u003c 0.001), and memory issues (P \u003c 0.001). The final GPT4 model achieved the sensitivity (SEN) of 0.8636, specificity (SPE) of 0.9487 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9062 on the training set; on the test set, the SEN, SPE and AUC reached 0.7727, 0.8333 and 0.8030, respectively. The prompt consisted of five main parts, including character setting, scoring system setting, indicator setting, output setting, and explanatory information setting. ConclusionChatGPT was effective in primary screening of participants with possible MCI. Improved standardization of prompts by professional clinicians would also improve the performance of the model. It is important to note that ChatGPT is not a substitute for a clinician making a diagnosis.\n",
