MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of a multicenter hospital system in the United States. The electronic health record was queried from March 2020 to December 2021 for patients who presented to the emergency department who were subsequently COVID-positive. Associated patient demographics, vitals, and laboratory vitals were obtained. High-risk individuals were defined as those who required ICU admission or died; low-risk individuals did not meet those criteria. The dataset was split into a 3:1 training to testing dataset. A machine learning ensemble stack was built to predict ICU admission and mortality. ResultsOf the 3,142 hospital admissions with a COVID positive test, there were 1,128 (36%) individuals labeled as high-risk, and 2,014 (64%) as low-risk. We obtained 147 unique variables. CRP, LDH, procalcitonin, glucose, anion gap, creatinine, age, oxygen saturation, oxygen device, and obtainment of an ABG were chosen. Six machine learning models were then trained over model-specific hyperparameters, and then assessed on the testing dataset, generating an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.751, with a specificity of 95% in predicting high-risk individuals based on an initial emergency department assessment. ConclusionA novel machine learning model was generated to predict ICU admission and patient mortality from a multicenter hospital system and validated on unseen data.\nClinical trial and real-world data: A comparative study in patients with diabetic kidney disease\nAuthors: Kurki, S.; Halla-aho, V.; Haussmann, M.; Lahdesmaki, H.; Leinonen, J.; Koskinen, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-06-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.06.16.23291441\nObjectiveA growing body of research is focusing on clinical real-world data (RWD) to supplement or replace randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, due to the disparities in data generation mechanisms between RCTs and RWDs, differences are likely and necessitate scrutiny to validate the merging of these datasets. Materials and MethodsWe compared the temporal and completeness characteristics of pharmaceutical RCT data from 5,734 diabetic kidney disease patients with corresponding RWD from electronic health records (EHRs) of 23,523 patients. Demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory measurements, and vital signs were analyzed using visualization, descriptive statistics, statistical testing, and cluster analysis. ResultsRCT and RWD sets exhibited significant differences in prevalence, longitudinality, completeness, and sampling density. The cluster analysis revealed distinct patient subgroups within both RCT and RWD sets, as well as clusters containing patients from both sets. Discussion and ConclusionsThe results highlight the differences between RCT and RWD datasets, and their respective data generation mechanisms. Nonetheless, in certain instances, RWD has the potential to enrich RCT data. These discrepancies should be taken into account during the planning stages of an RCT-RWD study, and we stress the importance of validation to verify the feasibility of combining RCT and RWD. Moreover, advanced methods are needed to mitigate these differences, for instance, when building an external control arm.\n",
