While many studies have identified strong associations among specific SDoH and health outcomes, most people experience multiple SDoH that impact their daily lives. Analysis of this complexity requires the integration of personal, clinical, social, and environmental information from a large cohort of individuals that have been traditionally underrepresented in research, which is only recently being made available through the All of Us research program. However, little is known about the range and response of SDoH in All of Us, and how they co-occur to form subtypes, which are critical for designing targeted interventions. ObjectiveTo address two research questions: (1) What is the range and response to survey questions related to SDoH in the All of Us dataset? (2) How do SDoH co-occur to form subtypes, and what are their risk for adverse health outcomes? MethodsFor Question-1, an expert panel analyzed the range of SDoH questions across the surveys with respect to the 5 domains in Healthy People 2030 (HP-30), and analyzed their responses across the full All of Us data (n=372,397, V6). For Question-2, we used the following steps: (1) due to the missingness across the surveys, selected all participants with valid and complete SDoH data, and used inverse probability weighting to adjust their imbalance in demographics compared to the full data; (2) an expert panel grouped the SDoH questions into SDoH factors for enabling a more consistent granularity; (3) used bipartite modularity maximization to identify SDoH biclusters, their significance, and their replicability; (4) measured the association of each bicluster to three outcomes (depression, delayed medical care, emergency room visits in the last year) using multiple data types (surveys, electronic health records, and zip codes mapped to Medicaid expansion states); and (5) the expert panel inferred the subtype labels, potential mechanisms that precipitate adverse health outcomes, and interventions to prevent them. ResultsFor Question-1, we identified 110 SDoH questions across 4 surveys, which covered all 5 domains in HP-30. However, the results also revealed a large degree of missingness in survey responses (1.76%-84.56%), with later surveys having significantly fewer responses compared to earlier ones, and significant differences in race, ethnicity, and age of participants of those that completed the surveys with SDoH questions, compared to those in the full All of Us dataset. Furthermore, as the SDoH questions varied in granularity, they were categorized by an expert panel into 18 SDoH factors. For Question-2, the subtype analysis (n=12,913, d=18) identified 4 biclusters with significant biclusteredness (Q=0.13, random-Q=0.11, z=7.5, P\u003c0.001), and significant replication (Real-RI=0.88, Random-RI=0.62, P\u003c.001). Furthermore, there were statistically significant associations between specific subtypes and the outcomes, and with Medicaid expansion, each with meaningful interpretations and potential targeted interventions. For example, the subtype Socioeconomic Barriers included the SDoH factors not employed, food insecurity, housing insecurity, low income, low literacy, and low educational attainment, and had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR=4.2, CI=3.5-5.1, P-corr\u003c.001) for depression, when compared to the subtype Sociocultural Barriers. Individuals that match this subtype profile could be screened early for depression and referred to social services for addressing combinations of SDoH such as housing insecurity and low income. Finally, the identified subtypes spanned one or more HP-30 domains revealing the difference between the current knowledge-based SDoH domains, and the data-driven subtypes. ConclusionsThe results revealed that the SDoH subtypes not only had statistically significant clustering and replicability, but also had significant associations with critical adverse health outcomes, which had translational implications for designing targeted SDoH interventions, decision-support systems to alert clinicians of potential risks, and for public policies. Furthermore, these SDoH subtypes spanned multiple SDoH domains defined by HP-30 revealing the complexity of SDoH in the real-world, and aligning with influential SDoH conceptual models such as by Dahlgren-Whitehead. However, the high-degree of missingness warrants repeating the analysis as the data becomes more complete. Consequently we designed our machine learning code to be generalizable and scalable, and made it available on the All of Us workbench, which can be used to periodically rerun the analysis as the dataset grows for analyzing subtypes related to SDoH, and beyond.\nPatients Accessing their Online Records in England: A Survey of General Practitioners' Experiences and Opinions\nAuthors: Blease, C.; Kharko, A.; Dong, Z.; Jones, R.; Davidge, G.; Hagglund, M.; Turner, A.; DesRoches, C.; McMillan, B.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294326\nObjectiveTo describe the experiences and opinions of general practitioners (GPs) in England regarding patients having access to their full online GP health record. DesignConvenience sample, online survey. Participants400 registered GPs in England. Main outcome measuresInvestigators measured GPs experiences and opinions about online record access (ORA) including on patient care, and on their practice. ResultsA total of 400 GPs from all regions of England responded. A minority (130, 33%) believed ORA was a good idea. Most GPs believed a majority of patients would worry more (364, 91%) or find their GP records more confusing than helpful (338, 85%). In contrast, most GPs believed a majority of patients would find significant errors in their records (240, 60%), would better remember their care plan (280, 70%), and feel more in control of their care (243, 60%). The majority believed they will/already spend more time addressing patients questions outside of consultations (357, 89%), that consultations will/already take significantly longer (322, 81%), and reported they will be/already are less candid in their documentation (289, 72%) after ORA. Nearly two thirds of GPs believed ORA would increase their litigation (246, 62%). ConclusionsSimilar to clinicians in other countries, GPs in our sample were sceptical of ORA believing patients would worry more and find their records more confusing than helpful. Most GPs also believed the practice would exacerbate work burdens. However, the majority of GPs in this survey also agreed there were multiple benefits to patients having online access to their primary care health record.\nHarnessing the Open Access Version of ChatGPT for Enhanced Clinical Opinions\nAuthors: Tenner, Z. M.; Cottone, M.; Chavez, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294478\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the integration of AI into clinical medicine is becoming increasingly feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 to generate complex differential diagnoses, comparing its output to case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Forty case records were presented to ChatGPT-3.5, with prompts to provide a differential diagnosis and then narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis. Results indicated that the final diagnosis was included in ChatGPT-3.5s original differential list in 42.5% of the cases. After narrowing, ChatGPT correctly determined the final diagnosis in 27.5% of the cases, demonstrating a decrease in accuracy compared to previous studies using common chief complaints. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios, while highlighting the potential role of AI as an augmented clinical opinion. With anticipated growth and enhancements to AI tools like ChatGPT, physicians and other healthcare workers will likely find increasing support in generating differential diagnoses. However, continued exploration and regulation are essential to ensure the safe and effective integration of AI into healthcare practice. Future studies may seek to compare newer versions of ChatGPT or investigate patient outcomes with physician integration of this AI technology. By understanding and expanding AIs capabilities, particularly in differential diagnosis, the medical field may foster innovation and provide additional resources, especially in underserved areas.\nAI-Enhanced Integration of Genetic and Medical Imaging Data for Risk Assessment of Type 2 Diabetes\nAuthors: Huang, Y.-J.; Chen, C.-h.; Yang, H.-C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294093\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A.BackgroundSocial determinants of health (SDoH), such as financial resources and housing stability, account for between 30-55% of peoples health outcomes.

ResultsFor Question-1, we identified 110 SDoH questions across 4 surveys, which covered all 5 domains in HP-30. However, the results also revealed a large degree of missingness in survey responses (1.76%-84.56%), with later surveys having significantly fewer responses compared to earlier ones, and significant differences in race, ethnicity, and age of participants of those that completed the surveys with SDoH questions, compared to those in the full All of Us dataset. Furthermore, as the SDoH questions varied in granularity, they were categorized by an expert panel into 18 SDoH factors. For Question-2, the subtype analysis (n=12,913, d=18) identified 4 biclusters with significant biclusteredness (Q=0.13, random-Q=0.11, z=7.5, P&lt;0.001), and significant replication (Real-RI=0.88, Random-RI=0.62, P&lt;.001). Furthermore, there were statistically significant associations between specific subtypes and the outcomes, and with Medicaid expansion, each with meaningful interpretations and potential targeted interventions. For example, the subtype Socioeconomic Barriers included the SDoH factors not employed, food insecurity, housing insecurity, low income, low literacy, and low educational attainment, and had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR=4.2, CI=3.5-5.1, P-corr&lt;.001) for depression, when compared to the subtype Sociocultural Barriers. Individuals that match this subtype profile could be screened early for depression and referred to social services for addressing combinations of SDoH such as housing insecurity and low income. Finally, the identified subtypes spanned one or more HP-30 domains revealing the difference between the current knowledge-based SDoH domains, and the data-driven subtypes.

ConclusionsThe results revealed that the SDoH subtypes not only had statistically significant clustering and replicability, but also had significant associations with critical adverse health outcomes, which had translational implications for designing targeted SDoH interventions, decision-support systems to alert clinicians of potential risks, and for public policies. Furthermore, these SDoH subtypes spanned multiple SDoH domains defined by HP-30 revealing the complexity of SDoH in the real-world, and aligning with influential SDoH conceptual models such as by Dahlgren-Whitehead. However, the high-degree of missingness warrants repeating the analysis as the data becomes more complete. Consequently we designed our machine learning code to be generalizable and scalable, and made it available on the All of Us workbench, which can be used to periodically rerun the analysis as the dataset grows for analyzing subtypes related to SDoH, and beyond.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo describe the experiences and opinions of general practitioners (GPs) in England regarding patients having access to their full online GP health record.

DesignConvenience sample, online survey.

Participants400 registered GPs in England.

Main outcome measuresInvestigators measured GPs experiences and opinions about online record access (ORA) including on patient care, and on their practice.

ResultsA total of 400 GPs from all regions of England responded. A minority (130, 33%) believed ORA was a good idea. Most GPs believed a majority of patients would worry more (364, 91%) or find their GP records more confusing than helpful (338, 85%). In contrast, most GPs believed a majority of patients would find significant errors in their records (240, 60%), would better remember their care plan (280, 70%), and feel more in control of their care (243, 60%). The majority believed they will/already spend more time addressing patients questions outside of consultations (357, 89%), that consultations will/already take significantly longer (322, 81%), and reported they will be/already are less candid in their documentation (289, 72%) after ORA. Nearly two thirds of GPs believed ORA would increase their litigation (246, 62%).

ConclusionsSimilar to clinicians in other countries, GPs in our sample were sceptical of ORA believing patients would worry more and find their records more confusing than helpful. Most GPs also believed the practice would exacerbate work burdens. However, the majority of GPs in this survey also agreed there were multiple benefits to patients having online access to their primary care health record.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the integration of AI into clinical medicine is becoming increasingly feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 to generate complex differential diagnoses, comparing its output to case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Forty case records were presented to ChatGPT-3.5, with prompts to provide a differential diagnosis and then narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis. Results indicated that the final diagnosis was included in ChatGPT-3.5s original differential list in 42.5% of the cases. After narrowing, ChatGPT correctly determined the final diagnosis in 27.5% of the cases, demonstrating a decrease in accuracy compared to previous studies using common chief complaints. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios, while highlighting the potential role of AI as an augmented clinical opinion. With anticipated growth and enhancements to AI tools like ChatGPT, physicians and other healthcare workers will likely find increasing support in generating differential diagnoses. However, continued exploration and regulation are essential to ensure the safe and effective integration of AI into healthcare practice. Future studies may seek to compare newer versions of ChatGPT or investigate patient outcomes with physician integration of this AI technology. By understanding and expanding AIs capabilities, particularly in differential diagnosis, the medical field may foster innovation and provide additional resources, especially in underserved areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.</p>
