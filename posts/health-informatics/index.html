Precision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy.

M.; Braenne, I.; Whitehurst, C.; Schmitz, J.; de Jong, J.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301148\nPrecision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets has provided major opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning in mining such complex datasets for identifying novel disease subtypes. However, disease subtypes often exist in the context of certain disease-relevant risk events, and current efforts have been limited by analyzing clustering and event risk independently, resulting in subgroups that still display great heterogeneity in event risk and/or underlying molecular mechanisms. To address this problem, we developed TransVarSur (Transformer Variational Survival modeling). TransVarSur integrates a Transformer-based Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder with time-to-event modeling to capture complex relationships between cluster-specific EHR trajectories and survival times. We validated TransVarSur by showing superior performance relative to baseline methods, on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known ground-truth clustering. We then applied TransVarSur to 1908 Crohns disease patients from the UK Biobank and successfully identified four clusters displaying both divergent EHR trajectories and divergent progression towards the risk event intestinal obstruction. A further analysis of the clusters revealed known clinical and genetic factors relevant in Crohns disease and progression to intestinal obstruction. In conclusion, we demonstrated TransVarSurs ability to accurately stratify a patient population into clinically and genetically relevant, risk-associated subgroups. Hence, it can be a powerful tool in the development of precision medicine approaches.\nAn AI Method for Assessing Coding Consistency in a Large Dataset\nAuthors: Nelson, S. J.; Yiny, Y.; Shao, Y.; Ma, P.; Tuttle, M. S.; Zeng-Treitler, Q.\nScore: 0.5, Published: 2024-01-17 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.17.24301268\nObjectiveWe developed a method to assess the consistency of the assignment of ICD codes, using coding performed at a United States health system at the time of the transition from ICD-9CM to ICD-10CM. MethodsUsing clusters of equivalent codes derived from the US Centers for Disease Control General Equivalence Mapping (GEM) tables, ICD assignments occurring during the ICD-9CM to ICD-10CM transition were evaluated in EHR data from the US Veterans Administration Central Data Warehouse, using a deep learning model based on 860 covariates. The model was then used to detect abrupt changes across the transition; additionally changes at each VA station were examined. ResultsMany of the 687 most-used code clusters had ICD-10CM assignments differing greatly from that predicted by the GEM from the codes used in ICD-9CM. Notably, the observed transition patterns varied widely across care locations. ConclusionMachine learning can model variability across time and across location, enabling an assessment of coding consistency. Expert review is not scalable, deep learning model applied to a large dataset of EHR records provides an approximation of ground truth.\n",
