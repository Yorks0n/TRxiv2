N.; Shakeri, Z.; Ioannidis, J.; Topol, E.; Rajpurkar, P.\nScore: 70.0, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295381\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with numerous studies indicating its potential to perform as well or better than clinicians. However, a considerable portion of these AI models have only been tested retrospectively, raising concerns about their true effectiveness and potential risks in real-world clinical settings. MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving AI algorithms used in various clinical practice fields and locations, published between January 1, 2018, and August 18, 2023. Our study included 84 trials and focused specifically on evaluating intervention characteristics, study endpoints, and trial outcomes, including the potential of AI to improve care management, patient behavior and symptoms, and clinical decision-making. ResultsOur analysis revealed that 82{middle dot}1% (69/84) of trials reported positive results for their primary endpoint, highlighting AIs potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare. Trials predominantly evaluated deep learning systems for medical imaging and were conducted in single-center settings. The US and China had the most trials, with gastroenterology being the most common field of study. However, we also identified areas requiring further research, such as multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, to better understand AIs true impact and limitations in healthcare. ConclusionThe existing landscape of RCTs on AI in clinical practice demonstrates an expanding interest in applying AI across a range of fields and locations. While most trials report positive outcomes, more comprehensive research, including multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, is essential to fully understand AIs impact and limitations in healthcare.\nA Network Analysis of Molecular Interactions to Study the Development of New-onset Diabetes and Hypertension after COVID-19 Infection Using Bioinformatics Tools.\nAuthors: de Oliveira Andrade, L. J.; Matos de Oliveira, L. C.; Matos de Oliveira, G. C.; Matos de Oliveira, L.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2023-09-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.10.23295323\nIntroductionThe association between COVID-19 infection and the development of new-onset diabetes and hypertension is an emerging area of research. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Network analysis using bioinformatics tools can provide valuable insights into the complex molecular interactions involved in these conditions after COVID-19 infection. ObjectiveThis study aims to use bioinformatics tools to analyze the network of molecular interactions related to new-onset diabetes and hypertension following COVID-19 infection. MethodsData from publicly available databases were utilized, including gene expression profiles and protein-protein interaction information. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify genes that were differentially expressed in individuals with new-onset diabetes and hypertension after COVID-19 infection compared to healthy controls. A protein interaction network was constructed using bioinformatics tools to explore the functional relationships among the identified differentially expressed genes. ResultsThe network analysis revealed several key proteins and pathways related to the pathogenesis of new-onset diabetes and hypertension after COVID-19 infection. Notably, proteins involved in insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and blood pressure regulation were found to be prominently associated. The signaling pathway and the renin-angiotensin system were identified as key pathways in this context. ConclusionThis study provides insights by showing a network-based perspective on the molecular interactions involved in the development of new-onset diabetes and hypertension after COVID-19 infection.\nBuilding National Patient Registries in Mexico: Insights from the MexOMICS Consortium.\nAuthors: Reyes-Perez, P.; Hernandez-Ledesma, A. L.; Roman-Lopez, T. V.; Garcia-Vilchis, B.; Ramirez-Gonzalez, D.; Lazaro-Figueroa, A.; Martinez, D.; Flores-Ocampo, V.; Espinosa-Mendez, I. M.; Renteria, M. E.; Ruiz-Contreras, A. E.; Alcauter, S.; Medina-Rivera, A.\nScore: 7.2, Published: 2023-09-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.11.23295377\nOBJECTIVETo introduce MexOMICS, a Mexican Consortium focused on establishing electronic databases to collect, cross-reference, and share health-related and omics data on the Mexican population. METHODSThe Mexican Twin Registry (TwinsMX), Mexican Lupus Registry (LupusRGMX) and the Mexican Parkinsons Research Network (Mex-PD) were designed and implemented using Research Electronic Data Capture web-based application. Registries were compiled through voluntary participation and on-site engagement with medical specialists. In some instances, DNA samples and Magnetic Resonance Imaging images were also acquired. RESULTSSince 2019, the MexOMICS Consortium has successfully established three electronic-based registries: TwinsMX (n=2915), LupusRGMX (n=1761) and Mex-PD (n=750). In addition to sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical data, MexOMICS has collected samples for genetic determinations across the three registries. Cognitive function assessments, conducted using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, have been administered to a subsample of 376 Mex-PD participants. Furthermore, a subset of 267 twins underwent measurements of structural, functional, and spectroscopy brain images; comparable evaluations are projected for LupusRGMX and Mex-PD. CONCLUSIONSThe MexOMICS registries offer a valuable repository of information concerning the potential interplay of genetic and environmental factors in health conditions among the Mexican population.\nPERFECT: Personalized Exercise Recommendation Framework and architECTure\nAuthors: Asgari Mehrabadi, M.; Khatibi, E.; Jimah, T.; Labbaf, S.; Borg, H.; Pimentel, P.; Dutt, N.; Guo, Y.; Rahmani, A.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295561\nBackground: There are indisputable health benefits to physical activity (PA). By collecting and displaying individual exercise behaviors via wearable trackers, the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile health (mHealth) have made it possible to correlate users' physiological data and daily activity information with their fitness requirements. Objective: This study aimed to recommend personalized exercise to non-pregnant subjects to increase their physical activity level. Methods: We developed smartphone and smartwatch applications to collect, monitor, and recommend exercises using a contextual multi-arm bandit framework. Twenty female college students were recruited to test this mHealth exercise program. Results: Our findings indicated an increase in daily exercise duration (P \u003c .001), with average satisfaction scores for the walking and recommendation system components of 4.31 (0.60) and 3.69 (0.95), respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5. In addition, participants' confidence in their capacity to complete the suggested walking exercises safely and the study's ability to satisfy their needs for physical activity both received average scores of over 4. Conclusions: A new era of mHealth systems has been ushered in by developments in the Internet of Things and wearable devices. Personalization of physical activity recommendations using such wearables has the potential to improve user engagement and performance. In this paper, we presented an exercise recommendation system based on reinforcement learning that uses biomarkers and the user's context to recommend a unique walking exercise that enhances the user's aerobic capacity.\n",

        <p class="abstract">OBJECTIVETo introduce MexOMICS, a Mexican Consortium focused on establishing electronic databases to collect, cross-reference, and share health-related and omics data on the Mexican population.

METHODSThe Mexican Twin Registry (TwinsMX), Mexican Lupus Registry (LupusRGMX) and the Mexican Parkinsons Research Network (Mex-PD) were designed and implemented using Research Electronic Data Capture web-based application. Registries were compiled through voluntary participation and on-site engagement with medical specialists. In some instances, DNA samples and Magnetic Resonance Imaging images were also acquired.

RESULTSSince 2019, the MexOMICS Consortium has successfully established three electronic-based registries: TwinsMX (n=2915), LupusRGMX (n=1761) and Mex-PD (n=750). In addition to sociodemographic, psychosocial, and clinical data, MexOMICS has collected samples for genetic determinations across the three registries. Cognitive function assessments, conducted using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, have been administered to a subsample of 376 Mex-PD participants. Furthermore, a subset of 267 twins underwent measurements of structural, functional, and spectroscopy brain images; comparable evaluations are projected for LupusRGMX and Mex-PD.

CONCLUSIONSThe MexOMICS registries offer a valuable repository of information concerning the potential interplay of genetic and environmental factors in health conditions among the Mexican population.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: There are indisputable health benefits to physical activity (PA). By collecting and displaying individual exercise behaviors via wearable trackers, the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile health (mHealth) have made it possible to correlate users&#39; physiological data and daily activity information with their fitness requirements. Objective: This study aimed to recommend personalized exercise to non-pregnant subjects to increase their physical activity level. Methods: We developed smartphone and smartwatch applications to collect, monitor, and recommend exercises using a contextual multi-arm bandit framework. Twenty female college students were recruited to test this mHealth exercise program. Results: Our findings indicated an increase in daily exercise duration (P &lt; .001), with average satisfaction scores for the walking and recommendation system components of 4.31 (0.60) and 3.69 (0.95), respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5. In addition, participants&#39; confidence in their capacity to complete the suggested walking exercises safely and the study&#39;s ability to satisfy their needs for physical activity both received average scores of over 4. Conclusions: A new era of mHealth systems has been ushered in by developments in the Internet of Things and wearable devices. Personalization of physical activity recommendations using such wearables has the potential to improve user engagement and performance. In this paper, we presented an exercise recommendation system based on reinforcement learning that uses biomarkers and the user&#39;s context to recommend a unique walking exercise that enhances the user&#39;s aerobic capacity.</p>
