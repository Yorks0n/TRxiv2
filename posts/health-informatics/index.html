D.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-10-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.05.23296560\nObjectiveTo evaluate the real-world performance in delivering patient data on populations, of the SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR Access API, required in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) under the 21st Century Cures Act Rule. Materials and MethodsWe used an open-source Bulk FHIR Testing Suite at five healthcare sites from April to September 2023, including four hospitals using EHRs certified for interoperability, and one Health Information Exchange (HIE) using a custom, standards-compliant API build. We measured export speeds, data sizes, and completeness across six types of FHIR resources. ResultsAmong the certified platforms, Oracle Cerner led in speed, managing 5-16 million resources at over 8,000 resources/min. Three Epic sites exported a FHIR data subset, achieving 1-12 million resources at 1,555-2,500 resources/min. Notably, the HIEs custom API outperformed, generating over 141 million resources at 12,000 resources/min. DiscussionThe HIEs custom API showcased superior performance, endorsing the effectiveness of SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR in enabling large-scale data exchange while underlining the need for optimization in existing EHR platforms. Agility and scalability are essential for diverse health, research, and public health use cases. ConclusionTo fully realize the interoperability goals of the 21st Century Cures Act, addressing the performance limitations of Bulk FHIR API is critical. It would be beneficial to include performance metrics in both certification and reporting processes.\nHarnessing consumer wearable digital biomarkers for individualized recognition of postpartum depression using the All of Us Research Program dataset\nAuthors: Hurwitz, E.; Butzin-Dozier, Z.; Master, H.; O'Neil, S. T.; Walden, A.; Holko, M.; Patel, R. C.; Haendel, M. A.\nScore: 2.4, Published: 2023-10-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.13.23296965\nPostpartum depression (PPD), afflicting one in seven women, poses a major challenge in maternal health. Existing approaches to detect PPD heavily depend on in-person postpartum visits, leading to cases of the condition being overlooked and untreated. We explored the potential of consumer wearable-derived digital biomarkers for PPD recognition to address this gap. Our study demonstrated that intra-individual machine learning (ML) models developed using these digital biomarkers can discern between pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum without depression, and postpartum with depression time periods (i.e., PPD diagnosis). When evaluating variable importance, calories burned from the basal metabolic rate (calories BMR) emerged as the digital biomarker most predictive of PPD. To confirm the specificity of our method, we demonstrated that models developed in women without PPD could not accurately classify the PPD-equivalent phase. Prior depression history did not alter model efficacy for PPD recognition. Furthermore, the individualized models demonstrated superior performance compared to a conventional cohort-based model for the detection of PPD, underscoring the effectiveness of our individualized ML approach. This work establishes consumer wearables as a promising avenue for PPD identification. More importantly, it also emphasizes the utility of individualized ML model methodology, potentially transforming early disease detection strategies.\nRace Corrections in Clinical Algorithms Can Help Correct for Racial Disparities in Data Quality\nAuthors: Zink, A.; Obermeyer, Z.; Pierson, E.\nScore: 3.4, Published: 2023-10-10 DOI: 10.1101/2023.03.31.23287926\nDespite ethical and historical arguments for removing race corrections from clinical algorithms, the consequences of removal remain unclear. An important and underdiscussed consideration in this debate is the fact that medical data quality frequently varies across race groups. For example, family history of cancer is an essential predictor in cancer risk prediction algorithms but is less reliably documented for Black patients and may therefore be less predictive of cancer outcomes. We assessed whether race corrections could allow risk prediction models to capture varying data quality by race, focusing on colorectal cancer risk prediction. Using data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, we analyzed 77,836 adults with no history of colorectal cancer at baseline. We assessed whether the predictive relationship between self-reported family history of colorectal cancer and 10-year colorectal cancer risk differed by race. We then compared two cancer risk prediction algorithms -- a race-blind algorithm which included standard colorectal cancer risk factors but not race, and a race-corrected algorithm which additionally included race. Family history predicted 10-year colorectal cancer risk among White patients (OR: 1.74, 95% CI 1.25-2.38), but not Black patients (OR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.72-1.29). Relative to the race-blind algorithm, the race-corrected algorithm improved predictive performance, as measured by goodness of fit in a likelihood ratio test (p-value \u003c0.001) and AUROC among Black patients (0.611 versus 0.608, p-value 0.006). Because the race-blind algorithm underpredicted risk for Black participants, the race-corrected algorithm increased the fraction of Black participants among the predicted high-risk group, potentially increasing access to screening. Race corrections can allow risk prediction algorithms to model varying data quality by race group, which frequently occurs in clinical settings.\nLocation of joint involvement differentiates Rheumatoid arthritis into different clinical subsets\nAuthors: Maarseveen, T. D.; Maurits, M. P.; Bohringer, S.; Steinz, N.; Bergstra, S. A.; Boxma-de Klerk, B. B. M.; Van der Helm-van Mil, A. H. M.; Allaart, C. F.; Reinders, M.; Huizinga, T. W. J.; van den Akker, E. B.; Knevel, R.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-10-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295482\nObjectivesTo aid etiology and treatment research of the very heterogeneous rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, we aimed to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets using baseline clinical data. MethodWe collected baseline numerical- (hematology work-up \u0026 age) and categorical variables (serology, joint location \u0026 sex) from the Electronic Health records (EHR) repository of the Leiden University Medical Center, comprising 1,387 unique first visits to the outpatient clinic. We used deep learning and graph clustering to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we tested a) cluster stability (1000 fold) b) physician confounding, c) association with remission and methotrexate failure, d) generalizability to a second different data set (Leiden Early Arthritis clinic; n=769). ResultsWe identified four subsets (C1-C4) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were delineated on the following characteristics: C1) arthritis in feet, C2) seropositive oligo-articular disease, C3) seronegative hand arthritis, C4) polyarthritis. Our validity analyses showed high stability (mean 78%-91%), no physician confounding, and a significant difference in methotrexate failure(P-value=6.1e-4) and occurrence of remission(P-value=7.4e-3), and generalizability to a second dataset. The hand-cluster (III) had the most favorable outcomes (HRremission=1.65 (95%CI:1.20-2.29), HRmethotrexate=0.48 (95%CI:0.35-0.77)), particularly the ACPA-positive patients in this cluster, while in the other clusters the ACPA-negative patients did best. The clusters outperformed standard clinical variables, which were attributed to the hand and feet differentiation. ConclusionsWe discovered four phenotypically distinct subgroups of rheumatoid arthritis at baseline that associate with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, our study provides evidence for the presence of separate hand and foot subgroups in RA Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the subject?C_ST_ABS- Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease and clinicians have not identified the disease discerning patterns in clinical practice. - Rheumatoid arthritis features differ for patients with and without ACPA and by age of onset. - Electronic Health Records features an unprecedented wealth of information, but studying this multimodal high dimensional data source is a methodological challenge. - Data-driven unsupervised techniques are able to identify hidden structures in big data. What does this study add?We identified four novel RA clusters at baseline: feet involvement, oligo-articular disease, hand involvement and polyarthritis. In particular, the hand and feet clusters show a marked difference in outcomes, despite having a similar number of involved joints. The association of both ACPA and age of onset with long-term outcomes differed between the clusters, suggesting that the association between these markers might be different depending on the RA subset. How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?- RA-patients with hand or feet involvement at baseline show differences in long term outcomes, which can be indicative of being distinct phenotypes, possibly requesting different treatment solutions. - Grouping patients into clusters could unveil nuances in the disease entity that might be overlooked when categorizing them based solely on attributes like ACPA, age, and joint inflammation, as the association of these attributes with clinical outcomes differs across the four RA subsets.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Postpartum depression (PPD), afflicting one in seven women, poses a major challenge in maternal health. Existing approaches to detect PPD heavily depend on in-person postpartum visits, leading to cases of the condition being overlooked and untreated. We explored the potential of consumer wearable-derived digital biomarkers for PPD recognition to address this gap. Our study demonstrated that intra-individual machine learning (ML) models developed using these digital biomarkers can discern between pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum without depression, and postpartum with depression time periods (i.e., PPD diagnosis). When evaluating variable importance, calories burned from the basal metabolic rate (calories BMR) emerged as the digital biomarker most predictive of PPD. To confirm the specificity of our method, we demonstrated that models developed in women without PPD could not accurately classify the PPD-equivalent phase. Prior depression history did not alter model efficacy for PPD recognition. Furthermore, the individualized models demonstrated superior performance compared to a conventional cohort-based model for the detection of PPD, underscoring the effectiveness of our individualized ML approach. This work establishes consumer wearables as a promising avenue for PPD identification. More importantly, it also emphasizes the utility of individualized ML model methodology, potentially transforming early disease detection strategies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Despite ethical and historical arguments for removing race corrections from clinical algorithms, the consequences of removal remain unclear. An important and underdiscussed consideration in this debate is the fact that medical data quality frequently varies across race groups. For example, family history of cancer is an essential predictor in cancer risk prediction algorithms but is less reliably documented for Black patients and may therefore be less predictive of cancer outcomes. We assessed whether race corrections could allow risk prediction models to capture varying data quality by race, focusing on colorectal cancer risk prediction. Using data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, we analyzed 77,836 adults with no history of colorectal cancer at baseline. We assessed whether the predictive relationship between self-reported family history of colorectal cancer and 10-year colorectal cancer risk differed by race. We then compared two cancer risk prediction algorithms -- a race-blind algorithm which included standard colorectal cancer risk factors but not race, and a race-corrected algorithm which additionally included race. Family history predicted 10-year colorectal cancer risk among White patients (OR: 1.74, 95% CI 1.25-2.38), but not Black patients (OR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.72-1.29). Relative to the race-blind algorithm, the race-corrected algorithm improved predictive performance, as measured by goodness of fit in a likelihood ratio test (p-value &lt;0.001) and AUROC among Black patients (0.611 versus 0.608, p-value 0.006). Because the race-blind algorithm underpredicted risk for Black participants, the race-corrected algorithm increased the fraction of Black participants among the predicted high-risk group, potentially increasing access to screening. Race corrections can allow risk prediction algorithms to model varying data quality by race group, which frequently occurs in clinical settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo aid etiology and treatment research of the very heterogeneous rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population, we aimed to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets using baseline clinical data.

MethodWe collected baseline numerical- (hematology work-up &amp; age) and categorical variables (serology, joint location &amp; sex) from the Electronic Health records (EHR) repository of the Leiden University Medical Center, comprising 1,387 unique first visits to the outpatient clinic. We used deep learning and graph clustering to identify phenotypically distinct RA subsets. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we tested a) cluster stability (1000 fold) b) physician confounding, c) association with remission and methotrexate failure, d) generalizability to a second different data set (Leiden Early Arthritis clinic; n=769).

ResultsWe identified four subsets (C1-C4) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were delineated on the following characteristics: C1) arthritis in feet, C2) seropositive oligo-articular disease, C3) seronegative hand arthritis, C4) polyarthritis. Our validity analyses showed high stability (mean 78%-91%), no physician confounding, and a significant difference in methotrexate failure(P-value=6.1e-4) and occurrence of remission(P-value=7.4e-3), and generalizability to a second dataset. The hand-cluster (III) had the most favorable outcomes (HRremission=1.65 (95%CI:1.20-2.29), HRmethotrexate=0.48 (95%CI:0.35-0.77)), particularly the ACPA-positive patients in this cluster, while in the other clusters the ACPA-negative patients did best. The clusters outperformed standard clinical variables, which were attributed to the hand and feet differentiation.

ConclusionsWe discovered four phenotypically distinct subgroups of rheumatoid arthritis at baseline that associate with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, our study provides evidence for the presence of separate hand and foot subgroups in RA

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about the subject?C_ST_ABS- Rheumatoid arthritis is a heterogeneous disease and clinicians have not identified the disease discerning patterns in clinical practice.
- Rheumatoid arthritis features differ for patients with and without ACPA and by age of onset.
- Electronic Health Records features an unprecedented wealth of information, but studying this multimodal high dimensional data source is a methodological challenge.
- Data-driven unsupervised techniques are able to identify hidden structures in big data.


What does this study add?We identified four novel RA clusters at baseline: feet involvement, oligo-articular disease, hand involvement and polyarthritis. In particular, the hand and feet clusters show a marked difference in outcomes, despite having a similar number of involved joints.
The association of both ACPA and age of onset with long-term outcomes differed between the clusters, suggesting that the association between these markers might be different depending on the RA subset.


How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?- RA-patients with hand or feet involvement at baseline show differences in long term outcomes, which can be indicative of being distinct phenotypes, possibly requesting different treatment solutions.
- Grouping patients into clusters could unveil nuances in the disease entity that might be overlooked when categorizing them based solely on attributes like ACPA, age, and joint inflammation, as the association of these attributes with clinical outcomes differs across the four RA subsets.</p>
