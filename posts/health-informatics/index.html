This study aimed to develop and externally validate a method using large language models to classify abstracts for diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews, thereby reducing the human workload. We used a previously collected dataset for developing DTA abstract classifiers and applied prompt engineering. We developed an optimized meta-prompt for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to classify abstracts. In the external validation dataset 1, the prompt with GPT-3.5 turbo showed a sensitivity of 0.988, and a specificity of 0.298. GPT-4 showed a sensitivity of 0.982, and a specificity of 0.677. In the external validation dataset 2, GPT-3.5 turbo showed a sensitivity of 0.919, and a specificity of 0.434. GPT-4 showed a sensitivity of 0.806, and a specificity of 0.740. If we included eligible studies from among the references of the identified studies, GPT-3.5 turbo had no critical misses, while GPT-4 had some misses. Our study indicates that GPT-3.5 turbo can be effectively used to classify abstracts for DTA systematic reviews. Further studies using other dataset are warranted to confirm our results. Additionally, we encourage the use of our framework and publicly available dataset for further exploration of more effective classifiers using other LLMs and prompts (https://github.com/youkiti/ARE/).

The eighth iteration of the #SMM4H shared tasks was hosted at the AMIA 2023 Annual Symposium and consisted of five tasks that represented various social media platforms (Twitter and Reddit), languages (English and Spanish), methods (binary classification, multi-class classification, extraction, and normalization), and topics (COVID-19, therapies, social anxiety disorder, and adverse drug events). In total, 29 teams registered, representing 18 countries. In this paper, we present the annotated corpora, a technical summary of the systems, and the performance results. In general, the top-performing systems used deep neural network architectures based on pre-trained transformer models. In particular, the top-performing systems for the classification tasks were based on single models that were pre-trained on social media corpora.
