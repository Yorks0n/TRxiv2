Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.\nTwinRCT-GAN Generates Digital Twins of Randomized Control Trials Adapted to Real-world Patients to Enhance their Inference and Application\nAuthors: Thangaraj, P. M.; Vasisht Shankar, S.; Oikonomou, E. K.; Khera, R.\nScore: 6.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299464\nBackground: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are designed to produce evidence in selected populations. Assessing their effects in the real-world is essential to change medical practice, however, key populations are historically underrepresented in the RCTs. We define an approach to simulate RCT-based effects in real-world settings using RCT digital twins reflecting the covariate patterns in an electronic health record (EHR). Methods: We developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, TwinRCT-GAN, which generates a digital twin of an RCT (TwinRCT) conditioned on covariate distributions from an EHR cohort. We improved upon a traditional tabular conditional GAN, CTGAN, with a loss function adapted for data distributions and by conditioning on multiple discrete and continuous covariates simultaneously. We assessed the similarity between a Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) RCT (TOPCAT), a Yale HFpEF EHR cohort, and TwinRCT. We also evaluated cardiovascular event-free survival stratified by Spironolactone (treatment) use. Results: By applying TwinRCT-GAN to 3445 TOPCAT participants and conditioning on 3445 Yale EHR HFpEF patients, we generated TwinRCT datasets between 1141-3445 patients in size, depending on covariate conditioning and model parameters. TwinRCT randomly allocated spironolactone (S)/ placebo (P) arms like an RCT, was similar to RCT by a multi-dimensional distance metric, and balanced covariates (median absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) 0.017, IQR 0.0034-0.030). The 5 EHR-conditioned covariates in TwinRCT were closer to the EHR compared with the RCT (MASMD 0.008 vs 0.63, IQR 0.005-0.018 vs 0.59-1.11). TwinRCT reproduced the overall effect size seen in TOPCAT (5-year cardiovascular composite outcome odds ratio (95\\% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.75-1.06) in RCT vs 0.85 (0.69-1.04) in TwinRCT). Conclusions: TwinRCT-GAN simulates RCT-derived effects in real-world patients by translating these effects to the covariate distributions of EHR patients. This key methodological advance may enable the direct translation of RCT-derived effects into real-world patient populations and may enable causal inference in real-world settings.\nSARS-CoV-2 Orphan Gene ORF10 Contributes to More Severe COVID-19 Disease\nAuthors: Haltom, J. A.; Trovao, N. S.; Guarnieri, J.; Vincent, P.; Singh, U.; Tsoy, S.; O'Leary, C. A.; Bram, Y.; Widjaja, G. A.; Cen, Z.; Meller, R.; Baylin, S. B.; Moss, W. N.; Nikolau, B. J.; Enguita, F. J.; Wallace, D. C.; Beheshti, A.; Schwartz, R.; Wurtele, E. S.\nScore: 25.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298847\nThe orphan gene of SARS-CoV-2, ORF10, is the least studied gene in the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent experimentation indicated ORF10 expression moderates innate immunity in vitro. However, whether ORF10 affects COVID-19 in humans remained unknown. We determine that the ORF10 sequence is identical to the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral haplotype in 95% of genomes across five variants of concern (VOC). Four ORF10 variants are associated with less virulent clinical outcomes in the human host: three of these affect ORF10 protein structure, one affects ORF10 RNA structural dynamics. RNA-Seq data from 2070 samples from diverse human cells and tissues reveals ORF10 accumulation is conditionally discordant from that of other SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Expression of ORF10 in A549 and HEK293 cells perturbs immune-related gene expression networks, alters expression of the majority of mitochondrially-encoded genes of oxidative respiration, and leads to large shifts in levels of 14 newly-identified transcripts. We conclude ORF10 contributes to more severe COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the human host.\nMulti-omics analysis of the molecular response to glucocorticoids - insights into shared genetic risk from psychiatric to medical disorders\nAuthors: Knauer-Arloth, J.; Hryhorzhevska, A.; Binder, E. B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299430\nBackgroundGlucocorticoids play a crucial role as mediators of negative health effects associated with chronic stress, including increased risk for psychiatric disorders as well as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This study investigates the impact of genetic variants and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-activation on gene expression and DNA methylation in peripheral blood and the relationship of these variants with disease risk. MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, mapping GR-methylation (me)QTLs, GR-expression (e)QTLs, and GR-expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) in a cohort of 199 individuals, with DNA methylation and RNA expression data collected before and after GR-activation with dexamethasone. A multi-level network analysis was employed to map the complex relationships between the transcriptome, epigenome, and genetic variation. ResultsWe identified 3,772 GR-meQTL CpGs corresponding to 114,134 local GR-meQTLs. eQTM and eQTL analyses revealed distinct genetic influences on RNA expression and DNA methylation. Multi-level network analysis uncovered GR-network trio QTLs, characterised by SNP-CpG-transcript combinations where meQTLs act as both eQTLs and eQTMs. These trios genes demonstrated enrichment in immune response and cell activation pathways and showed a significant overlap with transcripts altered by GR-activation in the mouse brain. GR-trio variants were enriched in GWAS for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and traits, cytokines levels and BMI. ConclusionsGenetic variants modulating the molecular effects of glucocorticoids are associated with psychiatric as well as medical diseases. Our findings support stress as a shared risk factor for transdiagnostic negative health outcomes and may lead to innovative interventions targeting shared underlying molecular mechanisms.\nBFCI at #SMM4H 2023: Integration of Machine Learning and TF-IDF for Covid-19 Tweets Analysis\nAuthors: Nayel, H.; Ashraf, N.; Aldawsari, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.18.23297862\nExtracting information from texts generated by users of social media platforms becomes a crucial task. In this paper, we describe the systems submitted to the SMM4H shared tasks 1 and 2. The aims of these two tasks are binary and multi-class classification of English tweets. We developed a machine learning-based model integrated with TF-IDF as a feature extraction approach. Four classification algorithms have been implemented namely, support vector machines, passive-aggressive classifier, multi-layer perceptron and random forest. For task 1, the passive-aggressive classifier reported f1-score of 63.7%. For task 2, multi-layer perceptron reported f1-score of 71.4%.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Background: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are designed to produce evidence in selected populations. Assessing their effects in the real-world is essential to change medical practice, however, key populations are historically underrepresented in the RCTs. We define an approach to simulate RCT-based effects in real-world settings using RCT digital twins reflecting the covariate patterns in an electronic health record (EHR). Methods: We developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, TwinRCT-GAN, which generates a digital twin of an RCT (TwinRCT) conditioned on covariate distributions from an EHR cohort. We improved upon a traditional tabular conditional GAN, CTGAN, with a loss function adapted for data distributions and by conditioning on multiple discrete and continuous covariates simultaneously. We assessed the similarity between a Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) RCT (TOPCAT), a Yale HFpEF EHR cohort, and TwinRCT. We also evaluated cardiovascular event-free survival stratified by Spironolactone (treatment) use. Results: By applying TwinRCT-GAN to 3445 TOPCAT participants and conditioning on 3445 Yale EHR HFpEF patients, we generated TwinRCT datasets between 1141-3445 patients in size, depending on covariate conditioning and model parameters. TwinRCT randomly allocated spironolactone (S)/ placebo (P) arms like an RCT, was similar to RCT by a multi-dimensional distance metric, and balanced covariates (median absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) 0.017, IQR 0.0034-0.030). The 5 EHR-conditioned covariates in TwinRCT were closer to the EHR compared with the RCT (MASMD 0.008 vs 0.63, IQR 0.005-0.018 vs 0.59-1.11). TwinRCT reproduced the overall effect size seen in TOPCAT (5-year cardiovascular composite outcome odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.75-1.06) in RCT vs 0.85 (0.69-1.04) in TwinRCT). Conclusions: TwinRCT-GAN simulates RCT-derived effects in real-world patients by translating these effects to the covariate distributions of EHR patients. This key methodological advance may enable the direct translation of RCT-derived effects into real-world patient populations and may enable causal inference in real-world settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The orphan gene of SARS-CoV-2, ORF10, is the least studied gene in the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent experimentation indicated ORF10 expression moderates innate immunity in vitro. However, whether ORF10 affects COVID-19 in humans remained unknown. We determine that the ORF10 sequence is identical to the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral haplotype in 95% of genomes across five variants of concern (VOC). Four ORF10 variants are associated with less virulent clinical outcomes in the human host: three of these affect ORF10 protein structure, one affects ORF10 RNA structural dynamics. RNA-Seq data from 2070 samples from diverse human cells and tissues reveals ORF10 accumulation is conditionally discordant from that of other SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Expression of ORF10 in A549 and HEK293 cells perturbs immune-related gene expression networks, alters expression of the majority of mitochondrially-encoded genes of oxidative respiration, and leads to large shifts in levels of 14 newly-identified transcripts. We conclude ORF10 contributes to more severe COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the human host.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundGlucocorticoids play a crucial role as mediators of negative health effects associated with chronic stress, including increased risk for psychiatric disorders as well as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This study investigates the impact of genetic variants and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-activation on gene expression and DNA methylation in peripheral blood and the relationship of these variants with disease risk.

MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, mapping GR-methylation (me)QTLs, GR-expression (e)QTLs, and GR-expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) in a cohort of 199 individuals, with DNA methylation and RNA expression data collected before and after GR-activation with dexamethasone. A multi-level network analysis was employed to map the complex relationships between the transcriptome, epigenome, and genetic variation.

ResultsWe identified 3,772 GR-meQTL CpGs corresponding to 114,134 local GR-meQTLs. eQTM and eQTL analyses revealed distinct genetic influences on RNA expression and DNA methylation. Multi-level network analysis uncovered GR-network trio QTLs, characterised by SNP-CpG-transcript combinations where meQTLs act as both eQTLs and eQTMs. These trios genes demonstrated enrichment in immune response and cell activation pathways and showed a significant overlap with transcripts altered by GR-activation in the mouse brain. GR-trio variants were enriched in GWAS for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and traits, cytokines levels and BMI.

ConclusionsGenetic variants modulating the molecular effects of glucocorticoids are associated with psychiatric as well as medical diseases. Our findings support stress as a shared risk factor for transdiagnostic negative health outcomes and may lead to innovative interventions targeting shared underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Extracting information from texts generated by users of social media platforms becomes a crucial task. In this paper, we describe the systems submitted to the SMM4H shared tasks 1 and 2. The aims of these two tasks are binary and multi-class classification of English tweets. We developed a machine learning-based model integrated with TF-IDF as a feature extraction approach. Four classification algorithms have been implemented namely, support vector machines, passive-aggressive classifier, multi-layer perceptron and random forest. For task 1, the passive-aggressive classifier reported f1-score of 63.7%. For task 2, multi-layer perceptron reported f1-score of 71.4%.</p>
