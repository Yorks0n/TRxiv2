J.; Kovacheva, V.\nScore: 14.3, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.16.23293946\nBackgroundPreeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by new onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation that affects 2-8% of all pregnancies and contributes to up to 26% of maternal deaths. Despite extensive clinical research, current predictive tools fail to identify up to 66% of patients who will develop preeclampsia. We sought to develop a tool to longitudinally predict preeclampsia risk. MethodsIn this retrospective model development and validation study, we examined a large cohort of patients who delivered at six community and two tertiary care hospitals in the New England region between 02/2015 and 06/2023. We used sociodemographic, clinical diagnoses, family history, laboratory, and vital signs data. We developed eight datasets at 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models and the relationships between the predictive variables. FindingsOur study population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified. InterpretationOur novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy. FundingNational Institutes of Health, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation. RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCurrent tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 1, 2023, using the keywords \"deep learning\", \"machine learning\", \"preeclampsia\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"pregnancy complications\", and \"predictive models\". We identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability. Added value of this studyWe developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk. Implications of all the available evidenceLongitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and improving perinatal care.\nIdentification of Outcome-Oriented Progression Subtypes from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease Using Electronic Health Records\nAuthors: Xu, J.; Yin, R.; Huang, Y.; Gao, H.; Wu, Y.; Guo, J.; Glenn, S.; DeKosky, S.; Wang, F.; Guo, Y.; Bian, J.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-08-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293270\nAlzheimers disease (AD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that requires an in-depth understanding of its progression pathways and contributing factors to develop effective risk stratification and prevention strategies. In this study, we proposed an outcome-oriented model to identify progression pathways from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD using electronic health records (EHRs) from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD. These pathways can serve as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the factors influencing AD progression and to develop personalized interventions to delay or prevent the onset of the disease.\nDo MOXFQ scores change over time? A retrospective study of podiatric surgery outcomes.\nAuthors: North, V.; Reilly, I. N.; Bridgen, A.; Maher, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293952\nBackgroundRecording patient-reported outcome measurements six months after surgery using PASCOM-10 is common practice in podiatric surgery in the United Kingdom. This study aims to establish if the health-related quality of life after foot surgery is changed at the 12- month point. MethodAn audit of patient-reported outcomes following foot surgery was undertaken. Electronic case notes were examined, and 236 patients were identified over 1 year. Patients completed the Manchester Oxford Foot/Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ) pre-surgery, at six months post-operatively (in person/telephone conversation) and were then invited by letter to complete this again at 12 months post-operatively. Results91 participants (39%) completed both post-operative questionnaires (66 females 25 males), 45% completed a six-month questionnaire only and 61% completed a 12-month questionnaire. The results demonstrate a significant score change between the three time points and across the three MOXFQ domains of walking/standing, pain and social interaction (0.353, F [6, 356] = 40.59, p \u003c.001), and a further interaction with gender (0.435, F [6,352] = 30.23, p \u003c.001). An average, positive change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across all domains was the greatest from pre-surgery to six months post-surgery at 78% improved, and then decreased to 62% improved at 12 months post-surgery. Females experience lower HRQOL before surgery, at 6 months and at 12-month post-operation time points but gain the greatest improvement over pre-operative scores at 30%. ConclusionA patient-centred approach is key in foot surgery, patient-reported health-related quality of life changes significantly at different time points. In this review, the overall health- related quality of life improved with surgery at the six- and 12-month point, but with some deterioration at 12 months. A short period of recovery may not yield genuine long-term patient- reported outcomes, and an increase to a minimum of 12 months is recommended from the more common six months. However, the different methods of collecting post-operative data at various time points may have had an influence on scores. Level of clinical evidence:4\nChatGPT, Enhanced with Clinical Practice Guidelines, is a Superior Decision Support Tool\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Visweswaran, S.; Kappor, S.; Kooragayalu, S.; Wu, X.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293890\nChatGPT has gained remarkable traction since its inception in November 2022. However, it faces limitations in generating inaccurate responses, ignoring existing guidelines, and lacking reasoning when applied in clinical settings. This study introduces ChatGPT-CARE, a tool that integrates clinical practice guidelines with ChatGPT, focusing on COVID-19 outpatient treatment decisions. By employing in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shots learning, ChatGPT-CARE enhances original ChatGPTs clinical decision support and reasoning capabilities. The tool was evaluated using three categories of various descriptions of patients seeking COVID-19 treatment, and two physicians specialized in pulmonary disease and critical care assessed the responses for accuracy, hallucination, and clarity. The results indicate that ChatGPT-CARE, particularly the GPT-4 version, offers higher accuracy and clarity compared to the original ChatGPT. Despite some limitations, such as occasional hallucinations, ChatGPT-CARE represents a significant advancement in AI-driven clinical decision support, with potential applications beyond COVID-19 treatment.\nAI-Enhanced Integration of Genetic and Medical Imaging Data for Risk Assessment of Type 2 Diabetes\nAuthors: Huang, Y.-J.; Chen, C.-h.; Yang, H.-C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294093\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.\nMicrosoft Bing outperforms five other generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the Antwerp University multiple choice medical license exam\nAuthors: Morreel, S.; Verhoeven, V.; Mathysen, D.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294263\nRecently developed chatbots based on large language models (further called bots) have promising features which could facilitate medical education. Several bots are freely available, but their proficiency has been insufficiently evaluated. In this study the authors have tested the current performance on the multiple-choice medical licensing exam of University of Antwerp (Belgium) of six widely used bots: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), New Bing (Microsoft), Claude instant (Anthropic), Claude+ (Anthropic) and GPT-4 (OpenAI). The primary outcome was the performance on the exam expressed as a proportion of correct answers. Secondary analyses were done for a variety of features in the exam questions: easy versus difficult questions, grammatically positive versus negative questions, and clinical vignettes versus theoretical questions. Reasoning errors and untruthful statements (hallucinations) in the bots answers were examined. All bots passed the exam; Bing and GPT-4 (both 76% correct answers) outperformed the other bots (62-67%, p= 0.03) and students (61%). Bots performed worse on difficult questions (62%, p= 0.06), but outperformed students (32%) on those questions even more (p\u003c0.01). Hallucinations were found in 7% of Bings and GPT4s answers, significantly lower than Bard (22%, p\u003c0.01) and Claude Instant (19%, p=0.02). Although the creators of all bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions. Bing was able to detect weak or ambiguous exam questions. Bots could be used as a time efficient tool to improve the quality of a multiple-choice exam.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPreeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by new onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation that affects 2-8% of all pregnancies and contributes to up to 26% of maternal deaths. Despite extensive clinical research, current predictive tools fail to identify up to 66% of patients who will develop preeclampsia. We sought to develop a tool to longitudinally predict preeclampsia risk.

MethodsIn this retrospective model development and validation study, we examined a large cohort of patients who delivered at six community and two tertiary care hospitals in the New England region between 02/2015 and 06/2023. We used sociodemographic, clinical diagnoses, family history, laboratory, and vital signs data. We developed eight datasets at 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models and the relationships between the predictive variables.

FindingsOur study population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified.

InterpretationOur novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCurrent tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 1, 2023, using the keywords &#34;deep learning&#34;, &#34;machine learning&#34;, &#34;preeclampsia&#34;, &#34;artificial intelligence&#34;, &#34;pregnancy complications&#34;, and &#34;predictive models&#34;. We identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability.

Added value of this studyWe developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceLongitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and improving perinatal care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that requires an in-depth understanding of its progression pathways and contributing factors to develop effective risk stratification and prevention strategies. In this study, we proposed an outcome-oriented model to identify progression pathways from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD using electronic health records (EHRs) from the OneFlorida&#43; Clinical Research Consortium. To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD. These pathways can serve as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the factors influencing AD progression and to develop personalized interventions to delay or prevent the onset of the disease.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRecording patient-reported outcome measurements six months after surgery using PASCOM-10 is common practice in podiatric surgery in the United Kingdom. This study aims to establish if the health-related quality of life after foot surgery is changed at the 12- month point.

MethodAn audit of patient-reported outcomes following foot surgery was undertaken. Electronic case notes were examined, and 236 patients were identified over 1 year. Patients completed the Manchester Oxford Foot/Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ) pre-surgery, at six months post-operatively (in person/telephone conversation) and were then invited by letter to complete this again at 12 months post-operatively.

Results91 participants (39%) completed both post-operative questionnaires (66 females 25 males), 45% completed a six-month questionnaire only and 61% completed a 12-month questionnaire. The results demonstrate a significant score change between the three time points and across the three MOXFQ domains of walking/standing, pain and social interaction (0.353, F [6, 356] = 40.59, p &lt;.001), and a further interaction with gender (0.435, F [6,352] = 30.23, p &lt;.001). An average, positive change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across all domains was the greatest from pre-surgery to six months post-surgery at 78% improved, and then decreased to 62% improved at 12 months post-surgery. Females experience lower HRQOL before surgery, at 6 months and at 12-month post-operation time points but gain the greatest improvement over pre-operative scores at 30%.

ConclusionA patient-centred approach is key in foot surgery, patient-reported health-related quality of life changes significantly at different time points. In this review, the overall health- related quality of life improved with surgery at the six- and 12-month point, but with some deterioration at 12 months. A short period of recovery may not yield genuine long-term patient- reported outcomes, and an increase to a minimum of 12 months is recommended from the more common six months. However, the different methods of collecting post-operative data at various time points may have had an influence on scores.

        <p class="abstract">ChatGPT has gained remarkable traction since its inception in November 2022. However, it faces limitations in generating inaccurate responses, ignoring existing guidelines, and lacking reasoning when applied in clinical settings. This study introduces ChatGPT-CARE, a tool that integrates clinical practice guidelines with ChatGPT, focusing on COVID-19 outpatient treatment decisions. By employing in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shots learning, ChatGPT-CARE enhances original ChatGPTs clinical decision support and reasoning capabilities. The tool was evaluated using three categories of various descriptions of patients seeking COVID-19 treatment, and two physicians specialized in pulmonary disease and critical care assessed the responses for accuracy, hallucination, and clarity. The results indicate that ChatGPT-CARE, particularly the GPT-4 version, offers higher accuracy and clarity compared to the original ChatGPT. Despite some limitations, such as occasional hallucinations, ChatGPT-CARE represents a significant advancement in AI-driven clinical decision support, with potential applications beyond COVID-19 treatment.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recently developed chatbots based on large language models (further called bots) have promising features which could facilitate medical education. Several bots are freely available, but their proficiency has been insufficiently evaluated. In this study the authors have tested the current performance on the multiple-choice medical licensing exam of University of Antwerp (Belgium) of six widely used bots:  ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), New Bing (Microsoft), Claude instant (Anthropic), Claude&#43; (Anthropic) and GPT-4 (OpenAI). The primary outcome was the performance on the exam expressed as a proportion of correct answers. Secondary analyses were done for a variety of features in the exam questions: easy versus difficult questions, grammatically positive versus negative questions, and clinical vignettes versus theoretical questions. Reasoning errors and untruthful statements (hallucinations) in the bots answers were examined. All bots passed the exam; Bing and GPT-4 (both 76% correct answers) outperformed the other bots (62-67%, p= 0.03) and students (61%). Bots performed worse on difficult questions (62%, p= 0.06), but outperformed students (32%) on those questions even more (p&lt;0.01). Hallucinations were found in 7% of Bings and GPT4s answers, significantly lower than Bard (22%, p&lt;0.01) and Claude Instant (19%, p=0.02). Although the creators of all bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions. Bing was able to detect weak or ambiguous exam questions. Bots could be used as a time efficient tool to improve the quality of a multiple-choice exam.</p>
