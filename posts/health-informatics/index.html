D.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.24301681\nPoor sleep quality in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) individuals is linked to severe daytime behaviors. This study explores the relationship between a prior night's sleep structure and its predictive power for next-day behavior in ASD individuals. The motion was extracted using a low-cost near-infrared camera in a privacy-preserving way. Over two years, we recorded overnight data from 14 individuals, spanning over 2,000 nights, and tracked challenging daytime behaviors, including aggression, self-injury, and disruption. We developed an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict next-day behavior in the morning and the afternoon. Our findings indicate that sleep quality is a more reliable predictor of morning behavior than afternoon behavior the next day. The proposed model attained an accuracy of 74\\% and a F1 score of 0.74 in target-sensitive tasks and 67\\% accuracy and 0.69 F1 score in target-insensitive tasks. For 7 of the 14, better-than-chance balanced accuracy was obtained (p-value$\u003c$0.05), with 3 showing significant trends (p-value$\u003c$0.1). These results suggest off-body, privacy-preserving sleep monitoring as a viable method for predicting next-day adverse behavior in ASD individuals, with the potential for behavioral intervention and enhanced care in social and learning settings.\nEnhanced Patient Portal Engagement Associated with Improved Weight Loss Outcomes in Post-Bariatric Surgery Patients\nAuthors: Zhang, X.; Kang, K.; Yan, C.; Feng, Y.; Vandekar, S.; Yu, D.; Rosenbloom, S. T.; Samuels, J.; Srivastava, G.; Williams, B.; Albaugh, V. L.; English, W. J.; Flynn, C. R.; Chen, Y.\nScore: 5.6, Published: 2024-01-21 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.20.24301550\nBackgroundBariatric surgery is an effective intervention for obesity, but it requires comprehensive postoperative self-management to achieve optimal outcomes. While patient portals are generally seen as beneficial in engaging patients in health management, the link between their use and post-bariatric surgery weight loss remains unclear. ObjectiveThis study investigated the association between patient portal engagement and postoperative body mass index (BMI) reduction among bariatric surgery patients. MethodsThis retrospective longitudinal study included patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between January 2018 and March 2021. Using generalized estimating equations, we estimated the association between active days of postoperative patient portal use and the reduction of BMI percentage (%BMI) at 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Covariates included duration since surgery, the patients age at the time of surgery, gender, race and ethnicity, type of bariatric surgery, severity of comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic disadvantage. ResultsThe study included 1,415 patients, mostly female (80.9%), with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. 805 (56.9%) patients underwent RYGB and 610 (43.1%) underwent SG. By one-year post-surgery, the mean (SD) %BMI reduction was 31.1% (8.3%), and the mean (SD) number of patient portal active days was 61.0 (41.2). A significantly positive association was observed between patient portal engagement and %BMI reduction, with variations revealed over time. Each 10-day increment of active portal use was associated with a 0.57% ([95% CI: 0.42- 0.72], P \u003c .001) and 0.35% ([95% CI: 0.22- 0.49], P \u003c .001) %BMI reduction at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The association was not statistically significant at 12 months postoperatively ({beta}=-0.07, [95% CI: -0.24- 0.09], P = .54). Various portal functions, including messaging, visits, my record, medical tools, billing, resources, and others, were positively associated with %BMI reduction at 3- and 6-months follow-ups. ConclusionsGreater patient portal engagement, which may represent stronger adherence to postoperative instructions, better self-management of health, and enhanced communication with care teams, was associated with improved postoperative weight loss. Future investigations are needed to identify important portal features that contribute to the long-term success of weight loss management.\nImpact of Vaccination Rates and Gross Domestic Product on COVID-19 Pandemic Mortality Across United States\nAuthors: Matveeva, O.; Ogurtsov, A. Y.; Shabalina, S. A.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-22 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.21.24301582\nObjectiveTo investigate the relationship between vaccination rates and excess mortality during distinct waves of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific infections, while considering a states GDP per capita. MethodsWe ranked U.S. states by vaccination rates and GDP and employed the CDCs excess mortality model for regression and odds ratio analysis. ResultsRegression analysis reveals that both vaccination and GDP are significant factors related to mortality when considering the entire U.S. population. Notably, in wealthier states (with GDP above $65,000), excess mortality is primarily driven by slow vaccination rates, while in less affluent states, low GDP plays a major role. Odds ratio analysis demonstrates an almost twofold increase in mortality linked to the Delta and Omicron BA.1 virus variants in states with the slowest vaccination rates compared to those with the fastest (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-1.9, p \u003c 0.01). However, this gap disappeared in the post-Omicron BA.1 period. ConclusionThe interplay between slow vaccination and low GDP per capita drives high mortality.\nPrompt Engineering GPT-4 to Answer Patient Inquiries: A Real-Time Implementation in the Electronic Health Record across Provider Clinics\nAuthors: Afshar, M.; Gao, Y.; Wills, G.; Wang, J.; Churpek, M. M.; Westenberger, C. J.; Kunstman, D. T.; Gordon, J. E.; Liao, F. J.; Patterson, B. W.\nScore: 4.2, Published: 2024-01-24 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.23.24301692\nBackground: The integration of Large Language Models like GPT-4 in healthcare has opened new avenues for improving patient-provider communication. However, the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies, which have been shown to affect the quality and accuracy of model output, remains unexplored in this context. This study aims to evaluate the impact of manual versus semi-automated prompt engineering to improve the usability of AI-generated responses to patient inquiries with real-time integration into an electronic health record. Methods: A pre-post study over eight months was conducted at University of Wisconsin Health, involving 27 providers across multiple specialties. The study compared GPT-4 in a pre-period use of manual prompts with a post-period semi-automated engineered prompt that incorporated iterative design and prompt evaluation scoring. Testing by informaticists was completed before deployment of the new prompt. The primary outcome was the number of AI-generated draft messages used in a mixed effects model accounting for multiple messages by same provider. Secondary outcomes included message editing metrics and sentiment analysis. Results: Of the 7,605 draft messages generated by GPT-4 and seen by providers during the study period, 17.5% (n=1,327) were used by the providers and 2.6% (n=202) were left identical or nearly identical in editing by the providers. The number of messages used decreased in the post-period with the new prompt (beta coefficient -0.10; 95% CI: -0.11 - -0.09, p\u003c0.01); however, there was a reduction in negative sentiment with an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.36 - 0.52, p\u003c0.01) with the new prompt design. Discussion: The decrease in negative sentiment with the new prompt demonstrated improvement in the AI-generated content quality but usage remained low by providers. This study highlights a need for better alignment between prompt engineering and human factors engineering.\nPatient experiences of UK primary care online triage and consultation platforms during COVID-19: A systematic review\nAuthors: Roberts, C.; George, J.; Jenkins, J.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.09.24301062\nBackgroundOnline triage and consultation platforms are being increasingly used by healthcare providers in the UK for patient/clinician interactions. COVID-19 accelerated the shift towards the use of these platforms to maintain healthcare provision and reduce transmission. Strict directives were introduced by the UK Government to avoid in-person contact wherever possible in March 2020. AimTo examine patients experiences of online triage and consultation in UK primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer considerations for their continued use. DesignThis study follows the PRISMA framework and includes qualitative studies conducted in UK primary care based on the experiences of patient users of any such online platform during the period of March 2020 to April 2023. Studies were included using the PICO format. Three literature databases were searched for relevant studies: PubMed, Science Direct and EMBASE. CASP is used to assess data quality. Results540 studies were reviewed and reduced to 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study characteristics were identified as: year of study, study population, disease types/conditions, patient response themes and the studys data capture method. A thematic inductive approach identifies three overarching themes (Accessibility, Care delivery, System functionality) and 10 sub-themes (Affordability, IT literacy, Communication, Convenience, Care quality, Patient safety/privacy, Usability, Continuity of care, Inequality and Media influence). ConclusionThis review highlights aspects of patient satisfaction and benefit but also those most concerning for patients. This study reviews the rapid, compulsory adoption of these systems during COVID-19 with implications for their future implementation beyond the pandemic.\nEvaluating and Mitigating Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Decision Making\nAuthors: Hager, P.; Jungmann, F.; Bhagat, K.; Hubrecht, I.; Knauer, M.; Vielhauer, J.; Holland, R.; Braren, R.; Makowski, M.; Kaisis, G.; Rueckert, D.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-26 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.26.24301810\nClinical decision making is one of the most impactful parts of a physician's responsibilities and stands to benefit greatly from AI solutions and large language models (LLMs) in particular. However, while LLMs have achieved excellent performance on medical licensing exams, these tests fail to assess many skills that are necessary for deployment in a realistic clinical decision making environment, including gathering information, adhering to established guidelines, and integrating into clinical workflows. To understand how useful LLMs are in real-world settings, we must evaluate them in the wild, i.e. on real-world data under realistic conditions. Here we have created a curated dataset based on the MIMIC-IV database spanning 2400 real patient cases and four common abdominal pathologies as well as a framework to simulate a realistic clinical setting. We show that current state-of-the-art LLMs do not accurately diagnose patients across all pathologies (performing significantly worse than physicians on average), follow neither diagnostic nor treatment guidelines, and cannot interpret laboratory results, thus posing a serious risk to the health of patients. Furthermore, we move beyond diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated into existing workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our analysis reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for clinical deployment while providing a dataset and framework to guide future studies.\n",

For 7 of the 14, better-than-chance balanced accuracy was obtained (p-value$&lt;$0.05), with 3 showing significant trends (p-value$&lt;$0.1). These results suggest off-body, privacy-preserving sleep monitoring as a viable method for predicting next-day adverse behavior in ASD individuals, with the potential for behavioral intervention and enhanced care in social and learning settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundBariatric surgery is an effective intervention for obesity, but it requires comprehensive postoperative self-management to achieve optimal outcomes. While patient portals are generally seen as beneficial in engaging patients in health management, the link between their use and post-bariatric surgery weight loss remains unclear.

ObjectiveThis study investigated the association between patient portal engagement and postoperative body mass index (BMI) reduction among bariatric surgery patients.

MethodsThis retrospective longitudinal study included patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between January 2018 and March 2021. Using generalized estimating equations, we estimated the association between active days of postoperative patient portal use and the reduction of BMI percentage (%BMI) at 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery. Covariates included duration since surgery, the patients age at the time of surgery, gender, race and ethnicity, type of bariatric surgery, severity of comorbid conditions, and socioeconomic disadvantage.

ResultsThe study included 1,415 patients, mostly female (80.9%), with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. 805 (56.9%) patients underwent RYGB and 610 (43.1%) underwent SG. By one-year post-surgery, the mean (SD) %BMI reduction was 31.1% (8.3%), and the mean (SD) number of patient portal active days was 61.0 (41.2). A significantly positive association was observed between patient portal engagement and %BMI reduction, with variations revealed over time. Each 10-day increment of active portal use was associated with a 0.57% ([95% CI: 0.42- 0.72], P &lt; .001) and 0.35% ([95% CI: 0.22- 0.49], P &lt; .001) %BMI reduction at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The association was not statistically significant at 12 months postoperatively ({beta}=-0.07, [95% CI: -0.24- 0.09], P = .54). Various portal functions, including messaging, visits, my record, medical tools, billing, resources, and others, were positively associated with %BMI reduction at 3- and 6-months follow-ups.

ConclusionsGreater patient portal engagement, which may represent stronger adherence to postoperative instructions, better self-management of health, and enhanced communication with care teams, was associated with improved postoperative weight loss. Future investigations are needed to identify important portal features that contribute to the long-term success of weight loss management.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo investigate the relationship between vaccination rates and excess mortality during distinct waves of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific infections, while considering a states GDP per capita.

MethodsWe ranked U.S. states by vaccination rates and GDP and employed the CDCs excess mortality model for regression and odds ratio analysis.

ResultsRegression analysis reveals that both vaccination and GDP are significant factors related to mortality when considering the entire U.S. population. Notably, in wealthier states (with GDP above $65,000), excess mortality is primarily driven by slow vaccination rates, while in less affluent states, low GDP plays a major role. Odds ratio analysis demonstrates an almost twofold increase in mortality linked to the Delta and Omicron BA.1 virus variants in states with the slowest vaccination rates compared to those with the fastest (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-1.9, p &lt; 0.01). However, this gap disappeared in the post-Omicron BA.1 period.

ConclusionThe interplay between slow vaccination and low GDP per capita drives high mortality.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: The integration of Large Language Models like GPT-4 in healthcare has opened new avenues for improving patient-provider communication. However, the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies, which have been shown to affect the quality and accuracy of model output, remains unexplored in this context. This study aims to evaluate the impact of manual versus semi-automated prompt engineering to improve the usability of AI-generated responses to patient inquiries with real-time integration into an electronic health record. Methods: A pre-post study over eight months was conducted at University of Wisconsin Health, involving 27 providers across multiple specialties. The study compared GPT-4 in a pre-period use of manual prompts with a post-period semi-automated engineered prompt that incorporated iterative design and prompt evaluation scoring. Testing by informaticists was completed before deployment of the new prompt. The primary outcome was the number of AI-generated draft messages used in a mixed effects model accounting for multiple messages by same provider. Secondary outcomes included message editing metrics and sentiment analysis. Results: Of the 7,605 draft messages generated by GPT-4 and seen by providers during the study period, 17.5% (n=1,327) were used by the providers and 2.6% (n=202) were left identical or nearly identical in editing by the providers. The number of messages used decreased in the post-period with the new prompt (beta coefficient -0.10; 95% CI: -0.11 - -0.09, p&lt;0.01); however, there was a reduction in negative sentiment with an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.36 - 0.52, p&lt;0.01) with the new prompt design. Discussion: The decrease in negative sentiment with the new prompt demonstrated improvement in the AI-generated content quality but usage remained low by providers. This study highlights a need for better alignment between prompt engineering and human factors engineering.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundOnline triage and consultation platforms are being increasingly used by healthcare providers in the UK for patient/clinician interactions. COVID-19 accelerated the shift towards the use of these platforms to maintain healthcare provision and reduce transmission. Strict directives were introduced by the UK Government to avoid in-person contact wherever possible in March 2020.

AimTo examine patients experiences of online triage and consultation in UK primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic and offer considerations for their continued use.

DesignThis study follows the PRISMA framework and includes qualitative studies conducted in UK primary care based on the experiences of patient users of any such online platform during the period of March 2020 to April 2023. Studies were included using the PICO format. Three literature databases were searched for relevant studies: PubMed, Science Direct and EMBASE. CASP is used to assess data quality.

Results540 studies were reviewed and reduced to 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Study characteristics were identified as: year of study, study population, disease types/conditions, patient response themes and the studys data capture method. A thematic inductive approach identifies three overarching themes (Accessibility, Care delivery, System functionality) and 10 sub-themes (Affordability, IT literacy, Communication, Convenience, Care quality, Patient safety/privacy, Usability, Continuity of care, Inequality and Media influence).

ConclusionThis review highlights aspects of patient satisfaction and benefit but also those most concerning for patients. This study reviews the rapid, compulsory adoption of these systems during COVID-19 with implications for their future implementation beyond the pandemic.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical decision making is one of the most impactful parts of a physician&#39;s responsibilities and stands to benefit greatly from AI solutions and large language models (LLMs) in particular. However, while LLMs have achieved excellent performance on medical licensing exams, these tests fail to assess many skills that are necessary for deployment in a realistic clinical decision making environment, including gathering information, adhering to established guidelines, and integrating into clinical workflows. To understand how useful LLMs are in real-world settings, we must evaluate them in the wild, i.e. on real-world data under realistic conditions. Here we have created a curated dataset based on the MIMIC-IV database spanning 2400 real patient cases and four common abdominal pathologies as well as a framework to simulate a realistic clinical setting. We show that current state-of-the-art LLMs do not accurately diagnose patients across all pathologies (performing significantly worse than physicians on average), follow neither diagnostic nor treatment guidelines, and cannot interpret laboratory results, thus posing a serious risk to the health of patients. Furthermore, we move beyond diagnostic accuracy and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated into existing workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our analysis reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for clinical deployment while providing a dataset and framework to guide future studies.</p>
