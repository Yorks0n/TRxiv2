Despite extensive clinical research, current predictive tools fail to identify up to 66% of patients who will develop preeclampsia. We sought to develop a tool to longitudinally predict preeclampsia risk. MethodsIn this retrospective model development and validation study, we examined a large cohort of patients who delivered at six community and two tertiary care hospitals in the New England region between 02/2015 and 06/2023. We used sociodemographic, clinical diagnoses, family history, laboratory, and vital signs data. We developed eight datasets at 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models and the relationships between the predictive variables. FindingsOur study population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified. InterpretationOur novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy. FundingNational Institutes of Health, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation. RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCurrent tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 1, 2023, using the keywords \"deep learning\", \"machine learning\", \"preeclampsia\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"pregnancy complications\", and \"predictive models\". We identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability. Added value of this studyWe developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk. Implications of all the available evidenceLongitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and improving perinatal care.\nPatients Accessing their Online Records in England: A Survey of General Practitioners' Experiences and Opinions\nAuthors: Blease, C.; Kharko, A.; Dong, Z.; Jones, R.; Davidge, G.; Hagglund, M.; Turner, A.; DesRoches, C.; McMillan, B.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-08-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.21.23294326\nObjectiveTo describe the experiences and opinions of general practitioners (GPs) in England regarding patients having access to their full online GP health record. DesignConvenience sample, online survey. Participants400 registered GPs in England. Main outcome measuresInvestigators measured GPs experiences and opinions about online record access (ORA) including on patient care, and on their practice. ResultsA total of 400 GPs from all regions of England responded. A minority (130, 33%) believed ORA was a good idea. Most GPs believed a majority of patients would worry more (364, 91%) or find their GP records more confusing than helpful (338, 85%). In contrast, most GPs believed a majority of patients would find significant errors in their records (240, 60%), would better remember their care plan (280, 70%), and feel more in control of their care (243, 60%). The majority believed they will/already spend more time addressing patients questions outside of consultations (357, 89%), that consultations will/already take significantly longer (322, 81%), and reported they will be/already are less candid in their documentation (289, 72%) after ORA. Nearly two thirds of GPs believed ORA would increase their litigation (246, 62%). ConclusionsSimilar to clinicians in other countries, GPs in our sample were sceptical of ORA believing patients would worry more and find their records more confusing than helpful. Most GPs also believed the practice would exacerbate work burdens. However, the majority of GPs in this survey also agreed there were multiple benefits to patients having online access to their primary care health record.\nHarnessing the Open Access Version of ChatGPT for Enhanced Clinical Opinions\nAuthors: Tenner, Z. M.; Cottone, M.; Chavez, M.\nScore: 1.8, Published: 2023-08-24 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.23.23294478\nWith the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the integration of AI into clinical medicine is becoming increasingly feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 to generate complex differential diagnoses, comparing its output to case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Forty case records were presented to ChatGPT-3.5, with prompts to provide a differential diagnosis and then narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis. Results indicated that the final diagnosis was included in ChatGPT-3.5's original differential list in 42.5% of the cases. After narrowing, ChatGPT correctly determined the final diagnosis in 27.5% of the cases, demonstrating a decrease in accuracy compared to previous studies using common chief complaints. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios, while highlighting the potential role of AI as an augmented clinical opinion. With anticipated growth and enhancements to AI tools like ChatGPT, physicians and other healthcare workers will likely find increasing support in generating differential diagnoses. However, continued exploration and regulation are essential to ensure the safe and effective integration of AI into healthcare practice. Future studies may seek to compare newer versions of ChatGPT or investigate patient outcomes with physician integration of this AI technology. By understanding and expanding AIs capabilities, particularly in differential diagnosis, the medical field may foster innovation and provide additional resources, especially in underserved areas.\nAI-Enhanced Integration of Genetic and Medical Imaging Data for Risk Assessment of Type 2 Diabetes\nAuthors: Huang, Y.-J.; Chen, C.-h.; Yang, H.-C.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.23294093\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.\nMicrosoft Bing outperforms five other generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the Antwerp University multiple choice medical license exam\nAuthors: Morreel, S.; Verhoeven, V.; Mathysen, D.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2023-08-21 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.18.23294263\nRecently developed chatbots based on large language models (further called bots) have promising features which could facilitate medical education. Several bots are freely available, but their proficiency has been insufficiently evaluated. In this study the authors have tested the current performance on the multiple-choice medical licensing exam of University of Antwerp (Belgium) of six widely used bots: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), New Bing (Microsoft), Claude instant (Anthropic), Claude+ (Anthropic) and GPT-4 (OpenAI). The primary outcome was the performance on the exam expressed as a proportion of correct answers. Secondary analyses were done for a variety of features in the exam questions: easy versus difficult questions, grammatically positive versus negative questions, and clinical vignettes versus theoretical questions. Reasoning errors and untruthful statements (hallucinations) in the bots answers were examined. All bots passed the exam; Bing and GPT-4 (both 76% correct answers) outperformed the other bots (62-67%, p= 0.03) and students (61%). Bots performed worse on difficult questions (62%, p= 0.06), but outperformed students (32%) on those questions even more (p\u003c0.01). Hallucinations were found in 7% of Bings and GPT4s answers, significantly lower than Bard (22%, p\u003c0.01) and Claude Instant (19%, p=0.02). Although the creators of all bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions. Bing was able to detect weak or ambiguous exam questions. Bots could be used as a time efficient tool to improve the quality of a multiple-choice exam. Author SummaryArtificial chatbots such as ChatGPT have recently gained a lot of attention. They can pass exams for medical doctors, sometimes they even perform better than regular students. In this study, we have tested ChatGPT and five other (newer) chatbots in the multiple-choice exam that students in Antwerp (Belgium) must pass to obtain the degree of medical doctor. All bots passed the exam with results similar or better than the students. Microsoft Bing scored the best of all tested bots but still produces hallucinations (untruthful statements or reasoning errors) in seven percent of the answers. Bots performed worse on difficult questions but they outperformed students on those questions even more. Maybe they are most useful when humans dont know the answer themselves? The creators of the bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions. Microsoft Bing also turns out to be useful to find weak questions and as such improve the exam.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPreeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by new onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation that affects 2-8% of all pregnancies and contributes to up to 26% of maternal deaths.

We developed eight datasets at 14, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39 weeks gestation and at the hospital admission for delivery. We created linear regression, random forest, xgboost, and deep neural networks to develop multiple models and compared their performance. We used Shapley values to investigate the global and local explainability of the models and the relationships between the predictive variables.

FindingsOur study population (N=120,752) had an incidence of preeclampsia of 5.7% (N=6,920). The performance of the models as measured using the area under the curve, AUC, was in the range 0.73-0.91, which was externally validated. The relationships between some of the variables were complex and non-linear; in addition, the relative significance of the predictors varied over the pregnancy. Compared to the current standard of care for preeclampsia risk stratification in the first trimester, our model would allow 48.6% more at-risk patients to be identified.

InterpretationOur novel preeclampsia prediction tool would allow clinicians to identify patients at risk early and provide personalized predictions, as well as longitudinal predictions throughout pregnancy.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCurrent tools for the prediction of preeclampsia are lacking as they fail to identify up to 66% of the patients who develop preeclampsia. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Web of Science from database inception to May 1, 2023, using the keywords &#34;deep learning&#34;, &#34;machine learning&#34;, &#34;preeclampsia&#34;, &#34;artificial intelligence&#34;, &#34;pregnancy complications&#34;, and &#34;predictive models&#34;. We identified 13 studies that employed machine learning to develop prediction models for preeclampsia risk based on clinical variables. Among these studies, six included biomarkers such as serum placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, and uterine artery pulsatility index, which are not routinely available in our clinical practice; two studies were in diverse cohorts of more than 100 000 patients, and two studies developed longitudinal predictions using medical records data. However, most studies have limited depth, concerns about data leakage, overfitting, or lack of generalizability.

Added value of this studyWe developed a comprehensive longitudinal predictive tool based on routine clinical data that can be used throughout pregnancy to predict the risk of preeclampsia. We tested multiple types of predictive models, including machine learning and deep learning models, and demonstrated high predictive power. We investigated the changes over different time points of individual and group variables and found previously known and novel relationships between variables such as red blood cell count and preeclampsia risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceLongitudinal prediction of preeclampsia using machine learning can be achieved with high performance. Implementation of an accurate predictive tool within the electronic health records can aid clinical care and identify patients at heightened risk who would benefit from aspirin prophylaxis, increased surveillance, early diagnosis, and escalation in care. These results highlight the potential of using artificial intelligence in clinical decision support, with the ultimate goal of reducing iatrogenic preterm birth and improving perinatal care.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ObjectiveTo describe the experiences and opinions of general practitioners (GPs) in England regarding patients having access to their full online GP health record.

DesignConvenience sample, online survey.

Participants400 registered GPs in England.

Main outcome measuresInvestigators measured GPs experiences and opinions about online record access (ORA) including on patient care, and on their practice.

ResultsA total of 400 GPs from all regions of England responded. A minority (130, 33%) believed ORA was a good idea. Most GPs believed a majority of patients would worry more (364, 91%) or find their GP records more confusing than helpful (338, 85%). In contrast, most GPs believed a majority of patients would find significant errors in their records (240, 60%), would better remember their care plan (280, 70%), and feel more in control of their care (243, 60%). The majority believed they will/already spend more time addressing patients questions outside of consultations (357, 89%), that consultations will/already take significantly longer (322, 81%), and reported they will be/already are less candid in their documentation (289, 72%) after ORA. Nearly two thirds of GPs believed ORA would increase their litigation (246, 62%).

ConclusionsSimilar to clinicians in other countries, GPs in our sample were sceptical of ORA believing patients would worry more and find their records more confusing than helpful. Most GPs also believed the practice would exacerbate work burdens. However, the majority of GPs in this survey also agreed there were multiple benefits to patients having online access to their primary care health record.</p>

        <p class="abstract">With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, the integration of AI into clinical medicine is becoming increasingly feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the freely available ChatGPT-3.5 to generate complex differential diagnoses, comparing its output to case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Forty case records were presented to ChatGPT-3.5, with prompts to provide a differential diagnosis and then narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis. Results indicated that the final diagnosis was included in ChatGPT-3.5&#39;s original differential list in 42.5% of the cases. After narrowing, ChatGPT correctly determined the final diagnosis in 27.5% of the cases, demonstrating a decrease in accuracy compared to previous studies using common chief complaints. These findings emphasize the need for further investigation into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in clinical scenarios, while highlighting the potential role of AI as an augmented clinical opinion. With anticipated growth and enhancements to AI tools like ChatGPT, physicians and other healthcare workers will likely find increasing support in generating differential diagnoses. However, continued exploration and regulation are essential to ensure the safe and effective integration of AI into healthcare practice. Future studies may seek to compare newer versions of ChatGPT or investigate patient outcomes with physician integration of this AI technology. By understanding and expanding AIs capabilities, particularly in differential diagnosis, the medical field may foster innovation and provide additional resources, especially in underserved areas.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The models performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Recently developed chatbots based on large language models (further called bots) have promising features which could facilitate medical education. Several bots are freely available, but their proficiency has been insufficiently evaluated. In this study the authors have tested the current performance on the multiple-choice medical licensing exam of University of Antwerp (Belgium) of six widely used bots: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), New Bing (Microsoft), Claude instant (Anthropic), Claude&#43; (Anthropic) and GPT-4 (OpenAI). The primary outcome was the performance on the exam expressed as a proportion of correct answers. Secondary analyses were done for a variety of features in the exam questions: easy versus difficult questions, grammatically positive versus negative questions, and clinical vignettes versus theoretical questions. Reasoning errors and untruthful statements (hallucinations) in the bots answers were examined. All bots passed the exam; Bing and GPT-4 (both 76% correct answers) outperformed the other bots (62-67%, p= 0.03) and students (61%). Bots performed worse on difficult questions (62%, p= 0.06), but outperformed students (32%) on those questions even more (p&lt;0.01). Hallucinations were found in 7% of Bings and GPT4s answers, significantly lower than Bard (22%, p&lt;0.01) and Claude Instant (19%, p=0.02). Although the creators of all bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions.

Bing was able to detect weak or ambiguous exam questions. Bots could be used as a time efficient tool to improve the quality of a multiple-choice exam.

Author SummaryArtificial chatbots such as ChatGPT have recently gained a lot of attention. They can pass exams for medical doctors, sometimes they even perform better than regular students. In this study, we have tested ChatGPT and five other (newer) chatbots in the multiple-choice exam that students in Antwerp (Belgium) must pass to obtain the degree of medical doctor. All bots passed the exam with results similar or better than the students. Microsoft Bing scored the best of all tested bots but still produces hallucinations (untruthful statements or reasoning errors) in seven percent of the answers. Bots performed worse on difficult questions but they outperformed students on those questions even more. Maybe they are most useful when humans dont know the answer themselves? The creators of the bots try to some extent to avoid their bots being used as a medical doctor, none of the tested bots succeeded as none refused to answer all clinical case questions. Microsoft Bing also turns out to be useful to find weak questions and as such improve the exam.</p>
