  "articleBody": " SARS-CoV-2 Infection is Associated with an Increase in New Diagnoses of Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorder: A Study Using the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)\nAuthors: Rahman, A.; Russell, M.; Zheng, W.; Eckrich, D.; Ahmed, I.; on behalf of the N3C Consortium, Score: 701.6, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299473\nAmid the ongoing global repercussions of SARS-CoV-2, its crucial to comprehend its potential long-term psychiatric effects. Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.\nTwinRCT-GAN Generates Digital Twins of Randomized Control Trials Adapted to Real-world Patients to Enhance their Inference and Application\nAuthors: Thangaraj, P. M.; Vasisht Shankar, S.; Oikonomou, E. K.; Khera, R.\nScore: 8.7, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.23299464\nBackgroundRandomized clinical trials (RCTs) are designed to produce evidence in selected populations. Assessing their effects in the real-world is essential to change medical practice, however, key populations are historically underrepresented in the RCTs. We define an approach to simulate RCT-based effects in real-world settings using RCT digital twins reflecting the covariate patterns in an electronic health record (EHR). MethodsWe developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, TwinRCT-GAN, which generates a digital twin of an RCT (TwinRCT) conditioned on covariate distributions from an EHR cohort. We improved upon a traditional tabular conditional GAN, CTGAN, with a loss function adapted for data distributions and by conditioning on multiple discrete and continuous covariates simultaneously. We assessed the similarity between a Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) RCT (TOPCAT), a Yale HFpEF EHR cohort, and TwinRCT. We also evaluated cardiovascular event-free survival stratified by Spironolactone (treatment) use. ResultsBy applying TwinRCT-GAN to 3445 TOPCAT participants and conditioning on 3445 Yale EHR HFpEF patients, we generated TwinRCT datasets between 1141-3445 patients in size, depending on covariate conditioning and model parameters. TwinRCT randomly allocated spironolactone (S)/ placebo (P) arms like an RCT, was similar to RCT by a multidimensional distance metric, and balanced co-variates (median absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) 0.017, IQR 0.0034-0.030). The 5 EHR-conditioned covariates in TwinRCT were closer to the EHR compared with the RCT (MASMD 0.008 vs 0.63, IQR 0.005-0.018 vs 0.59-1.11). TwinRCT reproduced the overall effect size seen in TOPCAT (5-year cardiovascular composite outcome odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.75-1.06) in RCT vs 0.85 (0.69-1.04) in TwinRCT). ConclusionsTwinRCT-GAN simulates RCT-derived effects in real-world patients by translating these effects to the covariate distributions of EHR patients. This key methodological advance may enable the direct translation of RCT-derived effects into real-world patient populations and may enable causal inference in real-world settings.\nStudying social anxiety without triggering it: Establishing an age-controlled cohort of social media users for observational studies\nAuthors: Schmidt, A. L.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.; O'COnnor, K.; Rodriguez-Esteban, R.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299645\nBackground: Patients of certain diseases are less likely to approach the healthcare system but remain active in social media. Young Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) patients, in particular, are a hard-to-reach population due to disease symptomatology, unmet need and age-related barriers, which makes obtaining first-hand access to patient perspectives challenging. Objective: To create a curated cohort of patients from social media that report their age in the range of 13 to 25 years old and confirm having a SAD diagnosis or having received therapy for SAD, and to assess the value of the content posted by these users for observational studies of SAD. Methods: We collected 535k posts by 118k Reddit users from the r/SocialAnxiety subreddit. We then developed precise regular expressions to extract age, diagnosis and therapy mentions. We manually annotated the full set of expressions extracted and double-annotated 5% of the age mentions and 10% of the diagnosis and therapy mentions. Using similar methodology, we identified mentions of comorbidities and substance use. Results: Our validated cohort includes 37,073 posts by 1,102 users that meet the inclusion criteria. The age, diagnosis, and therapy mention detection had a precision of 68%, 31%, and 44%, respectively, with an inter-annotator agreement of 0.96, 0.96, and 0.78. Sixty-one percent of the users in the cohort report having one or more comorbidities on top of their SAD diagnosis (Fleiss's Kappa=0.79) and 13% report a concerning use of drugs or alcohol (Fleiss's Kappa=0.87). We compared the characteristics of our social media cohort to the published literature on SAD. Conclusions: Patients with SAD post actively on Reddit and their perspectives can be captured and studied directly from these data. Extracting age, therapy, substance abuse and comorbidities (and potentially other patient data) can address real-world data source biases. Thus, social media is a valuable source to create cohorts of hard-to-reach patient populations that may not enter the healthcare system.\nSARS-CoV-2 Orphan Gene ORF10 Contributes to More Severe COVID-19 Disease\nAuthors: Haltom, J. A.; Trovao, N. S.; Guarnieri, J.; Vincent, P.; Singh, U.; Tsoy, S.; O'Leary, C. A.; Bram, Y.; Widjaja, G. A.; Cen, Z.; Meller, R.; Baylin, S. B.; Moss, W. N.; Nikolau, B. J.; Enguita, F. J.; Wallace, D. C.; Beheshti, A.; Schwartz, R.; Wurtele, E. S.\nScore: 26.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.27.23298847\nThe orphan gene of SARS-CoV-2, ORF10, is the least studied gene in the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent experimentation indicated ORF10 expression moderates innate immunity in vitro. However, whether ORF10 affects COVID-19 in humans remained unknown. We determine that the ORF10 sequence is identical to the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral haplotype in 95% of genomes across five variants of concern (VOC). Four ORF10 variants are associated with less virulent clinical outcomes in the human host: three of these affect ORF10 protein structure, one affects ORF10 RNA structural dynamics. RNA-Seq data from 2070 samples from diverse human cells and tissues reveals ORF10 accumulation is conditionally discordant from that of other SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Expression of ORF10 in A549 and HEK293 cells perturbs immune-related gene expression networks, alters expression of the majority of mitochondrially-encoded genes of oxidative respiration, and leads to large shifts in levels of 14 newly-identified transcripts. We conclude ORF10 contributes to more severe COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the human host.\nAI learns racial information from the values of vital signs\nAuthors: Velichkovska, B.; Gjoreski, H.; Denkovski, D.; Kalendar, M.; Dankwa-Mullan, I.; Gichoya, J.; Martinez-Martin, N.; Celi, L.; Osmani, V.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299819\nBackground: Bias in medical practice is multifaceted, including treatment variations across race-ethnicity, unconscious bias in healthcare providers' attitudes, and bias in clinical scores. However, far less is known about the potential racial bias in routinely collected, essential information in clinical decision-making, namely vital signs. Research question: Do vital signs embed racial information that can be learned by AI algorithms? Study Design and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients between 2014 and 2015 from the multi-centre eICU-CRD critical care database involving 335 Intensive Care Units (ICU) based in 208 US hospitals, containing 200,859 patient admissions. We extracted 10,763 critical care admissions of patients aged 18 and over, alive during the first 24 hours after admission to ICU with recorded self-reported race as well as at least two measurement of heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Pairs of racial subgroups were matched based on age, gender, admission diagnosis and APACHE IV scores. Traditional machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to predict self-reported race using values of vital signs as an input. Results: AI models derived from only six vital signs can predict patients' self-reported race with an AUC of 0.74 (+/- 0.022) between White and Black patients. Technologies used to measure oxygen saturation are a significant source of self-reported racial information (AUC of 0.72 +/- 0.028), in addition to blood pressure measurements (AUC of 0.63 +/- 0.035). Care delivery practices do not present a significant source of racial information (AUC of 0.57 +/- 0.019). However, even when controlling for these known factors, self-reported race can still be learned from vital signs, whose origin we cannot currently explain. Interpretation: Vital signs embed racial information that can be learned by AI algorithms, posing a significant risk to equitable clinical decision-making. Mitigating measures might be challenging, considering fundamental role of vital signs.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Amid the ongoing global repercussions of SARS-CoV-2, its crucial to comprehend its potential long-term psychiatric effects. Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRandomized clinical trials (RCTs) are designed to produce evidence in selected populations. Assessing their effects in the real-world is essential to change medical practice, however, key populations are historically underrepresented in the RCTs. We define an approach to simulate RCT-based effects in real-world settings using RCT digital twins reflecting the covariate patterns in an electronic health record (EHR).

MethodsWe developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, TwinRCT-GAN, which generates a digital twin of an RCT (TwinRCT) conditioned on covariate distributions from an EHR cohort. We improved upon a traditional tabular conditional GAN, CTGAN, with a loss function adapted for data distributions and by conditioning on multiple discrete and continuous covariates simultaneously. We assessed the similarity between a Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) RCT (TOPCAT), a Yale HFpEF EHR cohort, and TwinRCT. We also evaluated cardiovascular event-free survival stratified by Spironolactone (treatment) use.

ResultsBy applying TwinRCT-GAN to 3445 TOPCAT participants and conditioning on 3445 Yale EHR HFpEF patients, we generated TwinRCT datasets between 1141-3445 patients in size, depending on covariate conditioning and model parameters. TwinRCT randomly allocated spironolactone (S)/ placebo (P) arms like an RCT, was similar to RCT by a multidimensional distance metric, and balanced co-variates (median absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) 0.017, IQR 0.0034-0.030). The 5 EHR-conditioned covariates in TwinRCT were closer to the EHR compared with the RCT (MASMD 0.008 vs 0.63, IQR 0.005-0.018 vs 0.59-1.11). TwinRCT reproduced the overall effect size seen in TOPCAT (5-year cardiovascular composite outcome odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.89 (0.75-1.06) in RCT vs 0.85 (0.69-1.04) in TwinRCT).

ConclusionsTwinRCT-GAN simulates RCT-derived effects in real-world patients by translating these effects to the covariate distributions of EHR patients. This key methodological advance may enable the direct translation of RCT-derived effects into real-world patient populations and may enable causal inference in real-world settings.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Patients of certain diseases are less likely to approach the healthcare system but remain active in social media. Young Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) patients, in particular, are a hard-to-reach population due to disease symptomatology, unmet need and age-related barriers, which makes obtaining first-hand access to patient perspectives challenging. Objective: To create a curated cohort of patients from social media that report their age in the range of 13 to 25 years old and confirm having a SAD diagnosis or having received therapy for SAD, and to assess the value of the content posted by these users for observational studies of SAD. Methods: We collected 535k posts by 118k Reddit users from the r/SocialAnxiety subreddit. We then developed precise regular expressions to extract age, diagnosis and therapy mentions. We manually annotated the full set of expressions extracted and double-annotated 5% of the age mentions and 10% of the diagnosis and therapy mentions. Using similar methodology, we identified mentions of comorbidities and substance use. Results: Our validated cohort includes 37,073 posts by 1,102 users that meet the inclusion criteria. The age, diagnosis, and therapy mention detection had a precision of 68%, 31%, and 44%, respectively, with an inter-annotator agreement of 0.96, 0.96, and 0.78. Sixty-one percent of the users in the cohort report having one or more comorbidities on top of their SAD diagnosis (Fleiss&#39;s Kappa=0.79) and 13% report a concerning use of drugs or alcohol (Fleiss&#39;s Kappa=0.87). We compared the characteristics of our social media cohort to the published literature on SAD. Conclusions: Patients with SAD post actively on Reddit and their perspectives can be captured and studied directly from these data. Extracting age, therapy, substance abuse and comorbidities (and potentially other patient data) can address real-world data source biases. Thus, social media is a valuable source to create cohorts of hard-to-reach patient populations that may not enter the healthcare system.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The orphan gene of SARS-CoV-2, ORF10, is the least studied gene in the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent experimentation indicated ORF10 expression moderates innate immunity in vitro. However, whether ORF10 affects COVID-19 in humans remained unknown. We determine that the ORF10 sequence is identical to the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral haplotype in 95% of genomes across five variants of concern (VOC). Four ORF10 variants are associated with less virulent clinical outcomes in the human host: three of these affect ORF10 protein structure, one affects ORF10 RNA structural dynamics. RNA-Seq data from 2070 samples from diverse human cells and tissues reveals ORF10 accumulation is conditionally discordant from that of other SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. Expression of ORF10 in A549 and HEK293 cells perturbs immune-related gene expression networks, alters expression of the majority of mitochondrially-encoded genes of oxidative respiration, and leads to large shifts in levels of 14 newly-identified transcripts. We conclude ORF10 contributes to more severe COVID-19 clinical outcomes in the human host.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Bias in medical practice is multifaceted, including treatment variations across race-ethnicity, unconscious bias in healthcare providers&#39; attitudes, and bias in clinical scores. However, far less is known about the potential racial bias in routinely collected, essential information in clinical decision-making, namely vital signs. Research question: Do vital signs embed racial information that can be learned by AI algorithms? Study Design and Methods: Retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients between 2014 and 2015 from the multi-centre eICU-CRD critical care database involving 335 Intensive Care Units (ICU) based in 208 US hospitals, containing 200,859 patient admissions. We extracted 10,763 critical care admissions of patients aged 18 and over, alive during the first 24 hours after admission to ICU with recorded self-reported race as well as at least two measurement of heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Pairs of racial subgroups were matched based on age, gender, admission diagnosis and APACHE IV scores. Traditional machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost and Logistic regression were used to predict self-reported race using values of vital signs as an input. Results: AI models derived from only six vital signs can predict patients&#39; self-reported race with an AUC of 0.74 (&#43;/- 0.022) between White and Black patients. Technologies used to measure oxygen saturation are a significant source of self-reported racial information (AUC of 0.72 &#43;/- 0.028), in addition to blood pressure measurements (AUC of 0.63 &#43;/- 0.035). Care delivery practices do not present a significant source of racial information (AUC of 0.57 &#43;/- 0.019). However, even when controlling for these known factors, self-reported race can still be learned from vital signs, whose origin we cannot currently explain. Interpretation: Vital signs embed racial information that can be learned by AI algorithms, posing a significant risk to equitable clinical decision-making. Mitigating measures might be challenging, considering fundamental role of vital signs.</p>
