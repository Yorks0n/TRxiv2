In this study, we proposed an outcome-oriented model to identify progression pathways from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD using electronic health records (EHRs) from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD. These pathways can serve as a valuable resource for researchers to understand the factors influencing AD progression and to develop personalized interventions to delay or prevent the onset of the disease.\nChatGPT, Enhanced with Clinical Practice Guidelines, is a Superior Decision Support Tool\nAuthors: Wang, Y.; Visweswaran, S.; Kappor, S.; Kooragayalu, S.; Wu, X.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2023-08-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.23293890\nChatGPT has gained remarkable traction since its inception in November 2022. However, it faces limitations in generating inaccurate responses, ignoring existing guidelines, and lacking reasoning when applied in clinical settings. This study introduces ChatGPT-CARE, a tool that integrates clinical practice guidelines with ChatGPT, focusing on COVID-19 outpatient treatment decisions. By employing in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and few-shots learning, ChatGPT-CARE enhances original ChatGPTs clinical decision support and reasoning capabilities. The tool was evaluated using three categories of various descriptions of patients seeking COVID-19 treatment, and two physicians specialized in pulmonary disease and critical care assessed the responses for accuracy, hallucination, and clarity. The results indicate that ChatGPT-CARE, particularly the GPT-4 version, offers higher accuracy and clarity compared to the original ChatGPT. Despite some limitations, such as occasional hallucinations, ChatGPT-CARE represents a significant advancement in AI-driven clinical decision support, with potential applications beyond COVID-19 treatment.\nDo MOXFQ scores change over time? A retrospective study of podiatric surgery outcomes.\nAuthors: North, V.; Reilly, I. N.; Bridgen, A.; Maher, A.\nScore: 2.1, Published: 2023-08-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.23293952\nBackgroundRecording patient-reported outcome measurements six months after surgery using PASCOM-10 is common practice in podiatric surgery in the United Kingdom. This study aims to establish if the health-related quality of life after foot surgery is changed at the 12- month point. MethodAn audit of patient-reported outcomes following foot surgery was undertaken. Electronic case notes were examined, and 236 patients were identified over 1 year. Patients completed the Manchester Oxford Foot/Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ) pre-surgery, at six months post-operatively (in person/telephone conversation) and were then invited by letter to complete this again at 12 months post-operatively. Results91 participants (39%) completed both post-operative questionnaires (66 females 25 males), 45% completed a six-month questionnaire only and 61% completed a 12-month questionnaire. The results demonstrate a significant score change between the three time points and across the three MOXFQ domains of walking/standing, pain and social interaction (0.353, F [6, 356] = 40.59, p \u003c.001), and a further interaction with gender (0.435, F [6,352] = 30.23, p \u003c.001). An average, positive change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across all domains was the greatest from pre-surgery to six months post-surgery at 78% improved, and then decreased to 62% improved at 12 months post-surgery. Females experience lower HRQOL before surgery, at 6 months and at 12-month post-operation time points but gain the greatest improvement over pre-operative scores at 30%. ConclusionA patient-centred approach is key in foot surgery, patient-reported health-related quality of life changes significantly at different time points. In this review, the overall health- related quality of life improved with surgery at the six- and 12-month point, but with some deterioration at 12 months. A short period of recovery may not yield genuine long-term patient- reported outcomes, and an increase to a minimum of 12 months is recommended from the more common six months. However, the different methods of collecting post-operative data at various time points may have had an influence on scores.

Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals' health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The model's performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.\n",

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundRecording patient-reported outcome measurements six months after surgery using PASCOM-10 is common practice in podiatric surgery in the United Kingdom. This study aims to establish if the health-related quality of life after foot surgery is changed at the 12- month point.

MethodAn audit of patient-reported outcomes following foot surgery was undertaken. Electronic case notes were examined, and 236 patients were identified over 1 year. Patients completed the Manchester Oxford Foot/Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ) pre-surgery, at six months post-operatively (in person/telephone conversation) and were then invited by letter to complete this again at 12 months post-operatively.

Results91 participants (39%) completed both post-operative questionnaires (66 females 25 males), 45% completed a six-month questionnaire only and 61% completed a 12-month questionnaire. The results demonstrate a significant score change between the three time points and across the three MOXFQ domains of walking/standing, pain and social interaction (0.353, F [6, 356] = 40.59, p &lt;.001), and a further interaction with gender (0.435, F [6,352] = 30.23, p &lt;.001). An average, positive change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) across all domains was the greatest from pre-surgery to six months post-surgery at 78% improved, and then decreased to 62% improved at 12 months post-surgery. Females experience lower HRQOL before surgery, at 6 months and at 12-month post-operation time points but gain the greatest improvement over pre-operative scores at 30%.

ConclusionA patient-centred approach is key in foot surgery, patient-reported health-related quality of life changes significantly at different time points. In this review, the overall health- related quality of life improved with surgery at the six- and 12-month point, but with some deterioration at 12 months. A short period of recovery may not yield genuine long-term patient- reported outcomes, and an increase to a minimum of 12 months is recommended from the more common six months. However, the different methods of collecting post-operative data at various time points may have had an influence on scores.

        <p class="abstract">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health concern due to its increasing prevalence. Risk assessment and early detection of T2D are vital in improving individuals&#39; health, reducing the burden on health insurance, and enhancing well-being. This study leverages artificial intelligence (AI), specifically eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to develop predictive models for T2D based on genetic and medical imaging data. The study aims to establish a prediction model and identify high-risk subgroups for T2D within a cohort of 68,911 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. The approach integrates the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) and Multi-image Risk Score (MRS) with demographic factors and environmental exposures to assess T2D risk. The model&#39;s performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). Results demonstrate that genetic information alone is insufficient for accurate T2D prediction (AUC = 0.73), whereas medical imaging data, including abdominal ultrasonography, vertebral artery ultrasonography, bone density scan, and electrocardiography, significantly improves prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.89). The best-performing model integrates genetic, medical imaging, and demographic variables (AUC = 0.94), successfully identifying subgroups at high risk of developing T2D. The study also presents an online risk assessment website for T2D. In summary, this research represents the first integration of genetic and medical imaging data for T2D risk assessment. The genetic-only model outperforms previous genetic prediction studies, and integrating genetic and medical imaging information significantly enhances prediction. By utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze genetic, medical imaging, and demographic factors, this study contributes to early detection and precision health of T2D.</p>
