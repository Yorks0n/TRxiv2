W.; Segura-Bedmar, I.; Birney, E.; Herrero-Zazo, M.\nScore: 7.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296481\nElectronic health record (EHR) systems with prescription data offer vast potential in pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacogenomics. The large amount of clinical data recorded in these systems requires automatic processing to extract relevant information. This paper introduces PRESNER, a name entity recognition (NER) and classification pipeline for EHR prescription data. The pipeline uses the pre-trained transformer Bio-ClinicalBERT fine-tuned on UK Biobank prescription entries manually annotated with medication-related information (drug name, route of administration, pharmaceutical form, strength, and dosage) as the core NER system. Moreover, PRESNER also maps drugs to the Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical (ATC) classification system and distinguishes between systemic and non-systemic drug products. It outperformed a baseline model combining the state-of-the-art Med7 and a dictionary-based approach from the ChEMBL database with a macro-average F1-score of 0.95 vs 0.71. In addition to UK Biobank prescription data, PRESNER can also be applied to other English prescription datasets, making it a versatile tool for researchers in the field.\nLongitudinal Trajectories of Symptom Change During Antidepressant Treatment Among Managed Care Patients with Co-Occurring Depression and Anxiety\nAuthors: Cukor, J.; Xu, Z.; Vekaria, V.; Wang, F.; Olfson, M.; Banerjee, S.; Simon, G. E.; Alexopoulos, G. S.; Pathak, J.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23295985\nDepression and anxiety are highly correlated, yet little is known about the course of each condition when presenting concurrently. This study aimed to identify longitudinal patterns and changes in depression and anxiety symptoms during antidepressant treatment, and evaluate clinical factors associated with each response pattern. Self-report Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores were used to track the courses of depression and anxiety respectively over a three-month window, and group-based trajectory modeling was used to derive subgroups of patients who have similar response patterns. Multinomial regression was used to associate various clinical variables with trajectory subgroup membership. Of the 577 included adults, 373 (64.6%) were women, and the mean age was 39.3 (SD: 12.9) years. Six depression and six anxiety trajectory subgroups were computationally derived; three depression subgroups demonstrated symptom improvement, and three exhibited nonresponse. Similar patterns were observed in the six anxiety subgroups. Factors associated with treatment nonresponse included higher pretreatment depression and anxiety severity and poorer sleep quality, while better overall health and younger age were associated with higher rates of remission. Synchronous and asynchronous paths to improvement were also observed between depression and anxiety. High baseline depression or anxiety severity alone may be an insufficient predictor of treatment nonresponse. These findings have the potential to motivate clinical strategies aimed at treating depression and anxiety simultaneously.\nRandomized Controlled Trials Evaluating AI in Clinical Practice: A Scoping Evaluation\nAuthors: Han, R.; Acosta, J. N.; Shakeri, Z.; Ioannidis, J.; Topol, E.; Rajpurkar, P.\nScore: 95.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295381\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with numerous studies indicating its potential to perform as well or better than clinicians. However, a considerable portion of these AI models have only been tested retrospectively, raising concerns about their true effectiveness and potential risks in real-world clinical settings. MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving AI algorithms used in various clinical practice fields and locations, published between January 1, 2018, and August 18, 2023. Our study included 84 trials and focused specifically on evaluating intervention characteristics, study endpoints, and trial outcomes, including the potential of AI to improve care management, patient behavior and symptoms, and clinical decision-making. ResultsOur analysis revealed that 82{middle dot}1% (69/84) of trials reported positive results for their primary endpoint, highlighting AIs potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare. Trials predominantly evaluated deep learning systems for medical imaging and were conducted in single-center settings. The US and China had the most trials, with gastroenterology being the most common field of study. However, we also identified areas requiring further research, such as multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, to better understand AIs true impact and limitations in healthcare. ConclusionThe existing landscape of RCTs on AI in clinical practice demonstrates an expanding interest in applying AI across a range of fields and locations. While most trials report positive outcomes, more comprehensive research, including multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, is essential to fully understand AIs impact and limitations in healthcare.\nExplainable artificial intelligence for cough-related quality of life impairment prediction in asthmatic patients\nAuthors: Narteni, S.; Baiardini, I.; Braido, F.; Mongelli, M.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296540\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming a disruptive trend in healthcare, allowing for transparency and interpretability of autonomous decision-making. In this study, we present an innovative application of a rule-based classification model to identify the main causes of chronic cough-related quality of life (QoL) impairment in a cohort of asthmatic patients. The proposed approach first involves the design of a suitable symptoms questionnaire and the subsequent analyses via XAI. Specifically, feature ranking, derived from statistically validated decision rules, helped in automatically identifying the main factors influencing an impaired QoL: pharynx/larynx and upper airways when asthma is under control, and asthma itself and digestive trait when asthma is not controlled. Moreover, the obtained if-then rules identified specific thresholds on the symptoms associated to the impaired QoL. These results, by finding priorities among symptoms, may prove helpful in supporting physicians in the choice of the most adequate diagnostic/therapeutic plan.\nCharacterization of Long COVID Definitions and Clinical Coding Practices\nAuthors: Maripuri, M.; Dey, A. T.; Honerlaw, J. P.; Hong, C.; Ho, Y.-L.; Tanukonda, V.; Chen, A. W.; Panickan, V. A.; Wang, X.; Yang, D.; Zhang, H. G.; Samayamuthu, M. J.; Morris, M.; Visweswaran, S.; Beaulieu-Jones, B. R.; Ramoni, R. B.; Muralidhar, S.; Gaziano, M. J.; Liao, K.; Xia, Z.; Brat, G. A.; Cai, T.; Cho, K.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2023-10-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.04.23296301\nBackground: Long COVID characterized as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) has no universal clinical case definition. Recent efforts have focused on understanding long COVID symptoms and electronic health records (EHR) data provides a unique resource for understanding this condition. The introduction of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code U09.9 for - Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified to identify patients with long COVID has provided a method of evaluating this condition in EHRs, however, the accuracy of this code is unclear. Objective: Our study aimed to characterize the utility and accuracy of the U09.9 code across three healthcare systems - The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) against patients identified with long COVID via a chart review by operationalizing the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definitions. Methods: COVID positive patients with either a U07.1 ICD code or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within these healthcare systems were identified for chart review. Among this cohort we sampled patients based on two approaches i) with a U09.9 code and ii) without a U09.9 code but with a new onset PASC related ICD code, which allows us to assess the sensitivity of the U09.9 code. To operationalize the long COVID definition based on health agency guidelines, we grouped symptoms into a core cluster of 11 commonly reported symptoms among long COVID patients and an extended cluster, that captured all other symptoms by disease domain. Patients having at least 2 symptoms persisting for \u003e=60 days that were new onset after their COVID infection, with at least one symptom in the core cluster, were labeled as having long COVID per chart review. We compared the performance of the code across three health systems and across different time periods of the pandemic. Results: A total of 900 patient charts were reviewed across 3 healthcare systems. The prevalence of long COVID among the cohort with the U09.9 ICD code, based on the operationalized WHO definition was between 23.2%-62.4% across these healthcare systems. We also evaluated a less stringent version of the WHO definition and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition and observed an increase in the prevalence of long COVID at all three healthcare systems. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to evaluate the U09.9 code against a clinical case definition for long COVID, as well as the first to apply this definition to EHR data using a chart review approach on a nationwide cohort across multiple healthcare systems. This chart review approach can be implemented at other EHR systems to further evaluate the utility and performance of the U09.9 code.\nMeasuring and Reducing Racial Bias in a Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection Model\nAuthors: Anderson, J. W.; Shaikh, N.; Visweswaran, S.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-09-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.18.23295660\nClinical predictive models that include race as a predictor have the potential to exacerbate disparities in healthcare. Such models can be respecified to exclude race or optimized to reduce racial bias. We investigated the impact of such respecifications in a predictive model - UTICalc - which was designed to reduce catheterizations in young children with suspected urinary tract infections. To reduce racial bias, race was removed from the UTICalc logistic regression model and replaced with two new features. We compared the two versions of UTICalc using fairness and predictive performance metrics to understand the effects on racial bias. In addition, we derived three new models for UTICalc to specifically improve racial fairness. Our results show that, as predicted by previously described impossibility results, fairness cannot be simultaneously improved on all fairness metrics, and model respecification may improve racial fairness but decrease overall predictive performance.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Depression and anxiety are highly correlated, yet little is known about the course of each condition when presenting concurrently. This study aimed to identify longitudinal patterns and changes in depression and anxiety symptoms during antidepressant treatment, and evaluate clinical factors associated with each response pattern. Self-report Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores were used to track the courses of depression and anxiety respectively over a three-month window, and group-based trajectory modeling was used to derive subgroups of patients who have similar response patterns. Multinomial regression was used to associate various clinical variables with trajectory subgroup membership. Of the 577 included adults, 373 (64.6%) were women, and the mean age was 39.3 (SD: 12.9) years. Six depression and six anxiety trajectory subgroups were computationally derived; three depression subgroups demonstrated symptom improvement, and three exhibited nonresponse. Similar patterns were observed in the six anxiety subgroups. Factors associated with treatment nonresponse included higher pretreatment depression and anxiety severity and poorer sleep quality, while better overall health and younger age were associated with higher rates of remission. Synchronous and asynchronous paths to improvement were also observed between depression and anxiety. High baseline depression or anxiety severity alone may be an insufficient predictor of treatment nonresponse. These findings have the potential to motivate clinical strategies aimed at treating depression and anxiety simultaneously.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with numerous studies indicating its potential to perform as well or better than clinicians. However, a considerable portion of these AI models have only been tested retrospectively, raising concerns about their true effectiveness and potential risks in real-world clinical settings.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving AI algorithms used in various clinical practice fields and locations, published between January 1, 2018, and August 18, 2023. Our study included 84 trials and focused specifically on evaluating intervention characteristics, study endpoints, and trial outcomes, including the potential of AI to improve care management, patient behavior and symptoms, and clinical decision-making.

ResultsOur analysis revealed that 82{middle dot}1% (69/84) of trials reported positive results for their primary endpoint, highlighting AIs potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare. Trials predominantly evaluated deep learning systems for medical imaging and were conducted in single-center settings. The US and China had the most trials, with gastroenterology being the most common field of study. However, we also identified areas requiring further research, such as multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, to better understand AIs true impact and limitations in healthcare.

ConclusionThe existing landscape of RCTs on AI in clinical practice demonstrates an expanding interest in applying AI across a range of fields and locations. While most trials report positive outcomes, more comprehensive research, including multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, is essential to fully understand AIs impact and limitations in healthcare.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is becoming a disruptive trend in healthcare, allowing for transparency and interpretability of autonomous decision-making. In this study, we present an innovative application of a rule-based classification model to identify the main causes of chronic cough-related quality of life (QoL) impairment in a cohort of asthmatic patients. The proposed approach first involves the design of a suitable symptoms questionnaire and the subsequent analyses via XAI. Specifically, feature ranking, derived from statistically validated decision rules, helped in automatically identifying the main factors influencing an impaired QoL: pharynx/larynx and upper airways when asthma is under control, and asthma itself and digestive trait when asthma is not controlled. Moreover, the obtained if-then rules identified specific thresholds on the symptoms associated to the impaired QoL. These results, by finding priorities among symptoms, may prove helpful in supporting physicians in the choice of the most adequate diagnostic/therapeutic plan.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Background: Long COVID characterized as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) has no universal clinical case definition. Recent efforts have focused on understanding long COVID symptoms and electronic health records (EHR) data provides a unique resource for understanding this condition. The introduction of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code U09.9 for - Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified to identify patients with long COVID has provided a method of evaluating this condition in EHRs, however, the accuracy of this code is unclear. Objective: Our study aimed to characterize the utility and accuracy of the U09.9 code across three healthcare systems - The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) against patients identified with long COVID via a chart review by operationalizing the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definitions. Methods: COVID positive patients with either a U07.1 ICD code or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within these healthcare systems were identified for chart review. Among this cohort we sampled patients based on two approaches i) with a U09.9 code and ii) without a U09.9 code but with a new onset PASC related ICD code, which allows us to assess the sensitivity of the U09.9 code. To operationalize the long COVID definition based on health agency guidelines, we grouped symptoms into a core cluster of 11 commonly reported symptoms among long COVID patients and an extended cluster, that captured all other symptoms by disease domain. Patients having at least 2 symptoms persisting for &gt;=60 days that were new onset after their COVID infection, with at least one symptom in the core cluster, were labeled as having long COVID per chart review. We compared the performance of the code across three health systems and across different time periods of the pandemic. Results: A total of 900 patient charts were reviewed across 3 healthcare systems. The prevalence of long COVID among the cohort with the U09.9 ICD code, based on the operationalized WHO definition was between 23.2%-62.4% across these healthcare systems. We also evaluated a less stringent version of the WHO definition and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition and observed an increase in the prevalence of long COVID at all three healthcare systems. Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to evaluate the U09.9 code against a clinical case definition for long COVID, as well as the first to apply this definition to EHR data using a chart review approach on a nationwide cohort across multiple healthcare systems. This chart review approach can be implemented at other EHR systems to further evaluate the utility and performance of the U09.9 code.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Clinical predictive models that include race as a predictor have the potential to exacerbate disparities in healthcare. Such models can be respecified to exclude race or optimized to reduce racial bias. We investigated the impact of such respecifications in a predictive model - UTICalc - which was designed to reduce catheterizations in young children with suspected urinary tract infections. To reduce racial bias, race was removed from the UTICalc logistic regression model and replaced with two new features. We compared the two versions of UTICalc using fairness and predictive performance metrics to understand the effects on racial bias. In addition, we derived three new models for UTICalc to specifically improve racial fairness. Our results show that, as predicted by previously described impossibility results, fairness cannot be simultaneously improved on all fairness metrics, and model respecification may improve racial fairness but decrease overall predictive performance.</p>
