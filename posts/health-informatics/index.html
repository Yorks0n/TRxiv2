Working with therapeutic terminology in the field of medicine can be challenging due to both the number of ways terms can be addressed and the ambiguity associated with different naming strategies. A therapeutic concept can be identified across many facets from ontologies and vocabularies of varying focus, including natural product names, chemical structures, development codes, generic names, brand names, product formulations, or treatment regimens.">

H.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-08-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.27.23293245\nWorking with therapeutic terminology in the field of medicine can be challenging due to both the number of ways terms can be addressed and the ambiguity associated with different naming strategies. A therapeutic concept can be identified across many facets from ontologies and vocabularies of varying focus, including natural product names, chemical structures, development codes, generic names, brand names, product formulations, or treatment regimens. This diversity of nomenclature makes therapeutic terminology difficult to manage and harmonize. As the number and complexity of available therapeutic ontologies continues to increase, the need for harmonized cross-resource mappings is becoming increasingly apparent. Harmonized concept mappings will enable the linking together of like-concepts despite source-dependent differences in data structure or semantic representation. To support these mappings, we introduce TheraPy, a Python package and web API that constructs stable, searchable merged concepts for drugs and therapeutic terminologies using publicly available resources and thesauri. By using a directed graph approach, TheraPy can capture commonly used aliases, trade names, annotations, and associations for any given therapeutic and combine them under a single merged concept record. Using this approach, we found that TheraPy tends to normalize therapeutic concepts to their underlying active ingredients (excluding non-drug therapeutics, e.g. radiation therapy, biologics), and unifies all available descriptors regardless of ontological origin. In this report, we highlight the creation of 16,069 unique merged therapeutic concepts from 9 distinct sources using TheraPy. Further, we analyze rates of normalization for therapeutic terms taken from publicly available vocabularies.\nLeveraging Large Language Models for Generating Responses to Patient Messages\nAuthors: Liu, S.; McCoy, A. B.; Wright, A. P.; Carew, B.; Genkins, J. Z.; Huang, S. S.; Peterson, J. F.; Steitz, B.; Wright, A.\nScore: 19.3, Published: 2023-07-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.14.23292669\nObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and assess the performance of fine-tuned large language models for generating responses to patient messages sent via an electronic health record patient portal. MethodsUtilizing a dataset of messages and responses extracted from the patient portal at a large academic medical center, we developed a model (CLAIR-Short) based on a pre-trained large language model (LLaMA-65B). In addition, we used the OpenAI API to update physician responses from an open-source dataset into a format with informative paragraphs that offered patient education while emphasizing empathy and professionalism. By combining with this dataset, we further fine-tuned our model (CLAIR-Long). To evaluate the fine-tuned models, we used ten representative patient portal questions in primary care to generate responses. We asked primary care physicians to review generated responses from our models and ChatGPT and rated them for empathy, responsiveness, accuracy, and usefulness. ResultsThe dataset consisted of a total of 499,794 pairs of patient messages and corresponding responses from the patient portal, with 5,000 patient messages and ChatGPT-updated responses from an online platform. Four primary care physicians participated in the survey. CLAIR-Short exhibited the ability to generate concise responses similar to providers responses. CLAIR-Long responses provided increased patient educational content compared to CLAIR-Short and were rated similarly to ChatGPTs responses, receiving positive evaluations for responsiveness, empathy, and accuracy, while receiving a neutral rating for usefulness. ConclusionLeveraging large language models to generate responses to patient messages demonstrates significant potential in facilitating communication between patients and primary care providers.\n",
