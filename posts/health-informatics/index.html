However, an extensible framework for comprehensive exploratory analysis that accounts for data heterogeneity is missing. Here, we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory end-to-end analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and electronic health record data. Ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference, and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrated ehrapys features in five distinct examples: We first applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we revealed biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. Finally, we reconstructed disease state trajectories in SARS-CoV-2 patients based on imaging data. Ehrapy thus provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.\nDeep representation learning for clustering longitudinal survival data from electronic health records\nAuthors: Qiu, J.; Hu, Y.; Li, F.; Erzurumluoglu, A. M.; Braenne, I.; Whitehurst, C.; Schmitz, J.; de Jong, J.\nScore: 1.5, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.24301148\nPrecision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets has provided major opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning in mining such complex datasets for identifying novel disease subtypes. However, disease subtypes often exist in the context of certain disease-relevant risk events, and current efforts have been limited by analyzing clustering and event risk independently, resulting in subgroups that still display great heterogeneity in event risk and/or underlying molecular mechanisms. To address this problem, we developed TransVarSur (Transformer Variational Survival modeling). TransVarSur integrates a Transformer-based Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder with time-to-event modeling to capture complex relationships between cluster-specific EHR trajectories and survival times. We validated TransVarSur by showing superior performance relative to baseline methods, on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known ground-truth clustering. We then applied TransVarSur to 1908 Crohn's disease patients from the UK Biobank and successfully identified four clusters displaying both divergent EHR trajectories and divergent progression towards the risk event intestinal obstruction. A further analysis of the clusters revealed known clinical and genetic factors relevant in Crohn's disease and progression to intestinal obstruction. In conclusion, we demonstrated TransVarSur's ability to accurately stratify a patient population into clinically relevant, risk-associated subgroups. Hence, it can be a powerful tool in the development of precision medicine approaches.\nApplying Multimodal Data Fusion based on Deep Learning Methods for the Diagnosis of Neglected Tropical Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nAuthors: Minyilu, Y.; Yimer, M. A.; Meshesha, M.\nScore: 1.4, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.24300957\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are the most prevalent diseases worldwide affecting one tenth of the world population. Although there are multiple approaches to diagnose these diseases, using skin manifestations and lesions caused as a result of these diseases along with other medical records is the preferred method. This fact triggers the need to explore and implement a deep learning -based diagnostic model using multimodal data fusion (MMDF) techniques to enhance the diagnostic process. This paper, thus, endeavored to present a thorough systematic review of studies regarding the implementation of MMDF techniques for the diagnoses of skin related NTDs. To achieve its objective, the study used the PRISMA method based on predefined questions and collected 427 articles from seven major and reputed sources and critically appraised each article. Although there are studies that demonstrate the utilization of deep learning methods for the diagnoses of NTDs, no previous studies were found regarding the implementation of MMDF for the diagnoses of skin related NTDs. Similar studies using MMDF for the diagnoses of other skin diseases, such as skin cancer, were collected and analyzed in this review to extract information about the implementation of these methods. In doing so, various studies are analyzed using six different parameters including research approaches, disease selected for diagnosis, dataset, algorithms, performance achievements and future directions. Accordingly, although all the studies analyzed used diverse research methods and datasets based on their problem, deep learning -based convolutional neural network algorithms are the most frequently used and best performing model in all studies reviewed.\nHuman versus Artificial Intelligence: ChatGPT-4 Outperforming Bing, Bard, ChatGPT-3.5, and Humans in Clinical Chemistry Multiple-Choice Questions\nAuthors: Sallam, M.; Al-Salahat, K.; Eid, H.; Egger, J.; Puladi, B.\nScore: 1.0, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.08.24300995\nThe advances in large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots based on LLMs excel in language understanding and generation, with potential utility to transform healthcare education and practice. However, it is important to assess the performance of such AI models in various topics to highlight its strengths and possible limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), Bing, and Bard compared to human students at a postgraduate masters (MSc) level in Medical Laboratory Sciences. The study design was based on the METRICS checklist for the design and reporting of AI-based studies in healthcare. The study utilized a dataset of 60 Clinical Chemistry multiple-choice questions (MCQs) initially conceived for assessment of 20 MSc students. The revised Blooms taxonomy was used as the framework for classifying the MCQs into four cognitive categories: Remember, Understand, Analyze, and Apply. A modified version of the CLEAR tool was used for assessment of the quality of AI-generated content, with Cohens {kappa} for inter-rater agreement. Compared to the mean students score which was 40/60 (66.8%), GPT-4 scored 54/60 (90.0%), followed by Bing (46/60, 76.7%), GPT-3.5 (44/60, 73.3%), and Bard (40/60, 66.7%). Statistically significant better performance was noted in lower cognitive domains (Remember and Understand) in GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard. The CLEAR scores indicated that ChatGPT-4 performance was \"Excellent\" compared to \"Above average\" performance of ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard. The findings indicated that ChatGPT-4 excelled in the Clinical Chemistry exam, while ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard were above-average. Given that the MCQs were directed to postgraduate students with a high degree of specialization, the performance of these AI chatbots was remarkable. Due to the risks of academic dishonesty and possible dependence on these AI models, the appropriateness of MCQs as an assessment tool in higher education should be re-evaluated.\nEvaluating and Improving the Performance and Racial Fairness of Algorithms for GFR Estimation\nAuthors: Zhang, L.; Richter, L. R.; Kim, T.; Hripcsak, G.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-09 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.07.24300943\nData-driven clinical prediction algorithms are used widely by clinicians. Understanding what factors can impact the performance and fairness of data-driven algorithms is an important step towards achieving equitable healthcare. To investigate the impact of modeling choices on the algorithmic performance and fairness, we make use of a case study to build a prediction algorithm for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on the patients electronic health record (EHR). We compare three distinct approaches for estimating GFR: CKD-EPI equations, epidemiological models, and EHR-based models. For epidemiological models and EHR-based models, four machine learning models of varying computational complexity (i.e., linear regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, and neural network) were compared. Performance metrics included root mean squared error (RMSE), median difference, and the proportion of GFR estimates within 30% of the measured GFR value (P30). Differential performance between non-African American and African American group was used to assess algorithmic fairness with respect to race. Our study showed that the variable race had a negligible effect on error, accuracy, and differential performance. Furthermore, including more relevant clinical features (e.g., common comorbidities of chronic kidney disease) and using more complex machine learning models, namely random forest regression, significantly lowered the estimation error of GFR. However, the difference in performance between African American and non-African American patients did not decrease, where the estimation error for African American patients remained consistently higher than non-African American patients, indicating that more objective patient characteristics should be discovered and included to improve algorithm performance.\nTesting federated analytics across secure data environments using differing statistical approaches on cross-disciplinary data.\nAuthors: Gallier, S.; Topham, A.; Hodson, J.; McNulty, D.; Giles, T.; Cox, S.; Chaganty, J.; Cooper, L.; Perks, S.; Quinlan, P.; Sapey, E.\nScore: 0.8, Published: 2024-01-07 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.06.23300659\nBACKGROUNDIntroducing data-driven technologies into health systems can enhance population health and streamline care delivery. The use of diverse and geographically varied data is key for tackling health and societal challenges, despite associated technical, ethical, and governance complexities. This study explored the efficacy of federated analytics using general linear models (GLMs) and machine learning (ML) models, comparing outcomes with non-federated data analysis. METHODSA Conditional Transformation Generative Adversarial Network was used to create two synthetic datasets (training set: N=10,000; test set: N=1,000), using real-world data from 381 asthma patients. To simulate a federated environment, the resulting data were distributed across nodes in a Microsoft Azure Trusted Research Environment (TRE). GLMs (one-way ANOVA) and ML models (gradient boosted decision trees) where then produced, using both federated and non-federated approaches. The consistency of predictions produced by the ML models were then compared between approaches, with predictive accuracy of the models quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). FINDINGSGLMs produced from federated data distributed between two TREs were identical to those produced using a non-federated approach. However, ML models produced by federated and non-federated approaches, and using different data distributions between TREs, were non-identical. Despite this, when applied to the test set, the classifications made by the federated models were consistent with the non-federated model in 84.7-90.4% of cases, which was similar to the consistency of repeated non-federated models (90.9-91.5%). Consequently, overall predictive accuracies for federated and non-federated models were similar (AUROC: 0.663-0.669). INTERPRETATIONThis study confirmed the robustness of GLMs utilising ANOVA within a federated framework, yielding consistent outcomes. Moreover, federated ML models demonstrated a high degree of classification agreement, with comparable accuracy to traditional non-federated models. These results highlight the viability of federated approaches for reliable and accurate data analysis in sensitive domains.\n",

Here, we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory end-to-end analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and electronic health record data. Ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference, and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrated ehrapys features in five distinct examples: We first applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we revealed biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. Finally, we reconstructed disease state trajectories in SARS-CoV-2 patients based on imaging data. Ehrapy thus provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Precision medicine can be defined as providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, and it requires the ability to identify clinically relevant patient subgroups with high accuracy. The increasing availability of large-scale electronic health records (EHR) datasets has provided major opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning in mining such complex datasets for identifying novel disease subtypes. However, disease subtypes often exist in the context of certain disease-relevant risk events, and current efforts have been limited by analyzing clustering and event risk independently, resulting in subgroups that still display great heterogeneity in event risk and/or underlying molecular mechanisms. To address this problem, we developed TransVarSur (Transformer Variational Survival modeling). TransVarSur integrates a Transformer-based Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder with time-to-event modeling to capture complex relationships between cluster-specific EHR trajectories and survival times. We validated TransVarSur by showing superior performance relative to baseline methods, on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets with known ground-truth clustering. We then applied TransVarSur to 1908 Crohn&#39;s disease patients from the UK Biobank and successfully identified four clusters displaying both divergent EHR trajectories and divergent progression towards the risk event intestinal obstruction. A further analysis of the clusters revealed known clinical and genetic factors relevant in Crohn&#39;s disease and progression to intestinal obstruction. In conclusion, we demonstrated TransVarSur&#39;s ability to accurately stratify a patient population into clinically relevant, risk-associated subgroups. Hence, it can be a powerful tool in the development of precision medicine approaches.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are the most prevalent diseases worldwide affecting one tenth of the world population. Although there are multiple approaches to diagnose these diseases, using skin manifestations and lesions caused as a result of these diseases along with other medical records is the preferred method. This fact triggers the need to explore and implement a deep learning -based diagnostic model using multimodal data fusion (MMDF) techniques to enhance the diagnostic process. This paper, thus, endeavored to present a thorough systematic review of studies regarding the implementation of MMDF techniques for the diagnoses of skin related NTDs. To achieve its objective, the study used the PRISMA method based on predefined questions and collected 427 articles from seven major and reputed sources and critically appraised each article. Although there are studies that demonstrate the utilization of deep learning methods for the diagnoses of NTDs, no previous studies were found regarding the implementation of MMDF for the diagnoses of skin related NTDs. Similar studies using MMDF for the diagnoses of other skin diseases, such as skin cancer, were collected and analyzed in this review to extract information about the implementation of these methods. In doing so, various studies are analyzed using six different parameters including research approaches, disease selected for diagnosis, dataset, algorithms, performance achievements and future directions. Accordingly, although all the studies analyzed used diverse research methods and datasets based on their problem, deep learning -based convolutional neural network algorithms are the most frequently used and best performing model in all studies reviewed.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The advances in large language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots based on LLMs excel in language understanding and generation, with potential utility to transform healthcare education and practice. However, it is important to assess the performance of such AI models in various topics to highlight its strengths and possible limitations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), Bing, and Bard compared to human students at a postgraduate masters (MSc) level in Medical Laboratory Sciences. The study design was based on the METRICS checklist for the design and reporting of AI-based studies in healthcare. The study utilized a dataset of 60 Clinical Chemistry multiple-choice questions (MCQs) initially conceived for assessment of 20 MSc students. The revised Blooms taxonomy was used as the framework for classifying the MCQs into four cognitive categories: Remember, Understand, Analyze, and Apply. A modified version of the CLEAR tool was used for assessment of the quality of AI-generated content, with Cohens {kappa} for inter-rater agreement. Compared to the mean students score which was 40/60 (66.8%), GPT-4 scored 54/60 (90.0%), followed by Bing (46/60, 76.7%), GPT-3.5 (44/60, 73.3%), and Bard (40/60, 66.7%). Statistically significant better performance was noted in lower cognitive domains (Remember and Understand) in GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard. The CLEAR scores indicated that ChatGPT-4 performance was &#34;Excellent&#34; compared to &#34;Above average&#34; performance of ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard. The findings indicated that ChatGPT-4 excelled in the Clinical Chemistry exam, while ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard were above-average. Given that the MCQs were directed to postgraduate students with a high degree of specialization, the performance of these AI chatbots was remarkable. Due to the risks of academic dishonesty and possible dependence on these AI models, the appropriateness of MCQs as an assessment tool in higher education should be re-evaluated.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Data-driven clinical prediction algorithms are used widely by clinicians. Understanding what factors can impact the performance and fairness of data-driven algorithms is an important step towards achieving equitable healthcare. To investigate the impact of modeling choices on the algorithmic performance and fairness, we make use of a case study to build a prediction algorithm for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on the patients electronic health record (EHR). We compare three distinct approaches for estimating GFR: CKD-EPI equations, epidemiological models, and EHR-based models. For epidemiological models and EHR-based models, four machine learning models of varying computational complexity (i.e., linear regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, and neural network) were compared. Performance metrics included root mean squared error (RMSE), median difference, and the proportion of GFR estimates within 30% of the measured GFR value (P30). Differential performance between non-African American and African American group was used to assess algorithmic fairness with respect to race. Our study showed that the variable race had a negligible effect on error, accuracy, and differential performance. Furthermore, including more relevant clinical features (e.g., common comorbidities of chronic kidney disease) and using more complex machine learning models, namely random forest regression, significantly lowered the estimation error of GFR. However, the difference in performance between African American and non-African American patients did not decrease, where the estimation error for African American patients remained consistently higher than non-African American patients, indicating that more objective patient characteristics should be discovered and included to improve algorithm performance.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BACKGROUNDIntroducing data-driven technologies into health systems can enhance population health and streamline care delivery. The use of diverse and geographically varied data is key for tackling health and societal challenges, despite associated technical, ethical, and governance complexities. This study explored the efficacy of federated analytics using general linear models (GLMs) and machine learning (ML) models, comparing outcomes with non-federated data analysis.

METHODSA Conditional Transformation Generative Adversarial Network was used to create two synthetic datasets (training set: N=10,000; test set: N=1,000), using real-world data from 381 asthma patients. To simulate a federated environment, the resulting data were distributed across nodes in a Microsoft Azure Trusted Research Environment (TRE). GLMs (one-way ANOVA) and ML models (gradient boosted decision trees) where then produced, using both federated and non-federated approaches. The consistency of predictions produced by the ML models were then compared between approaches, with predictive accuracy of the models quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

FINDINGSGLMs produced from federated data distributed between two TREs were identical to those produced using a non-federated approach. However, ML models produced by federated and non-federated approaches, and using different data distributions between TREs, were non-identical. Despite this, when applied to the test set, the classifications made by the federated models were consistent with the non-federated model in 84.7-90.4% of cases, which was similar to the consistency of repeated non-federated models (90.9-91.5%). Consequently, overall predictive accuracies for federated and non-federated models were similar (AUROC: 0.663-0.669).

INTERPRETATIONThis study confirmed the robustness of GLMs utilising ANOVA within a federated framework, yielding consistent outcomes. Moreover, federated ML models demonstrated a high degree of classification agreement, with comparable accuracy to traditional non-federated models. These results highlight the viability of federated approaches for reliable and accurate data analysis in sensitive domains.</p>
