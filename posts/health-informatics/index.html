N.; Shakeri, Z.; Ioannidis, J.; Topol, E.; Rajpurkar, P.\nScore: 93.2, Published: 2023-09-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.12.23295381\nBackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with numerous studies indicating its potential to perform as well or better than clinicians. However, a considerable portion of these AI models have only been tested retrospectively, raising concerns about their true effectiveness and potential risks in real-world clinical settings. MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving AI algorithms used in various clinical practice fields and locations, published between January 1, 2018, and August 18, 2023. Our study included 84 trials and focused specifically on evaluating intervention characteristics, study endpoints, and trial outcomes, including the potential of AI to improve care management, patient behavior and symptoms, and clinical decision-making. ResultsOur analysis revealed that 82{middle dot}1% (69/84) of trials reported positive results for their primary endpoint, highlighting AIs potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare. Trials predominantly evaluated deep learning systems for medical imaging and were conducted in single-center settings. The US and China had the most trials, with gastroenterology being the most common field of study. However, we also identified areas requiring further research, such as multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, to better understand AIs true impact and limitations in healthcare. ConclusionThe existing landscape of RCTs on AI in clinical practice demonstrates an expanding interest in applying AI across a range of fields and locations. While most trials report positive outcomes, more comprehensive research, including multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, is essential to fully understand AIs impact and limitations in healthcare.\nVoice-Enabled Response Analysis Agent (VERAA): Leveraging Large Language Models to Map Voice Responses in SDoH Survey\nAuthors: Krishnamoorthy, R.; Nagarajan, V.; Pour, H.; Shashikumar, S.; Boussina, A.; Farcas, E.; Nemati, S.; Josef, C. S.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2023-09-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.25.23295917\nSocial Determinants of Health (SDoH) have been shown to have profound impacts on health-related outcomes, yet this data suffers from high rates of missingness in electronic health records (EHR). Moreover, limited English proficiency in the United States can be a barrier to communication with health care providers. In this study, we have designed a multilingual conversational agent capable of conducting SDoH surveys for use in healthcare environments. The agent asks questions in the patients native language, translates responses into English, and subsequently maps these responses via a large language model (LLM) to structured options in a SDoH survey. This tool can be extended to a variety of survey instruments in either hospital or home settings, enabling the extraction of structured insights from free-text answers. The proposed approach heralds a shift towards more inclusive and insightful data collection, marking a significant stride in SDoH data enrichment for optimizing health outcome predictions and interventions.\nA novel framework for assessing causal effect of microbiome on health: long-term antibiotic usage as pseudo-randomizer\nAuthors: Taba, N.; Fischer, K.; Org, E.; Aasmets, O.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295831\nGut microbiome (MB) has been widely shown to affect human health. Since MB in turn can be altered by various exposures, such as diet and medications, it holds immense potential for future treatments and healthy ageing. On the one hand, faecal microbiota transplantation and Mendelian Randomization have proven a causal link between treatment, MB and diseases. On the other hand, assessing the causality of the MB effects on health has remained challenging, since randomised trials in human subjects are often unethical or difficult to pursue, and Mendelian Randomization lacks valid instruments. Thus, novel analytical approaches are needed for inferring causal associations. To overcome these barriers, we propose a novel framework of antibiotic instrumental variable regression (AB-IVR) for estimating the causal relationships between MB and various diseases. Our inspiration originates from the popular Mendelian Randomization method that uses genetic mutations as instruments in the instrumental variable analysis (IVR). Further, we rely on the recently shown results that antibiotic (AB) treatment has a cumulative long-term effect on MB, consequently pseudo-randomizing individuals with higher AB usage to have more perturbed MB. Thus, we developed a new AB-IVR framework to utilise the long-term AB usage as an instrument in the IVR for assessing the causal effect of MB on health. We pursued a plethora of sensitivity analyses to explore the properties of our method: varying the samples age group and maximum number of AB used; using a buffer-time for incident disease outcomes to account for feedback-mechanism; using subgroups of AB as instrument; and simulating data for disease outcomes. We detected several interesting causal effects of MB on health outcomes; some causal effects - such as MB effects on migraine, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and several more - remain significant irrespective of the sensitivity analysis used. We believe that our AB-IVR framework has promising potential to be the new widely used method for assessing MB effect on health.\n",

Further, we rely on the recently shown results that antibiotic (AB) treatment has a cumulative long-term effect on MB, consequently pseudo-randomizing individuals with higher AB usage to have more perturbed MB. Thus, we developed a new AB-IVR framework to utilise the long-term AB usage as an instrument in the IVR for assessing the causal effect of MB on health.

We pursued a plethora of sensitivity analyses to explore the properties of our method: varying the samples age group and maximum number of AB used; using a buffer-time for incident disease outcomes to account for feedback-mechanism; using subgroups of AB as instrument; and simulating data for disease outcomes. We detected several interesting causal effects of MB on health outcomes; some causal effects - such as MB effects on migraine, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and several more - remain significant irrespective of the sensitivity analysis used. We believe that our AB-IVR framework has promising potential to be the new widely used method for assessing MB effect on health.</p>
