However, a considerable portion of these AI models have only been tested retrospectively, raising concerns about their true effectiveness and potential risks in real-world clinical settings. MethodsWe conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving AI algorithms used in various clinical practice fields and locations, published between January 1, 2018, and August 18, 2023. Our study included 84 trials and focused specifically on evaluating intervention characteristics, study endpoints, and trial outcomes, including the potential of AI to improve care management, patient behavior and symptoms, and clinical decision-making. ResultsOur analysis revealed that 82{middle dot}1% (69/84) of trials reported positive results for their primary endpoint, highlighting AIs potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare. Trials predominantly evaluated deep learning systems for medical imaging and were conducted in single-center settings. The US and China had the most trials, with gastroenterology being the most common field of study. However, we also identified areas requiring further research, such as multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, to better understand AIs true impact and limitations in healthcare. ConclusionThe existing landscape of RCTs on AI in clinical practice demonstrates an expanding interest in applying AI across a range of fields and locations. While most trials report positive outcomes, more comprehensive research, including multi-center trials and diverse outcome measures, is essential to fully understand AIs impact and limitations in healthcare.\nA novel framework for assessing causal effect of microbiome on health: long-term antibiotic usage as pseudo-randomizer\nAuthors: Taba, N.; Fischer, K.; Org, E.; Aasmets, O.\nScore: 3.5, Published: 2023-09-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.20.23295831\nGut microbiome (MB) has been widely shown to affect human health. Since MB in turn can be altered by various exposures, such as diet and medications, it holds immense potential for future treatments and healthy ageing. On the one hand, faecal microbiota transplantation and Mendelian Randomization have proven a causal link between treatment, MB and diseases. On the other hand, assessing the causality of the MB effects on health has remained challenging, since randomised trials in human subjects are often unethical or difficult to pursue, and Mendelian Randomization lacks valid instruments. Thus, novel analytical approaches are needed for inferring causal associations. To overcome these barriers, we propose a novel framework of antibiotic instrumental variable regression (AB-IVR) for estimating the causal relationships between MB and various diseases. Our inspiration originates from the popular Mendelian Randomization method that uses genetic mutations as instruments in the instrumental variable analysis (IVR). Further, we rely on the recently shown results that antibiotic (AB) treatment has a cumulative long-term effect on MB, consequently pseudo-randomizing individuals with higher AB usage to have more perturbed MB. Thus, we developed a new AB-IVR framework to utilise the long-term AB usage as an instrument in the IVR for assessing the causal effect of MB on health. We pursued a plethora of sensitivity analyses to explore the properties of our method: varying the sample's age group and maximum number of AB used; using a buffer-time for incident disease outcomes to account for feedback-mechanism; using subgroups of AB as instrument; and simulating data for disease outcomes. We detected several interesting causal effects of MB on health outcomes; some causal effects - such as MB effects on migraine, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and several more - remain significant irrespective of the sensitivity analysis used. We believe that our AB-IVR framework has promising potential to be the new widely used method for assessing MB effect on health.\nAutomatic Population of the Case Report Forms for an International Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAuthors: King, A. J.; Higgins, L.; Au, C.; Malakouti, S.; Music, E.; Kalchthaler, K.; Clermont, G.; Garrard, W.; Huang, D. T.; McVerry, B. J.; Seymour, C. W.; Linstrum, K.; McNamara, A.; Green, C.; Loar, I. D.; Roberts, T.; Marroquin, O.; Angus, D. C.; Horvat, C. M.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.19.23295797\nObjectivesTo automatically populate the case report forms (CRFs) for an international, pragmatic, multifactorial, response-adaptive, Bayesian COVID-19 platform trial. MethodsThe locations of focus included 27 hospitals and 2 large electronic health record (EHR) instances (1 Cerner Millennium and 1 Epic) that are part of the same health system in the United States. This paper describes our efforts to use EHR data to automatically populate four of the trials forms: baseline, daily, discharge, and response-adaptive randomization. ResultsBetween April 2020 and May 2022, 417 patients from the UPMC health system were enrolled in the trial. A MySQL-based extract, transform, and load pipeline automatically populated 499 of 526 CRF variables. The populated forms were statistically and manually reviewed and then reported to the trials international data coordinating center. ConclusionsWe accomplished automatic population of CRFs in a large platform trial and made recommendations for improving this process for future trials.\nMechanisms for Integrating Real Data into Search Game Simulations: An Application to Winter Health Service Pressures and Preventative Policies\nAuthors: Chapman, M.; G-Medhin, A.; Daneshi, K.; Bramwell, T.; Durbaba, S.; Curcin, V.; Parmar, D.; Boulding, H.; Becares, L.; Morgan, C.; Molokhia, M.; McBurney, P.; Harding, S.; Wolfe, I.; Ashworth, M.; Poston, L.\nScore: 1.1, Published: 2023-09-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.09.14.23295499\nWhile modelling and simulation are powerful techniques for exploring complex phenomena, if they are not coupled with suitable real-world data any results obtained are likely to require extensive validation. We consider this problem in the context of search game modelling, and suggest that both demographic and behaviour data are used to configure certain model parameters. We show this integration in practice by using a combined dataset of over 150,000 individuals to configure a specific search game model that captures the environment, population, interventions and individual behaviours relating to winter health service pressures. The presence of this data enables us to more accurately explore the potential impact of service pressure interventions, which we do across 33,000 simulations using a computational version of the model. We find government advice to be the best-performing intervention in simulation, in respect of improved health, reduced health inequalities, and thus reduced pressure on health service utilisation.\n",

        <p class="abstract">ObjectivesTo automatically populate the case report forms (CRFs) for an international, pragmatic, multifactorial, response-adaptive, Bayesian COVID-19 platform trial.

MethodsThe locations of focus included 27 hospitals and 2 large electronic health record (EHR) instances (1 Cerner Millennium and 1 Epic) that are part of the same health system in the United States. This paper describes our efforts to use EHR data to automatically populate four of the trials forms: baseline, daily, discharge, and response-adaptive randomization.

ResultsBetween April 2020 and May 2022, 417 patients from the UPMC health system were enrolled in the trial. A MySQL-based extract, transform, and load pipeline automatically populated 499 of 526 CRF variables. The populated forms were statistically and manually reviewed and then reported to the trials international data coordinating center.

ConclusionsWe accomplished automatic population of CRFs in a large platform trial and made recommendations for improving this process for future trials.</p>

        <p class="abstract">While modelling and simulation are powerful techniques for exploring complex phenomena, if they are not coupled with suitable real-world data any results obtained are likely to require extensive validation. We consider this problem in the context of search game modelling, and suggest that both demographic and behaviour data are used to configure certain model parameters. We show this integration in practice by using a combined dataset of over 150,000 individuals to configure a specific search game model that captures the environment, population, interventions and individual behaviours relating to winter health service pressures. The presence of this data enables us to more accurately explore the potential impact of service pressure interventions, which we do across 33,000 simulations using a computational version of the model. We find government advice to be the best-performing intervention in simulation, in respect of improved health, reduced health inequalities, and thus reduced pressure on health service utilisation.</p>
