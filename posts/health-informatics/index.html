ME/CFS has no curative treatment and no single diagnostic test. Public health and policy decisions relevant to ME/CFS require knowledge of its prevalence and barriers to diagnosis. However, people with ME/CFS report lengthy diagnostic delays and widespread misunderstanding of their symptoms. Published prevalence estimates vary greatly by country, gender, age and ethnicity. MethodsHospital Episode Statistics data is routinely collected by the NHS in England together with patient age, gender and ethnicity. This data, downloaded from the Feasibility Self-Service of NHS DigiTrials, was used to stratify individuals with the ICD-10 code that best reflects ME/CFS symptoms (G93.3; \"Postviral fatigue syndrome\") according to their age, self-reported gender and ethnicity, General Practice and NHS England Integrated Care Board (ICB). ResultsIn all, 100,055 people in England had been diagnosed with ME/CFS (ICD-10:G93.3) between April 1 1989 and October 7 2023, 0.16% of all registered patients. Of these, 79,445 were females and 20,590 males, a female-to-male ratio of 3.88:1. Female relative to male prevalence peaked at about 6-to-1 in individuals fourth and fifth decades of life. Prevalence varied widely across the 42 ICBs: 0.086%-0.82% for females and 0.024%-0.21% for males. White individuals were approximately 5-fold more likely to be diagnosed with ME/CFS than others; black, Asian or Chinese ethnicities are associated with particularly low rates of ME/CFS diagnoses. This ethnicity bias is stronger than for other common diseases. Among active English GP practices, 176 (3%) had no registered ME/CFS patients. Eight ICBs (19%) each contained fewer than 8 other-than-white individuals with a G93.3 code despite their registers containing a total of 293,770 other-than-white patients. ConclusionThose who are disproportionately undiagnosed with ME/CFS are other-than-white ethnic groups, older females (\u003e60y), older males (\u003e80y), and people living in areas of multiple deprivation. The lifetime prevalence of ME/CFS for English females and males may be as high as 0.92% and 0.25%, respectively, or approximately 390,000 UK individuals overall. This improved estimate of ME/CFS prevalence allows more accurate assessment of the socioeconomic and disease burden imposed by ME/CFS.\nA deep-learning-based two-compartment predictive model (PKRNN-2CM) for vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring\nAuthors: Mao, B.; Xie, Z.; Nigo, M.; Rasmy, L.; Zhi, D.\nScore: 3.6, Published: 2024-01-31 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.30.24302025\nObjectiveVancomycin is a widely used antibiotic that requires therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for optimized individual dosage. The deep learning-based model PKRNN-1CM has shown the advantage of leveraging time series electronic health record (EHR) data for individualized estimation of vancomycin pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. While one-compartment (1CM) PK models are commonly used because of their simplicity and previous trough-based clinical practices for dose adjustment, the pre-deep learning literature suggests the superiority of two-compartment models (2CM). Motivated by this, we introduce a novel deep-learning-based approach, PKRNN-2CM, for vancomycin TDM. MethodsPKRNN-2CM combines RNN-driven PK parameter estimation with a 2CM PK model to predict vancomycin concentration trajectories. Training on both simulated data and real-world EHR data allows for a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. ResultsExperiments based on simulated data highlight PKRNN-2CMs superiority over the simpler 1CM model PKRNN-1CM (PKRNN-2CM RMSE=1.30, PKRNN-1CM RMSE=2.50). Application to real data showcases significant improvement over PKRNN-1CM (PKRNN-2CM RMSE=5.62, PKRNN-1CM RMSE=5.84, two-sample unpaired t-test p-value=0.01), with potential further gains expected with non-trough level measurements. ConclusionPKRNN-2CM is an important improvement in vancomycin TDM, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and performance compared to the PKRNN-1CM model. This deep learning model holds potential for future individualized vancomycin TDM optimization and broader application in diverse clinical scenarios.\n",
