A.; Zhang, X.; Zappia, L.; Knoll, R.; Lang, N. J.; Hetzel, L.; Virshup, I.; Sikkema, L.; Roellin, E.; Curion, F.; Eils, R.; Schiller, H. B.; Hilgendorff, A.; Theis, F.\nScore: 30.0, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299816\nWith progressive digitalization of healthcare systems worldwide, large-scale collection of electronic health records (EHRs) has become commonplace. However, an extensible framework for comprehensive exploratory analysis that accounts for data heterogeneity is missing. Here, we introduce ehrapy, a modular open-source Python framework designed for exploratory end-to-end analysis of heterogeneous epidemiology and electronic health record data. Ehrapy incorporates a series of analytical steps, from data extraction and quality control to the generation of low-dimensional representations. Complemented by rich statistical modules, ehrapy facilitates associating patients with disease states, differential comparison between patient clusters, survival analysis, trajectory inference, causal inference, and more. Leveraging ontologies, ehrapy further enables data sharing and training EHR deep learning models paving the way for foundational models in biomedical research. We demonstrated ehrapys features in five distinct examples: We first applied ehrapy to stratify patients affected by unspecified pneumonia into finer-grained phenotypes. Furthermore, we revealed biomarkers for significant differences in survival among these groups. Additionally, we quantify medication-class effects of pneumonia medications on length of stay. We further leveraged ehrapy to analyze cardiovascular risks across different data modalities. Finally, we reconstructed disease state trajectories in SARS-CoV-2 patients based on imaging data. Ehrapy thus provides a framework that we envision will standardize analysis pipelines on EHR data and serve as a cornerstone for the community.\nSARS-CoV-2 Infection is Associated with an Increase in New Diagnoses of Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorder: A Study Using the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)\nAuthors: Rahman, A.; Russell, M.; Zheng, W.; Eckrich, D.; Ahmed, I.; on behalf of the N3C Consortium, Score: 704.9, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.23299473\nAmid the ongoing global repercussions of SARS-CoV-2, its crucial to comprehend its potential long-term psychiatric effects. Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.\nA web tool for the exploration of hospital prescription data in England\nAuthors: Sanderson, T.\nScore: 16.5, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.14.23299817\nMedicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.\nAugmentation of ChatGPT with Clinician-Informed Tools Improves Performance on Medical Calculation Tasks\nAuthors: Goodell, A. J.; Chu, S. N.; Rouholiman, D.; Chu, L. F.\nScore: 2.6, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.13.23299881\nAO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPrior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the ability to answer expert-level multiple choice questions in medicine, but are limited by both their tendency to hallucinate knowledge and their inherent inadequacy in performing basic mathematical operations. Unsurprisingly, early evidence suggests that LLMs perform poorly when asked to execute common clinical calculations. Recently, it has been demonstrated that LLMs have the capability of interacting with external programs and tools, presenting a possible remedy for this limitation. In this study, we explore the ability of ChatGPT (GPT-4, November 2023) to perform medical calculations, evaluating its performance across 48 diverse clinical calculation tasks. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is an unreliable clinical calculator, delivering inaccurate responses in one-third of trials (n=212). To address this, we developed an open-source clinical calculation API (openmedcalc.org), which we then integrated with ChatGPT. We subsequently evaluated the performance of this augmented model by comparing it against standard ChatGPT using 75 clinical vignettes in three common clinical calculation tasks: Caprini VTE Risk, Wells DVT Criteria, and MELD-Na. The augmented model demonstrated a marked improvement in accuracy over unimproved ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that integration of machine-usable, clinician-informed tools can help alleviate the reliability limitations observed in medical LLMs.\nStudying social anxiety without triggering it: Establishing an age-controlled cohort of social media users for observational studies\nAuthors: Schmidt, A. L.; Gonzalez-Hernandez, G.; O'COnnor, K.; Rodriguez-Esteban, R.\nScore: 3.1, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.23299645\nBackgroundPatients of certain diseases are less likely to approach the healthcare system but remain active in social media. Young Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) patients, in particular, are a hard-to-reach population due to disease symptomatology, unmet need and age-related barriers, which makes obtaining first-hand access to patient perspectives challenging. ObjectiveTo create a curated cohort of patients from social media that report their age in the range of 13 to 25 years old and confirm having a SAD diagnosis or having received therapy for SAD, and to assess the value of the content posted by these users for observational studies of SAD. MethodsWe collected 535k posts by 118k Reddit users from the r/SocialAnxiety subreddit. We then developed precise regular expressions to extract age, diagnosis and therapy mentions. We manually annotated the full set of expressions extracted and double-annotated 5% of the age mentions and 10% of the diagnosis and therapy mentions. Using similar methodology, we identified mentions of comorbidities and substance use. ResultsOur validated cohort includes 37,073 posts by 1,102 users that meet the inclusion criteria. The age, diagnosis, and therapy mention detection had a precision of 68%, 31%, and 44%, respectively, with an inter-annotator agreement of 0.96, 0.96, and 0.78. Sixty-one percent of the users in the cohort report having one or more comorbidities on top of their SAD diagnosis (Fleisss Kappa=0.79) and 13% report a concerning use of drugs or alcohol (Fleisss Kappa=0.87). We compared the characteristics of our social media cohort to the published literature on SAD. ConclusionsPatients with SAD post actively on Reddit and their perspectives can be captured and studied directly from these data. Extracting age, therapy, substance abuse and comorbidities (and potentially other patient data) can address realworld data source biases. Thus, social media is a valuable source to create cohorts of hard-to-reach patient populations that may not enter the healthcare system.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Amid the ongoing global repercussions of SARS-CoV-2, its crucial to comprehend its potential long-term psychiatric effects. Several recent studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and subsequent mental health disorders. Our investigation joins this exploration, concentrating on Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders (SSPD). Different from other studies, we took acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19 lab negative cohorts as control groups to accurately gauge the impact of COVID-19 on SSPD. Data from 19,344,698 patients, sourced from the N3C Data Enclave platform, were methodically filtered to create propensity matched cohorts: ARDS (n = 222,337), COVID-positive (n = 219,264), and COVID-negative (n = 213,183). We systematically analyzed the hazard rate of new-onset SSPD across three distinct time intervals: 0-21 days, 22-90 days, and beyond 90 days post-infection. COVID-19 positive patients consistently exhibited a heightened hazard ratio (HR) across all intervals [0-21 days (HR: 4.6; CI: 3.7-5.7), 22-90 days (HR: 2.9; CI: 2.3 -3.8), beyond 90 days (HR: 1.7; CI: 1.5-1.)]. These are notably higher than both ARDS and COVID-19 lab-negative patients. Validations using various tests, including the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test, Wald Test, and Log-rank Test confirmed these associations. Intriguingly, our data indicated that younger individuals face a heightened risk of SSPD after contracting COVID-19, a trend not observed in the ARDS and COVID-negative groups. These results, aligned with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and earlier studies, accentuate the need for vigilant psychiatric assessment and support in the era of Long-COVID, especially among younger populations.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Medicine prescription data is a valuable resource, with the power to reveal insights into healthcare trends, cost efficiencies, and geographic disparities. In England, primary care prescription data has been openly accessible for analysis for some time through a web tool, providing significant benefits. Since 2020, the National Health Service in England has also released data on secondary care prescriptions, i.e. prescribing within hospitals. This is an important dataset, but until now has been available only in a raw form that requires considerable technical skills to be used for even the analysis of basic trends. I have built a web application that enables anyone to easily analyse trends in this data, which is available at hospitalprescriptions.genomium.org.</p>

        <p class="abstract">AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPrior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the ability to answer expert-level multiple choice questions in medicine, but are limited by both their tendency to hallucinate knowledge and their inherent inadequacy in performing basic mathematical operations. Unsurprisingly, early evidence suggests that LLMs perform poorly when asked to execute common clinical calculations. Recently, it has been demonstrated that LLMs have the capability of interacting with external programs and tools, presenting a possible remedy for this limitation. In this study, we explore the ability of ChatGPT (GPT-4, November 2023) to perform medical calculations, evaluating its performance across 48 diverse clinical calculation tasks. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is an unreliable clinical calculator, delivering inaccurate responses in one-third of trials (n=212). To address this, we developed an open-source clinical calculation API (openmedcalc.org), which we then integrated with ChatGPT. We subsequently evaluated the performance of this augmented model by comparing it against standard ChatGPT using 75 clinical vignettes in three common clinical calculation tasks: Caprini VTE Risk, Wells DVT Criteria, and MELD-Na. The augmented model demonstrated a marked improvement in accuracy over unimproved ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that integration of machine-usable, clinician-informed tools can help alleviate the reliability limitations observed in medical LLMs.</p>

        <p class="abstract">BackgroundPatients of certain diseases are less likely to approach the healthcare system but remain active in social media. Young Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) patients, in particular, are a hard-to-reach population due to disease symptomatology, unmet need and age-related barriers, which makes obtaining first-hand access to patient perspectives challenging.

ObjectiveTo create a curated cohort of patients from social media that report their age in the range of 13 to 25 years old and confirm having a SAD diagnosis or having received therapy for SAD, and to assess the value of the content posted by these users for observational studies of SAD.

MethodsWe collected 535k posts by 118k Reddit users from the r/SocialAnxiety subreddit. We then developed precise regular expressions to extract age, diagnosis and therapy mentions. We manually annotated the full set of expressions extracted and double-annotated 5% of the age mentions and 10% of the diagnosis and therapy mentions. Using similar methodology, we identified mentions of comorbidities and substance use.

ResultsOur validated cohort includes 37,073 posts by 1,102 users that meet the inclusion criteria. The age, diagnosis, and therapy mention detection had a precision of 68%, 31%, and 44%, respectively, with an inter-annotator agreement of 0.96, 0.96, and 0.78. Sixty-one percent of the users in the cohort report having one or more comorbidities on top of their SAD diagnosis (Fleisss Kappa=0.79) and 13% report a concerning use of drugs or alcohol (Fleisss Kappa=0.87). We compared the characteristics of our social media cohort to the published literature on SAD.

ConclusionsPatients with SAD post actively on Reddit and their perspectives can be captured and studied directly from these data. Extracting age, therapy, substance abuse and comorbidities (and potentially other patient data) can address realworld data source biases. Thus, social media is a valuable source to create cohorts of hard-to-reach patient populations that may not enter the healthcare system.</p>
