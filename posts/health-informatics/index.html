Evidence ReviewQuestions were derived from discussion among 4 physician experts and prior work on race-based medical misconceptions of medical trainees.

All models had examples of perpetuating race-based medicine in their responses. Models were not always consistent in their responses when asked the same question repeatedly. Conclusions and RelevanceLLMs are being proposed for use in the healthcare setting, with some models already connecting to electronic health record systems. However, this study shows that based on our findings, these LLMs could potentially cause harm by perpetuating debunked, racist concepts.\nMachine learning in medicine using JavaScript: building web apps using TensorFlow.js for interpreting biomedical datasets\nAuthors: Pires, J.

N.; Wideman, L.; Pieper, C.; Dunn, J.; Kraus, W. E.\nScore: 1.2, Published: 2023-07-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.07.07.23292363\nStudy Objective: Shiftwork increases risk for numerous chronic diseases, which is hypothesized to be linked to disruption of circadian timing of lifestyle behaviors. However, empirical data on timing of lifestyle behaviors in real-world shift workers are lacking. To address this, we characterized the regularity of timing of lifestyle behaviors in shift-working police trainees. Methods: Using a two-group observational study design (N=18), we compared lifestyle behavior timing during 6 weeks of in-class training during dayshift, followed by 6 weeks of field-based training during either dayshift or nightshift. Lifestyle behavior timing, including sleep/wake patterns, physical activity, and meals, was captured using wearable activity trackers and mobile devices. The regularity of lifestyle behavior timing was quantified as an index score, which reflects day-to-day stability on a 24h time scale: Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), Physical Activity Regularity Index (PARI) and Mealtime Regularity Index (MRI). Logistic regression was applied to these indices to develop a composite score, termed the Behavior Regularity Index (BRI). Results: Transitioning from dayshift to nightshift significantly worsened the BRI, relative to maintaining a dayshift schedule. Specifically, nightshift led to more irregular sleep/wake timing and meal timing; physical activity timing was not impacted. In contrast, maintaining a dayshift schedule did not impact regularity indices. Conclusion: Nightshift imposed irregular timing of lifestyle behaviors, which is consistent with the hypothesis that circadian disruption contributes to chronic disease risk in shift workers. How to mitigate the negative impact of shiftwork on human health as mediated by irregular timing of sleep/wake patterns and meals deserves exploration.\n",

Methods: Using a two-group observational study design (N=18), we compared lifestyle behavior timing during 6 weeks of in-class training during dayshift, followed by 6 weeks of field-based training during either dayshift or nightshift. Lifestyle behavior timing, including sleep/wake patterns, physical activity, and meals, was captured using wearable activity trackers and mobile devices. The regularity of lifestyle behavior timing was quantified as an index score, which reflects day-to-day stability on a 24h time scale: Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), Physical Activity Regularity Index (PARI) and Mealtime Regularity Index (MRI). Logistic regression was applied to these indices to develop a composite score, termed the Behavior Regularity Index (BRI). Results: Transitioning from dayshift to nightshift significantly worsened the BRI, relative to maintaining a dayshift schedule. Specifically, nightshift led to more irregular sleep/wake timing and meal timing; physical activity timing was not impacted. In contrast, maintaining a dayshift schedule did not impact regularity indices. Conclusion: Nightshift imposed irregular timing of lifestyle behaviors, which is consistent with the hypothesis that circadian disruption contributes to chronic disease risk in shift workers. How to mitigate the negative impact of shiftwork on human health as mediated by irregular timing of sleep/wake patterns and meals deserves exploration.</p>
