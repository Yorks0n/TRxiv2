Due to the small number of atoms to interact with, binding to small molecules with high affinity requires highly shape complementary pockets, and transducing binding events into signals is challenging. Here we describe an integrated deep learning and energy based approach for designing high shape complementarity binders to small molecules that are poised for downstream sensing applications. We employ deep learning generated psuedocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central pockets; depending on the geometry of the structural unit and repeat number, these pockets span wide ranges of sizes and shapes. For a small molecule target of interest, we extensively sample high shape complementarity pseudocycles to generate large numbers of customized potential binding pockets; the ligand binding poses and the interacting interfaces are then optimized for high affinity binding. We computationally design binders to four diverse molecules, including for the first time polar flexible molecules such as methotrexate and thyroxine, which are expressed at high levels and have nanomolar affinities straight out of the computer. Co-crystal structures are nearly identical to the design models. Taking advantage of the modular repeating structure of pseudocycles and central location of the binding pockets, we constructed low noise nanopore sensors and chemically induced dimerization systems by splitting the binders into domains which assemble into the original pseudocycle pocket upon target molecule addition.\nXylosyltransferase Bump-and-hole Engineering to Chemically Manipulate Proteoglycans in Mammalian Cells\nAuthors: Li, Z.; Di Vagno, L.; Ni Cheallaigh, A.; Sammon, D.; Briggs, D. C.; Chung, N.; Chang, V.; Mahoney, K. E.; Cioce, A.; Murphy, L. D.; Chen, Y.-H.; Narimatsu, Y.; Miller, R. L.; Willems, L. I.; Malaker, S. A.; Miller, G. J.; Hohenester, E.; Schumann, B.\nScore: 24.4, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572522\nMammalian cells orchestrate signalling through interaction events on their surfaces. Proteoglycans are an intricate part of these interactions, carrying large glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides that recruit signalling molecules. Despite their importance in development, cancer and neurobiology, a relatively small number of proteoglycans have been identified. In addition to the complexity of glycan extension, biosynthetic redundancy in the first protein glycosylation step by two xylosyltransferase isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 complicates annotation of proteoglycans. Here, we develop a chemical strategy that allows profiling of cellular proteoglycans. By employing a tactic termed bump-and-hole engineering, we engineer the two isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 to specifically transfer a chemically modified xylose analogue to target proteins. The chemical modification contains a bioorthogonal tag, allowing the ability to visualise and profile target proteins modified by both transferases in mammalian cells as well as pinpointing glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry. Engineered XT enzymes permit a view into proteoglycan biology that is orthogonal to conventional techniques in biochemistry.\nA broadly generalizable stabilization strategy for sarbecovirus fusion machinery vaccines\nAuthors: Lee, J.; Stewart, C.; Schaefer, A.; Leaf, E. M.; Park, Y.-J.; Asarnow, D.; Powers, J. M.; Treichel, C.; Corti, D.; Baric, R.; King, N. P.; Veesler, D.\nScore: 76.0, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.12.571160\nContinuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 alters the antigenicity of the immunodominant spike (S) receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain, undermining the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. To overcome this challenge, we set out to develop a vaccine focusing antibody responses on the highly conserved but metastable S2 subunit, which folds as a spring-loaded fusion machinery. Here, we describe a protein design strategy enabling prefusion-stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit and high yield recombinant expression of trimers with native structure and antigenicity. We demonstrate that our design strategy is broadly generalizable to all sarbecoviruses, as exemplified with the SARS-CoV-1 (clade 1a) and PRD-0038 (clade 3) S2 fusion machineries. Immunization of mice with a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S2 trimer vaccine elicits broadly reactive sarbecovirus antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers of comparable magnitude against Wuhan-Hu-1 and the immune evasive XBB.1.5 variant. Vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss and disease upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5, providing proof-of-principle for fusion machinery sarbecovirus vaccines motivating future development.\nOptimized mucin-selective enrichment strategy to probe the mucinome\nAuthors: Mahoney, K. E.; Chang, V.; Lucas, T. M.; Maruszko, K.; Malaker, S. A.\nScore: 19.7, Published: 2023-12-18 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.18.572204\nMucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in a host of healthy and diseasedriven biological functions. Previously, we developed a mucin-selective enrichment strategy by employing a catalytically inactive mucinase (StcE) conjugated to solid support. While this method was effective, it suffered from low throughput and high sample requirements. Further, the elution step required boiling in SDS, thus necessitating an in-gel digest with trypsin. Here, we optimized our previous enrichment method to include elution conditions amenable to mucinase digestion and downstream analysis with mass spectrometry. This increased throughput and lowered sample input while maintaining mucin selectivity and enhancing glycopeptide signal. We then benchmarked this technique against different O-glycan binding moieties for their ability to enrich mucins from various cell lines and human serum. Overall, the new method outperformed our previous procedure and all other enrichment techniques tested. This allowed for effective isolation of more mucin-domain glycoproteins, resulting in a high number of O-glycopeptides, thus enhancing our ability to analyze the mucinome.\nThree-step mechanism of promoter escape by RNA polymerase II\nAuthors: Zhan, Y.; Grabbe, F.; Oberbeckmann, E.; Dienemann, C.; Cramer, P.\nScore: 16.4, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572998\nThe transition from transcription initiation to elongation is highly regulated in human cells but remains incompletely understood at the structural level. In particular, it is unclear how interactions between RNA polymerase (Pol) II and initiation factors are broken to enable promoter escape. Here we reconstitute Pol II promoter escape in vitro, determine high-resolution structures of five transition intermediates, and show that promoter escape occurs in three major steps. First, the growing RNA transcript displaces the B-reader element of the initiation factor TFIIB without evicting TFIIB. Second, rewinding of the upstream edge of the growing DNA bubble evicts TFIIA, TFIIB and TBP and repositions parts of TFIIE and TFIIF. Third, binding of DSIF and NELF evicts TFIIE and TFIIH, establishing the paused elongation complex. This three-step model for promoter escape fills a gap in our understanding of the initiation-elongation transition of Pol II transcription.\nStructure of the minor spliceosomal U11 snRNP\nAuthors: Zhao, J.; Peter, D.; Brandina, I.; Liu, X.; Galej, W. P.\nScore: 15.2, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.573053\nThe minor spliceosome catalyses the excision of U12-dependent introns from pre-mRNAs. These introns are rare, but their removal is critical for cell viability. We obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the 13-subunit U11 snRNP complex, revealing structures of U11 snRNA and five minor spliceosome-specific factors. U11 snRNP appears strikingly different from the equivalent major spliceosome U1 snRNP. SNRNP25 and SNRNP35 form a dimer, which specifically recognises U11 snRNA. PDCD7 forms extended helices, which bridge SNRNP25 and SNRNP48, located at the distal ends of the particle. SNRNP48 forms multiple interfaces with U11 snRNP and, together with ZMAT5, are positioned near the 5'-end of the U11 snRNA and likely stabilise the binding of the incoming 5'-SS. Our structure provides mechanistic insights into U12-dependent intron recognition and the evolution of the splicing machinery.\nMFSD1 in complex with its accessory subunit GLMP functions as a general dipeptide uniporter in lysosomes\nAuthors: Jungnickel, K. E. J.; Guelle, O.; Iguchi, M.; Dong, W.; Kotov, V.; Gabriel, F.; Debacker, C.; Dairou, J.; McCort-Tranchepain, I.; Laqtom, N. N.; Chan, S. H.; Ejima, A.; Sato, K.; Massa Lopez, D.; Saftig, P.; Mehdipour, A. R.; Abu-Remaileh, M.; Gasnier, B.; Low, C.; Damme, M.\nScore: 22.5, Published: 2023-12-15 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.15.570541\nLysosomal degradation of macromolecules in lysosomes produces diverse small metabolites exported by specific transporters for reuse in biosynthetic pathways. Here, we deorphanized the Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 1 (MFSD1) protein, which forms a tight complex with the Glycosylated Lysosomal Membrane Protein (GLMP) in the lysosomal membrane. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of MFSD1-deficient mouse lysosomes revealed an increase in cationic dipeptides. Purified MFSD1 selectively bound diverse dipeptides, while electrophysiological, isotope tracer, and fluorescence-based studies in Xenopus oocytes and proteoliposomes showed that MFSD1/GLMP acts as a uniporter for cationic and neutral dipeptides. Cryo-EM structure of the dipeptide-bound MFSD1/GLMP complex in outward-open conformation characterized the heterodimer interface and, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provided a structural basis for its selectivity towards diverse dipeptides. Together, our data identify MFSD1 as a general lysosomal dipeptide uniporter, providing an alternative route to recycle lysosomal proteolysis products when lysosomal amino acid exporters are overloaded.\nStructural analysis of the dynamic ribosome-translocon complex\nAuthors: Lewis, A. J. O.; Hegde, R. S.\nScore: 13.8, Published: 2023-12-22 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.22.572959\nThe protein translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum comprises the Sec61 translocation channel and numerous accessory factors that collectively facilitate the biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Here, we leveraged recent advances in cryo-EM and structure prediction to derive insights into several novel configurations of the ribosome-translocon complex. We show how a transmembrane domain (TMD) in a looped configuration passes through the Sec61 lateral gate during membrane insertion; how a nascent chain can bind and constrain the conformation of ribosomal protein uL22; and how the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex can adjust its position during different stages of protein biogenesis. Most unexpectedly, we find that a large proportion of translocon complexes contains RAMP4 intercalated into Sec61's lateral gate, widening Sec61's central pore and contributing to its hydrophilic interior. These structures lead to mechanistic hypotheses for translocon function and highlight a remarkably plastic machinery whose conformations and composition adjust dynamically to its diverse range of substrates.\nMUT-7 exoribonuclease activity and localisation are mediated by an ancient domain\nAuthors: Busetto, V.; Pshanichnaya, L.; Lichtenberger, R.; Hann, S.; Ketting, R. F.; Falk, S.\nScore: 10.8, Published: 2023-12-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.20.572533\nThe MUT-7 family of 3-5 exoribonucleases is evolutionarily conserved across the animal kingdom and plays essential roles in small RNA production in the germline. Most MUT-7 homologs carry a C-terminal domain of unknown function named MUT7-C appended to the exoribonuclease domain. Our analysis shows that the MUT7-C is evolutionary ancient, as a minimal version of the domain exists as an individual protein in prokaryotes. In animals, MUT7-C has acquired an insertion that diverged during evolution, expanding its functions. C. elegans MUT-7 contains a specific insertion within MUT7-C, which allows binding to MUT-8 and, consequently, MUT-7 recruitment to germ granules. In addition, in C. elegans and human MUT-7, the MUT7-C domain contributes to RNA binding and is thereby crucial for nuclease activity. This RNA-binding function most likely represents the ancestral function of the MUT7-C domain. Overall, this study sheds light on MUT7-C and assigns two functions to this previously uncharacterised domain.\nA new GUV-based assay to reconstitute membrane tethering in vitro demonstrates the vesicle tethering ability of the selective autophagy scaffold Atg11\nAuthors: Andhare, D.; Ragusa, M. J.\nScore: 9.5, Published: 2023-12-19 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.19.572332\nMembrane tethering is essential for the generation of organelle contact sites and to anchor incoming vesicles to their target membranes before vesicle fusion. During autophagy in yeast, tethering of 30 nm vesicles to cargo is one of the first steps in the generation of the isolation membrane that engulfs the cargo to be degraded. While membrane tethering is critical for cellular function, many of the current biochemical techniques to assay for membrane tethering rely on indirect readouts and are limited in their ability to monitor protein localization at sites of tethering. As such, we developed a fluorescence-microscopy-based GUV liposome tethering assay (GLT) to directly visualize membrane tethering and monitor protein localization at tethering sites simultaneously. We initially used GLT with engineered membrane tethers to demonstrate the ease of use, versatility and sensitivity of the assay. We also demonstrated that the selective autophagy scaffolding protein Atg11 can bind, and tether negatively charged membranes but is unable to bind GUVs mimicking the charge of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Atg11 instead requires the selective autophagy receptor Atg32 to be recruited to mitochondrial membranes. Lastly, we demonstrate that Atg11 bound to Atg32 on GUVs can tether negatively charged vesicles to GUVs. Collectively, our results reconstitute one of the first steps during the initiation of mitochondrial autophagy and highlight the versatility of GLT to study a range of membrane tethering events biochemically.\n",

        <p class="abstract">A general method for designing proteins to bind and sense any small molecule of interest would be widely useful. Due to the small number of atoms to interact with, binding to small molecules with high affinity requires highly shape complementary pockets, and transducing binding events into signals is challenging. Here we describe an integrated deep learning and energy based approach for designing high shape complementarity binders to small molecules that are poised for downstream sensing applications. We employ deep learning generated psuedocycles with repeating structural units surrounding central pockets; depending on the geometry of the structural unit and repeat number, these pockets span wide ranges of sizes and shapes. For a small molecule target of interest, we extensively sample high shape complementarity pseudocycles to generate large numbers of customized potential binding pockets; the ligand binding poses and the interacting interfaces are then optimized for high affinity binding. We computationally design binders to four diverse molecules, including for the first time polar flexible molecules such as methotrexate and thyroxine, which are expressed at high levels and have nanomolar affinities straight out of the computer. Co-crystal structures are nearly identical to the design models. Taking advantage of the modular repeating structure of pseudocycles and central location of the binding pockets, we constructed low noise nanopore sensors and chemically induced dimerization systems by splitting the binders into domains which assemble into the original pseudocycle pocket upon target molecule addition.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mammalian cells orchestrate signalling through interaction events on their surfaces. Proteoglycans are an intricate part of these interactions, carrying large glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides that recruit signalling molecules. Despite their importance in development, cancer and neurobiology, a relatively small number of proteoglycans have been identified. In addition to the complexity of glycan extension, biosynthetic redundancy in the first protein glycosylation step by two xylosyltransferase isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 complicates annotation of proteoglycans. Here, we develop a chemical strategy that allows profiling of cellular proteoglycans. By employing a tactic termed bump-and-hole engineering, we engineer the two isoenzymes XT1 and XT2 to specifically transfer a chemically modified xylose analogue to target proteins. The chemical modification contains a bioorthogonal tag, allowing the ability to visualise and profile target proteins modified by both transferases in mammalian cells as well as pinpointing glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry. Engineered XT enzymes permit a view into proteoglycan biology that is orthogonal to conventional techniques in biochemistry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 alters the antigenicity of the immunodominant spike (S) receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain, undermining the efficacy of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. To overcome this challenge, we set out to develop a vaccine focusing antibody responses on the highly conserved but metastable S2 subunit, which folds as a spring-loaded fusion machinery. Here, we describe a protein design strategy enabling prefusion-stabilization of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit and high yield recombinant expression of trimers with native structure and antigenicity. We demonstrate that our design strategy is broadly generalizable to all sarbecoviruses, as exemplified with the SARS-CoV-1 (clade 1a) and PRD-0038 (clade 3) S2 fusion machineries. Immunization of mice with a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S2 trimer vaccine elicits broadly reactive sarbecovirus antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers of comparable magnitude against Wuhan-Hu-1 and the immune evasive XBB.1.5 variant. Vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss and disease upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5, providing proof-of-principle for fusion machinery sarbecovirus vaccines motivating future development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Mucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in a host of healthy and diseasedriven biological functions. Previously, we developed a mucin-selective enrichment strategy by employing a catalytically inactive mucinase (StcE) conjugated to solid support. While this method was effective, it suffered from low throughput and high sample requirements. Further, the elution step required boiling in SDS, thus necessitating an in-gel digest with trypsin. Here, we optimized our previous enrichment method to include elution conditions amenable to mucinase digestion and downstream analysis with mass spectrometry. This increased throughput and lowered sample input while maintaining mucin selectivity and enhancing glycopeptide signal. We then benchmarked this technique against different O-glycan binding moieties for their ability to enrich mucins from various cell lines and human serum. Overall, the new method outperformed our previous procedure and all other enrichment techniques tested. This allowed for effective isolation of more mucin-domain glycoproteins, resulting in a high number of O-glycopeptides, thus enhancing our ability to analyze the mucinome.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The transition from transcription initiation to elongation is highly regulated in human cells but remains incompletely understood at the structural level. In particular, it is unclear how interactions between RNA polymerase (Pol) II and initiation factors are broken to enable promoter escape. Here we reconstitute Pol II promoter escape in vitro, determine high-resolution structures of five transition intermediates, and show that promoter escape occurs in three major steps. First, the growing RNA transcript displaces the B-reader element of the initiation factor TFIIB without evicting TFIIB. Second, rewinding of the upstream edge of the growing DNA bubble evicts TFIIA, TFIIB and TBP and repositions parts of TFIIE and TFIIF. Third, binding of DSIF and NELF evicts TFIIE and TFIIH, establishing the paused elongation complex. This three-step model for promoter escape fills a gap in our understanding of the initiation-elongation transition of Pol II transcription.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The minor spliceosome catalyses the excision of U12-dependent introns from pre-mRNAs. These introns are rare, but their removal is critical for cell viability. We obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the 13-subunit U11 snRNP complex, revealing structures of U11 snRNA and five minor spliceosome-specific factors. U11 snRNP appears strikingly different from the equivalent major spliceosome U1 snRNP. SNRNP25 and SNRNP35 form a dimer, which specifically recognises U11 snRNA. PDCD7 forms extended helices, which bridge SNRNP25 and SNRNP48, located at the distal ends of the particle. SNRNP48 forms multiple interfaces with U11 snRNP and, together with ZMAT5, are positioned near the 5&#39;-end of the U11 snRNA and likely stabilise the binding of the incoming 5&#39;-SS. Our structure provides mechanistic insights into U12-dependent intron recognition and the evolution of the splicing machinery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Lysosomal degradation of macromolecules in lysosomes produces diverse small metabolites exported by specific transporters for reuse in biosynthetic pathways. Here, we deorphanized the Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 1 (MFSD1) protein, which forms a tight complex with the Glycosylated Lysosomal Membrane Protein (GLMP) in the lysosomal membrane. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of MFSD1-deficient mouse lysosomes revealed an increase in cationic dipeptides. Purified MFSD1 selectively bound diverse dipeptides, while electrophysiological, isotope tracer, and fluorescence-based studies in Xenopus oocytes and proteoliposomes showed that MFSD1/GLMP acts as a uniporter for cationic and neutral dipeptides. Cryo-EM structure of the dipeptide-bound MFSD1/GLMP complex in outward-open conformation characterized the heterodimer interface and, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, provided a structural basis for its selectivity towards diverse dipeptides. Together, our data identify MFSD1 as a general lysosomal dipeptide uniporter, providing an alternative route to recycle lysosomal proteolysis products when lysosomal amino acid exporters are overloaded.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The protein translocon at the endoplasmic reticulum comprises the Sec61 translocation channel and numerous accessory factors that collectively facilitate the biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Here, we leveraged recent advances in cryo-EM and structure prediction to derive insights into several novel configurations of the ribosome-translocon complex. We show how a transmembrane domain (TMD) in a looped configuration passes through the Sec61 lateral gate during membrane insertion; how a nascent chain can bind and constrain the conformation of ribosomal protein uL22; and how the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex can adjust its position during different stages of protein biogenesis. Most unexpectedly, we find that a large proportion of translocon complexes contains RAMP4 intercalated into Sec61&#39;s lateral gate, widening Sec61&#39;s central pore and contributing to its hydrophilic interior. These structures lead to mechanistic hypotheses for translocon function and highlight a remarkably plastic machinery whose conformations and composition adjust dynamically to its diverse range of substrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The MUT-7 family of 3-5 exoribonucleases is evolutionarily conserved across the animal kingdom and plays essential roles in small RNA production in the germline. Most MUT-7 homologs carry a C-terminal domain of unknown function named MUT7-C appended to the exoribonuclease domain. Our analysis shows that the MUT7-C is evolutionary ancient, as a minimal version of the domain exists as an individual protein in prokaryotes. In animals, MUT7-C has acquired an insertion that diverged during evolution, expanding its functions. C. elegans MUT-7 contains a specific insertion within MUT7-C, which allows binding to MUT-8 and, consequently, MUT-7 recruitment to germ granules. In addition, in C. elegans and human MUT-7, the MUT7-C domain contributes to RNA binding and is thereby crucial for nuclease activity. This RNA-binding function most likely represents the ancestral function of the MUT7-C domain. Overall, this study sheds light on MUT7-C and assigns two functions to this previously uncharacterised domain.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Membrane tethering is essential for the generation of organelle contact sites and to anchor incoming vesicles to their target membranes before vesicle fusion. During autophagy in yeast, tethering of 30 nm vesicles to cargo is one of the first steps in the generation of the isolation membrane that engulfs the cargo to be degraded. While membrane tethering is critical for cellular function, many of the current biochemical techniques to assay for membrane tethering rely on indirect readouts and are limited in their ability to monitor protein localization at sites of tethering. As such, we developed a fluorescence-microscopy-based GUV liposome tethering assay (GLT) to directly visualize membrane tethering and monitor protein localization at tethering sites simultaneously. We initially used GLT with engineered membrane tethers to demonstrate the ease of use, versatility and sensitivity of the assay. We also demonstrated that the selective autophagy scaffolding protein Atg11 can bind, and tether negatively charged membranes but is unable to bind GUVs mimicking the charge of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Atg11 instead requires the selective autophagy receptor Atg32 to be recruited to mitochondrial membranes. Lastly, we demonstrate that Atg11 bound to Atg32 on GUVs can tether negatively charged vesicles to GUVs. Collectively, our results reconstitute one of the first steps during the initiation of mitochondrial autophagy and highlight the versatility of GLT to study a range of membrane tethering events biochemically.</p>
