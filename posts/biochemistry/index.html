G.\nScore: 39.4, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569287\nCas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments. However, in vitro studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg2+ concentrations that would be present in cells. By profiling the specificity of Cas12a orthologs at a range of Mg2+ concentrations, we find that Cas12a switches its specificity depending on metal ion concentration. Lowering Mg2+ concentration decreases cleavage defects caused by seed mismatches, while increasing the defects caused by PAM-distal mismatches. We show that Cas12a can unwind and bind seed mutant targets more rapidly at low Mg2+ concentrations, resulting in faster cleavage. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches cause substantial defects in cleavage following formation of the Cas12a-target complex at low Mg2+ concentrations. We observe differences in Cas12a specificity switching between three orthologs that results in variations in the routes of phage escape from Cas12a-mediated immunity. Overall, our results reveal the importance of physiological metal ion conditions on the specificity of Cas effectors that are used in different cellular environments.\nCK-666 and CK-869 differentially inhibit Arp2/3 iso-complexes\nAuthors: Cao, L.; Huang, S.; Basant, A.; Mladenov, M.; Way, M.\nScore: 24.0, Published: 2023-11-26 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568719\nThe inhibitors, CK-666 and CK-869, are widely used to probe the function of actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex in vitro and in cells. However, in mammals, the Arp2/3 complex consists of 8 iso-complexes, as three of its subunits (Arp3, ArpC1, ArpC5) are encoded by two different genes. Here, we used recombinant complexes with defined subunit composition to assess the activity of CK-666 and CK-869 against iso-complexes. We demonstrate that while both inhibitors prevent linear actin filament formation when either ArpC1A- or ArpC1B-containing complexes are activated by SPIN90, inhibition of actin branching depends on iso-complex composition. Both drugs inhibited actin branch formation by VCA-activated complexes containing ArpC1A, but only CK-869 can inhibit ArpC1B-containing complexes. Consistent with this, in bone marrow-derived macrophages which express very low levels of ArpC1A, CK-869 but not CK-666, impacted phagocytosis and migration. We also found that CK-869 is only able to inhibit Arp3-but not Arp3B-containing iso-complexes. Our analyses have important implications for the interpretation of results using CK-666 and CK-869, given that the relative expression levels of ArpC1 and Arp3 isoforms in cells and tissues remains largely unknown.\nA targeted metabolomic method to detect epigenetically relevant metabolites\nAuthors: Miro-Blanch, J.; Junza, A.; Capellades, J.; Balvay, A.; Moudet, C.; Kovatcheva, M.; Raineri, S.; Rabot, S.; Mellor, J.; Serrano, M.; Yanes, O.\nScore: 23.4, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569455\nMetabolites play a central role in the chemical crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetic marks. Epigenetically relevant metabolites are substrates, products and cofactors that can act as activators or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes, which control gene expression by adding or removing chemical marks in the DNA, RNA and histones. Diet composition, and biosynthetic pathways encoded in the gut microbiome and the host genome are the main sources of these metabolites for mammals. Despite the increasing interest in the study of the \"microbiota-nutrient metabolism-host epigenetic axis\" to understand health and disease, there is a lack of a sensitive and easy analytical method to detect epigenetically relevant metabolites simultaneously. Here, we show an straightforward biphasic extraction where the organic phase is directly analyzed by GC-EI MS to detect short-chain fatty acids and formate without chemical derivatization, and the aqueous phase is analyzed by HILIC coupled to ESI-MS/MS, which together can cover \u003e30 epigenetically relevant metabolites in biological samples such as liver, plasma or feces. In addition, we propose a stable isotope tracing method based on multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions by LC-QqQ MS to understand how 13C-labeled glucose or glutamine are used to build SAM and acetyl-CoA, the main methyl and acetyl group donors in epigenetic modifications, respectively. We anticipate that our methods will complement epigenomic and proteomic analyses adding another layer of molecular information towards mechanistic insights.\nStructure of the γ-tubulin ring complex-capped microtubule\nAuthors: Aher, A.; Urnavicius, L.; Xue, A.; Neselu, K.; Kapoor, T.\nScore: 38.5, Published: 2023-11-20 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.20.567916\nMicrotubules are composed of /{beta}-tubulin dimers positioned head-to-tail to form protofilaments that associate laterally in varying numbers. It is not known how cellular microtubules assemble with the canonical 13-protofilament architecture, resulting in micrometer-scale /{beta}-tubulin tracks for intracellular transport that align with, rather than spiral along, the filaments long-axis. We report that the human [~]2.3MDa {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}-TuRC), an essential regulator of microtubule formation that contains 14 {gamma}-tubulins, selectively nucleates 13-protofilament microtubules. Cryo-EM reconstructions of {gamma}-TuRC-capped microtubule minus-ends reveal the extensive intra- and inter-domain motions of {gamma}-TuRC subunits that accommodate its actin-containing luminal bridge and establish lateral and longitudinal interactions between {gamma}- and -tubulins. Our structures reveal how free {gamma}-TuRC, an inefficient nucleation template due to its splayed conformation, transforms into a stable cap that blocks addition or loss of /{beta}-tubulins from minus-ends and sets the lattice architecture of cellular microtubules. One Sentence SummaryStructural insights into how the {gamma}-tubulin ring complex nucleates and caps a 13-protofilament microtubule.\nBioorthogonal metabolic labeling of the virulence factor phenolic glycolipid in mycobacteria\nAuthors: Guzman, L. E.; Cambier, C.; Cheng, T.-Y.; Naqvi, K. F.; Shiloh, M. U.; Moody, D. B.; Bertozzi, C.\nScore: 13.1, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.28.569059\nSurface lipids on pathogenic mycobacteria modulate infection outcomes by regulating host immune responses. Phenolic glycolipid (PGL) is a host-modulating surface lipid that varies among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. PGL is also found in Mycobacterium marinum where it promotes infection of zebrafish through effects on the innate immune system. Given the important role this lipid plays in the host-pathogen relationship, tools for profiling its abundance, spatial distribution, and dynamics are needed. Here we report a strategy for imaging PGL in live mycobacteria using bioorthogonal metabolic labeling. We functionalized the PGL precursor p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHB) with an azide group (3-azido pHB). When fed to mycobacteria, 3-azido pHB was incorporated into the cell surface, which could then be visualized via bioorthogonal conjugation of a fluorescent probe. We confirmed that 3-azido pHB incorporates into PGL using mass spectrometry methods and demonstrated selectivity for PGL-producing Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Finally, we applied this metabolic labeling strategy to study the dynamics of PGL within the mycobacterial membrane. This new tool enables visualization of PGL which may facilitate studies of mycobacterial pathogenesis.\nMotif-VI Loop Acts as a Nucleotide Valve in the West Nile Virus NS3 Helicase\nAuthors: Roy, P.; Walter, Z.; Berish, L.; Ramage, H.; McCullagh, M.\nScore: 5.5, Published: 2023-11-30 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569434\nThe flavivirus NS3 helicase (NS3h), a highly conserved protein, plays a pivotal role in virus replication and thus represents a potential drug target for flavivirus pathogenesis. NS3h utilizes nucleotide triphosphate, such as ATP, for hydrolysis energy (ATPase) to translocate on single-stranded nucleic acids, which is an important step in the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids. The intermediate states along the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle, as well as the conformational changes between these states, represent important yet difficult-to-identify targets for potential inhibitors. We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations of apo, ATP, ADP+Pi, and ADP bound to WNV NS3h+ssRNA to model the conformational ensembles along this cycle. Energetic and structural clustering analyses on these trajectories depict a clear trend of differential enthalpic affinity of NS3h with ADP, demonstrating a probable mechanism of hydrolysis turnover regulated by the motif-VI loop (MVIL). These findings were experimentally corroborated using viral replicons encoding three mutations at the D471 position. Replication assays using these mutants demonstrated a substantial reduction in viral replication compared to the wild-type. Molecular simulations of the D471 mutants in the apo state indicate a shift in MVIL populations favoring either a closed or open valve conformation, affecting ATP entry or stabilization, respectively. Combining our molecular modeling with experimental evidence highlights a conformation-dependent role for MVIL as a valve for the ATP-pocket, presenting a promising target for antiviral development.\nStructural snapshots of phenuivirus cap-snatching and transcription\nAuthors: Williams, H. M.; Thorkelsson, S. R.; Vogel, D.; Busch, C.; Milewski, M.; Cusack, S.; Grunewald, K.; Quemin, E. R. J.; Rosenthal, M.\nScore: 5.1, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569195\nSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a human pathogen that is now endemic to several East Asian countries. The viral large (L) protein catalyzes viral transcription by stealing host mRNA caps via a process known as cap-snatching. Here, we establish an in vitro cap-snatching assay and present three high-quality electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the SFTSV L protein in biologically relevant, transcription-specific states. In a priming-state structure, we show capped RNA bound to the L protein cap-binding domain (CBD). The L protein conformation in this priming structure is significantly different from published replication-state structures, in particular the N- and C-terminal domains. The capped-RNA is positioned in a way that it can feed directly into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) ready for elongation. We also captured the L protein in an early-elongation state following primer-incorporation demonstrating that this priming conformation is retained at least in the very early stages of primer extension. This structural data is complemented by in vitro biochemical and cell-based assays. Together, these insights further our mechanistic understanding of how SFTSV and other bunyaviruses incorporate stolen host mRNA fragments into their viral transcripts thereby allowing the virus to hijack host cell translation machinery.\nPhytopathogenic cyclic glucohexadecaose from an inverting transglycosylase\nAuthors: Motouchi, S.; Komba, S.; Nakai, H.; Nakajima, M.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2023-11-27 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.26.568766\nXanthomonas species contain numerous notoriously well-known plant pathogens. Among various pathogenic factors, the role of -1,6-cyclized {beta}-1,2-glucohexadecaose (C{beta}G16) produced by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris was shown previously to be vital for infecting model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. However, enzymes responsible for biosynthesising C{beta}G16 are essentially unknown, which limits the generation of agrichemicals that inhibit C{beta}G16 synthesis. In this study, we discovered that OpgD from X. campestris pv. campestris converts linear {beta}-1,2-glucan to C{beta}G16. Structural and functional analyses revealed that OpgD from X. campestris pv. campestris possesses an anomer-inverting transglycosylation mechanism, which is unprecedented among carbohydrate-active enzymes. The discovery of this unprecedented glucan-generating mechanism reveals a new foundation for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. Furthermore, identifying C{beta}G16 synthase highly conserved in Xanthomonas provides a broadly adaptable drug target for new-genre agrichemicals that overcome antimicrobial-resistant bacterial issues.\nCyclase-associated protein is a pro-formin anti-capping processive depolymerase of actin barbed and pointed ends\nAuthors: Towsif, E. M.; Shekhar, S.\nScore: 4.1, Published: 2023-12-01 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.30.569482\nCellular actin networks display distinct assembly and disassembly dynamics resulting from multicomponent reactions occurring primarily at the two ends and the sides of actin filaments. While barbed ends are considered the hotspot of actin assembly, disassembly is thought to primarily occur via reactions on filament sides and pointed ends. Cyclase-associated protein (CAP) has emerged as the main protagonist of actin disassembly and remodeling. CAP collaborates with cofilin to increase pointed-end depolymerization by 300 fold, promotes filament coalescence in presence of Abp1, and accelerates nucleotide exchange to regenerate monomers for new rounds of assembly. CAP has also been reported to enhance cofilin-mediated severing, but these claims have since been challenged. Using microfluidics-assisted three-color single-molecule imaging, we now reveal that CAP also has important functions at filament barbed ends. We reveal that CAP is a processive barbed-end depolymerase capable of tracking both ends of the filament. Each CAP binding event leads to removal of about 5,175 and 620 subunits from the barbed and pointed ends respectively. We find that the WH2 domain is essential, and the CARP domain is dispensable for barbed-end depolymerization. We show that CAP co-localizes with barbed-end bound formin and capping protein, in the process increasing residence time of formin by 10-fold and promoting dissociation of CP by 4-fold. Our barbed-end observations combined with previously reported activities of CAP at pointed ends and sides, firmly establish CAP as a key player in actin dynamics.\nFilter-aided expansion proteomics\nAuthors: Dong, Z.; Zhu, Y.; Zhang, F.; Wu, C.; Chen, T.; Chen, J.; Jiang, W.; Xiao, Q.; Zheng, S.; Piatkevich, K. D.; Guo, T.\nScore: 3.0, Published: 2023-12-02 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569242\nIntegration of hydrogel-based tissue expansion and mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables high spatial resolution analysis of global protein expression in tissues. Here, we introduce a filter-aided tissue expansion proteomics (FAXP) method with optimized hydrogel preparation and treatment steps for spatial proteomics analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Compared with our original ProteomEx method, FAXP, partially automated with robotics, exhibited 14.5-fold higher volumetric resolution, increased peptide yield leading to 250% more protein identifications, and 50% time consumption for sample preparation. We demonstrated its application in clinical colorectal tissue samples. We further integrated it with laser capture microdissection for proteomic analysis of subcellular organelles.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Cas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments. However, in vitro studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg2&#43; concentrations that would be present in cells. By profiling the specificity of Cas12a orthologs at a range of Mg2&#43; concentrations, we find that Cas12a switches its specificity depending on metal ion concentration. Lowering Mg2&#43; concentration decreases cleavage defects caused by seed mismatches, while increasing the defects caused by PAM-distal mismatches. We show that Cas12a can unwind and bind seed mutant targets more rapidly at low Mg2&#43; concentrations, resulting in faster cleavage. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches cause substantial defects in cleavage following formation of the Cas12a-target complex at low Mg2&#43; concentrations. We observe differences in Cas12a specificity switching between three orthologs that results in variations in the routes of phage escape from Cas12a-mediated immunity. Overall, our results reveal the importance of physiological metal ion conditions on the specificity of Cas effectors that are used in different cellular environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The inhibitors, CK-666 and CK-869, are widely used to probe the function of actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex in vitro and in cells. However, in mammals, the Arp2/3 complex consists of 8 iso-complexes, as three of its subunits (Arp3, ArpC1, ArpC5) are encoded by two different genes. Here, we used recombinant complexes with defined subunit composition to assess the activity of CK-666 and CK-869 against iso-complexes. We demonstrate that while both inhibitors prevent linear actin filament formation when either ArpC1A- or ArpC1B-containing complexes are activated by SPIN90, inhibition of actin branching depends on iso-complex composition. Both drugs inhibited actin branch formation by VCA-activated complexes containing ArpC1A, but only CK-869 can inhibit ArpC1B-containing complexes. Consistent with this, in bone marrow-derived macrophages which express very low levels of ArpC1A, CK-869 but not CK-666, impacted phagocytosis and migration. We also found that CK-869 is only able to inhibit Arp3-but not Arp3B-containing iso-complexes. Our analyses have important implications for the interpretation of results using CK-666 and CK-869, given that the relative expression levels of ArpC1 and Arp3 isoforms in cells and tissues remains largely unknown.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Metabolites play a central role in the chemical crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetic marks. Epigenetically relevant metabolites are substrates, products and cofactors that can act as activators or inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes, which control gene expression by adding or removing chemical marks in the DNA, RNA and histones. Diet composition, and biosynthetic pathways encoded in the gut microbiome and the host genome are the main sources of these metabolites for mammals. Despite the increasing interest in the study of the &#34;microbiota-nutrient metabolism-host epigenetic axis&#34; to understand health and disease, there is a lack of a sensitive and easy analytical method to detect epigenetically relevant metabolites simultaneously. Here, we show an straightforward biphasic extraction where the organic phase is directly analyzed by GC-EI MS to detect short-chain fatty acids and formate without chemical derivatization, and the aqueous phase is analyzed by HILIC coupled to ESI-MS/MS, which together can cover &gt;30 epigenetically relevant metabolites in biological samples such as liver, plasma or feces. In addition, we propose a stable isotope tracing method based on multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions by LC-QqQ MS to understand how 13C-labeled glucose or glutamine are used to build SAM and acetyl-CoA, the main methyl and acetyl group donors in epigenetic modifications, respectively. We anticipate that our methods will complement epigenomic and proteomic analyses adding another layer of molecular information towards mechanistic insights.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Microtubules are composed of /{beta}-tubulin dimers positioned head-to-tail to form protofilaments that associate laterally in varying numbers. It is not known how cellular microtubules assemble with the canonical 13-protofilament architecture, resulting in micrometer-scale /{beta}-tubulin tracks for intracellular transport that align with, rather than spiral along, the filaments long-axis. We report that the human [~]2.3MDa {gamma}-tubulin ring complex ({gamma}-TuRC), an essential regulator of microtubule formation that contains 14 {gamma}-tubulins, selectively nucleates 13-protofilament microtubules. Cryo-EM reconstructions of {gamma}-TuRC-capped microtubule minus-ends reveal the extensive intra- and inter-domain motions of {gamma}-TuRC subunits that accommodate its actin-containing luminal bridge and establish lateral and longitudinal interactions between {gamma}- and -tubulins. Our structures reveal how free {gamma}-TuRC, an inefficient nucleation template due to its splayed conformation, transforms into a stable cap that blocks addition or loss of /{beta}-tubulins from minus-ends and sets the lattice architecture of cellular microtubules.

        <p class="abstract">Surface lipids on pathogenic mycobacteria modulate infection outcomes by regulating host immune responses. Phenolic glycolipid (PGL) is a host-modulating surface lipid that varies among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. PGL is also found in Mycobacterium marinum where it promotes infection of zebrafish through effects on the innate immune system. Given the important role this lipid plays in the host-pathogen relationship, tools for profiling its abundance, spatial distribution, and dynamics are needed. Here we report a strategy for imaging PGL in live mycobacteria using bioorthogonal metabolic labeling. We functionalized the PGL precursor p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHB) with an azide group (3-azido pHB). When fed to mycobacteria, 3-azido pHB was incorporated into the cell surface, which could then be visualized via bioorthogonal conjugation of a fluorescent probe. We confirmed that 3-azido pHB incorporates into PGL using mass spectrometry methods and demonstrated selectivity for PGL-producing Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Finally, we applied this metabolic labeling strategy to study the dynamics of PGL within the mycobacterial membrane. This new tool enables visualization of PGL which may facilitate studies of mycobacterial pathogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The flavivirus NS3 helicase (NS3h), a highly conserved protein, plays a pivotal role in virus replication and thus represents a potential drug target for flavivirus pathogenesis. NS3h utilizes nucleotide triphosphate, such as ATP, for hydrolysis energy (ATPase) to translocate on single-stranded nucleic acids, which is an important step in the unwinding of double-stranded nucleic acids. The intermediate states along the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle, as well as the conformational changes between these states, represent important yet difficult-to-identify targets for potential inhibitors. We use extensive molecular dynamics simulations of apo, ATP, ADP&#43;Pi, and ADP bound to WNV NS3h&#43;ssRNA to model the conformational ensembles along this cycle. Energetic and structural clustering analyses on these trajectories depict a clear trend of differential enthalpic affinity of NS3h with ADP, demonstrating a probable mechanism of hydrolysis turnover regulated by the motif-VI loop (MVIL). These findings were experimentally corroborated using viral replicons encoding three mutations at the D471 position. Replication assays using these mutants demonstrated a substantial reduction in viral replication compared to the wild-type. Molecular simulations of the D471 mutants in the apo state indicate a shift in MVIL populations favoring either a closed or open  valve conformation, affecting ATP entry or stabilization, respectively. Combining our molecular modeling with experimental evidence highlights a conformation-dependent role for MVIL as a  valve for the ATP-pocket, presenting a promising target for antiviral development.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a human pathogen that is now endemic to several East Asian countries. The viral large (L) protein catalyzes viral transcription by stealing host mRNA caps via a process known as cap-snatching. Here, we establish an in vitro cap-snatching assay and present three high-quality electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the SFTSV L protein in biologically relevant, transcription-specific states. In a priming-state structure, we show capped RNA bound to the L protein cap-binding domain (CBD). The L protein conformation in this priming structure is significantly different from published replication-state structures, in particular the N- and C-terminal domains. The capped-RNA is positioned in a way that it can feed directly into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) ready for elongation. We also captured the L protein in an early-elongation state following primer-incorporation demonstrating that this priming conformation is retained at least in the very early stages of primer extension. This structural data is complemented by in vitro biochemical and cell-based assays. Together, these insights further our mechanistic understanding of how SFTSV and other bunyaviruses incorporate stolen host mRNA fragments into their viral transcripts thereby allowing the virus to hijack host cell translation machinery.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Xanthomonas species contain numerous notoriously well-known plant pathogens. Among various pathogenic factors, the role of -1,6-cyclized {beta}-1,2-glucohexadecaose (C{beta}G16) produced by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris was shown previously to be vital for infecting model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. However, enzymes responsible for biosynthesising C{beta}G16 are essentially unknown, which limits the generation of agrichemicals that inhibit C{beta}G16 synthesis. In this study, we discovered that OpgD from X. campestris pv. campestris converts linear {beta}-1,2-glucan to C{beta}G16. Structural and functional analyses revealed that OpgD from X. campestris pv. campestris possesses an anomer-inverting transglycosylation mechanism, which is unprecedented among carbohydrate-active enzymes. The discovery of this unprecedented glucan-generating mechanism reveals a new foundation for the enzymatic synthesis of carbohydrates. Furthermore, identifying C{beta}G16 synthase highly conserved in Xanthomonas provides a broadly adaptable drug target for new-genre agrichemicals that overcome antimicrobial-resistant bacterial issues.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cellular actin networks display distinct assembly and disassembly dynamics resulting from multicomponent reactions occurring primarily at the two ends and the sides of actin filaments. While barbed ends are considered the hotspot of actin assembly, disassembly is thought to primarily occur via reactions on filament sides and pointed ends. Cyclase-associated protein (CAP) has emerged as the main protagonist of actin disassembly and remodeling. CAP collaborates with cofilin to increase pointed-end depolymerization by 300 fold, promotes filament coalescence in presence of Abp1, and accelerates nucleotide exchange to regenerate monomers for new rounds of assembly. CAP has also been reported to enhance cofilin-mediated severing, but these claims have since been challenged. Using microfluidics-assisted three-color single-molecule imaging, we now reveal that CAP also has important functions at filament barbed ends. We reveal that CAP is a processive barbed-end depolymerase capable of tracking both ends of the filament. Each CAP binding event leads to removal of about 5,175 and 620 subunits from the barbed and pointed ends respectively. We find that the WH2 domain is essential, and the CARP domain is dispensable for barbed-end depolymerization. We show that CAP co-localizes with barbed-end bound formin and capping protein, in the process increasing residence time of formin by 10-fold and promoting dissociation of CP by 4-fold. Our barbed-end observations combined with previously reported activities of CAP at pointed ends and sides, firmly establish CAP as a key player in actin dynamics.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Integration of hydrogel-based tissue expansion and mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables high spatial resolution analysis of global protein expression in tissues. Here, we introduce a filter-aided tissue expansion proteomics (FAXP) method with optimized hydrogel preparation and treatment steps for spatial proteomics analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Compared with our original ProteomEx method, FAXP, partially automated with robotics, exhibited 14.5-fold higher volumetric resolution, increased peptide yield leading to 250% more protein identifications, and 50% time consumption for sample preparation. We demonstrated its application in clinical colorectal tissue samples. We further integrated it with laser capture microdissection for proteomic analysis of subcellular organelles.</p>
