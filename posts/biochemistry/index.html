R.\nScore: 34.5, Published: 2023-12-06 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.06.570444\nImmune cells in the tumor microenvironment are not only powerful regulators of immunosuppression and tumorigenesis, but also represent a dominant cell type, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprising up to 50% of total cell mass in solid tumors. Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) derive their efficacy from this cancer-immune cell interface, however, immune-related adverse events resulting from systemic blockade remain a significant challenge. To address this need for potent, yet highly tumor-specific immunotherapies, we developed Tumor-Immune Cell Targeting Chimeras (TICTACs), antibody conjugates that are capable of selectively depleting immune checkpoint receptors such as SIRP from the surface of TAMs. These chimeric molecules consist of a synthetic glycan ligand that binds the C-type lectin CD206, a well-established TAM marker, conjugated to a non-blocking antibody that binds but does not inhibit the checkpoint receptor. By engaging CD206, which constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes, TICTACs facilitate robust removal of the checkpoint receptors from the surface of CD206high macrophages, while having no effect on CD206low macrophages. By decoupling antibody selectivity from its blocking function, we present a new paradigm for developing highly tumor-specific immunotherapies.\nTwo distinct ferredoxins are essential for nitrogen fixation by the iron nitrogenase in Rhodobacter capsulatus\nAuthors: Addison, H. G.; Glatter, T. G.; Hochberg, G. K. A.; Rebelein, J. G.\nScore: 14.9, Published: 2023-12-07 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570605\nNitrogenases are the only enzymes able to fix gaseous nitrogen into bioavailable ammonia and, hence, are essential for sustaining life. Catalysis by nitrogenases requires both a large amount of ATP and electrons donated by strongly reducing ferredoxins or flavodoxins. Our knowledge about the mechanisms of electron transfer to nitrogenase enzymes is limited: The electron transport to the iron (Fe)-nitrogenase has hardly been investigated. Here, we characterised the electron transfer pathway to the Fe-nitrogenase in Rhodobacter capsulatus via proteome analyses, genetic deletions, complementation studies and phylogenetics. Proteome analyses revealed an upregulation of four ferredoxins under nitrogen-fixing conditions reliant on the Fe-nitrogenase in a molybdenum nitrogenase knockout strain, compared to non-nitrogen-fixing conditions. Based on these findings, R. capsulatus strains with deletions of ferredoxin (fdx) and flavodoxin (fld, nifF) genes were constructed to investigate their roles in nitrogen fixation by the Fe-nitrogenase. R. capsulatus deletion strains were characterised by monitoring diazotrophic growth and Fe-nitrogenase activity in vivo. Only deletions of fdxC or fdxN resulted in slower growth and reduced Fe-nitrogenase activity, whereas the double-deletion of both fdxC and fdxN abolished diazotrophic growth. Differences in the proteomes of {Delta}fdxC and {Delta}fdxN strains, in conjunction with differing plasmid complementation behaviours of fdxC and fdxN, indicate that the two Fds likely possess different roles and functions. These findings will guide future engineering of the electron transport systems to nitrogenase enzymes, with the aim of increased electron flux and product formation. ImportanceNitrogenases are essential for biological nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen gas to bioavailable ammonia. Production of ammonia by diazotrophic organisms, harbouring nitrogenases, is essential for sustaining plant growth. Hence, there is a large scientific interest in understanding the cellular mechanisms for nitrogen fixation via nitrogenases. Nitrogenases rely on highly reduced electrons to power catalysis, though we lack knowledge as to which proteins shuttle the electrons to nitrogenases within cells. Here, we characterised the electron transport to the iron (Fe)-nitrogenase in the model diazotroph Rhodobacter capsulatus, showing that two distinct ferredoxins are very important for nitrogen fixation despite having different redox centres. Additionally, our research expands upon the debate on whether ferredoxins have functional redundancy or perform distinct roles within cells. Here, we observe that both essential ferredoxins likely have distinct roles based on differential proteome shifts of deletion strains and different complementation behaviours.\nIGF2BP1 phosphorylation regulates ribonucleoprotein condensate formation by impairing low-affinity protein and RNA interactions\nAuthors: Hornegger, H.; Muratovic, A.; Anisimova, A. S.; Burgeois, B. R.; Spinetti, E.; Covino, R.; Madl, T.; Karagoz, G. E.\nScore: 12.4, Published: 2023-12-05 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.05.570121\nThe insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein (IGF2BP1) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA stability, localization, and translation. IGF2BP1 is part of various ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates regulating RNA outputs. However, the mechanism that regulates its assembly into condensates remains unknown. Here we found, using proteomics, that IGF2BP1 phosphorylation at S181 in a disordered linker is regulated in a stress-dependent manner. Phosphomimetic mutations in two disordered linkers, S181E and Y396E, modulated RNP condensate formation by IGF2BP1 without impacting its binding affinity for RNA. Intriguingly, the S181E mutant, which lies in linker 1, impaired IGF2BP1 condensate formation in vitro and in cells, whereas a Y396E mutant in the second linker increased condensate size and dynamics. Structural approaches showed that the first linker binds RNAs nonspecifically through its RGG/RG motif, an interaction weakened in the S181E mutant. Notably, linker 2 interacts with IGF2BP1s folded domains and these interactions were partially impaired in the Y396E mutant. Our data reveal how phosphorylation modulates low affinity interaction networks in disordered linkers to regulate RNP condensate formation.\nUncoupled substrate binding underlies the evolutionary switch between Na+ and H+-coupled prokaryotic aspartate transporters\nAuthors: Reddy, K. D.; Rasool, B.; Akher, F. B.; Kutlesic, N.; Pant, S.; Boudker, O.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569786\nSecondary active membrane transporters use the electrochemical energy of ion gradients to concentrate their substrates. Transporters within the same family often evolve to use different ions, driven by physiological needs or bioavailability. How such functional differences arise despite similar threedimensional protein structures is mostly unknown. We used phylogenetics and ancestral sequence reconstruction on prokaryotic glutamate transporters to recapitulate the evolutionary transition from Na+-coupled (GT-Na) to H+-coupled (GT-H) transport and discovered that it occurred via an intermediate clade (GT-Int). The reconstructed ancestral transporter AncGT-Int contains all residues required for Na+ binding but switched from Na+-coupled substrate binding, characteristic of GT-Na transporters, to uncoupled binding. The high-resolution cryo-EM structures of AncGT-Int show that it binds substrate without Na+ ions in the same manner as GT-Na transporters, which instead require Na+ ions. Unlike GT-Na transporters, remodeled by ions into a high-affinity substrate-binding configuration, apo AncGT-Int is already in this configuration. Our results show how allosteric changes eliminated Na+ dependence of Na+-coupled transporters before H+ dependence arose, shedding light on ion coupling mechanisms and evolution in this family, and highlighting the power of phylogenetics and ancestral sequence reconstruction in the structure-function studies of membrane transporters.\nMechanism of connexin channel inhibition by mefloquine and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate\nAuthors: Lavriha, P.; Han, Y.; Ding, X.; Qi, C.; Vaithia, A.; Korkhov, V. M.\nScore: 10.2, Published: 2023-12-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.11.571071\nGap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between two adjacent cells involves direct exchange of cytosolic ions and small molecules via connexin gap junction channels (GJCs). Connexin GJCs have emerged as drug targets, with small molecule connexin inhibitors considered a viable therapeutic strategy in a number of diseases. The molecular mechanisms of GJC inhibition by known small molecule connexin inhibitors remain unknown, preventing the development of more potent and connexin-specific therapeutics. Here we show that two GJC inhibitors, mefloquine (MFQ) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) bind to Cx32 and block dye permeation across Cx32 hemichannels (HCs) and GJCs. Cryo-EM analysis shows that 2APB binds to site A, close to the N-terminal gating helix of Cx32 GJC, restricting the entrance to the channel pore. In contrast, MFQ binds to a distinct site M, deeply buried within the pore. MFQ binding to this site modifies the electrostatic properties of Cx32 pore. Mutagenesis of V37, a key residue located in the site M, renders Cx32 HCs and GJCs insensitive to MFQ-mediated inhibition. Moreover, our cryo-EM analysis, mutagenesis and activity assays show that MFQ targets the M site in Cx43 GJC similarly to Cx32. Taken together, our results point to a conserved inhibitor binding site in connexin channels, opening a new route for development of specific drugs targeting connexins.\nSubstrate recognition and selectivity in SARS-CoV-2 main protease: Unveiling the role of subsite interactions through dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations\nAuthors: Chan, H. T. H.; Oliveira, A. S. F.; Mulholland, A. J.; Schofield, C. J.; Duarte, F.\nScore: 5.7, Published: 2023-12-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.01.569046\nThe main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus employs a cysteine-histidine dyad in its active site to catalyse hydrolysis of the viral polyproteins. It is well established that binding of the substrate P1-Gln in the S1 subsite of Mpro active site is crucial for catalysis and this interaction has been employed to inform inhibitor design; however, how Mpro dynamically recognises and responds to substrate binding remains difficult to probe by experimental methods. We thus employed the dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) approach to probe the response of Mpro to systematic substrate variations. The results emphasise the importance of P1-Gln for initiating a productive enzymatic reaction. Specifically, substituting P1-Gln with alanine disrupts the conformations of the Cys145 and His41 dyad, causing Cys145 to transition from the productive gauche conformation to the non-productive trans conformation. Importantly, our findings indicate that Mpro exhibits dynamic responses to substrate binding and likely to substrate-mimicking inhibitors within each of the S4-S2' subsites. The results inform on the substrate selectivity requirements and shed light on the observed variations in hydrolytic efficiencies of Mpro towards different substrates. Some interactions between substrate residues and enzyme subsites involve more induced fit than others, implying that differences in functional group flexibility may optimise the binding of a substrate or inhibitor in a particular subsite.\nConserved N-terminal Regulation of the ACA8 Calcium Pump with Two Calmodulin Binding Sites\nAuthors: Larsen, S. T.; Dannersoe, J. K.; Nielsen, C. J. F.; Poulsen, L. R.; Palmgren, M.; Nissen, P.\nScore: 4.5, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.07.570580\nThe autoinhibited plasma membrane calcium ATPase, ACA8 from A. thaliana has an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Calcium-bound calmodulin binding at two sites located at residues 42-62 and 74-96 relieves autoinhibition of ACA8 activity. We investigated N-terminally truncated ACA8 constructs (WT, {Delta}20, {Delta}30, {Delta}35, {Delta}37, {Delta}40, {Delta}74 and {Delta}100) to explore the role of conserved motifs in the N-terminal segment preceding the calmodulin binding sites. Furthermore, we purified WT, {Delta}20- and {Delta}100-ACA8, tested activity in vitro and performed structural studies of purified {Delta}20-ACA8 stabilized in its native form to explore the mechanism of autoinhibition. Through activity studies and a yeast complementation assay, we show that an N-terminal segment between residues 20 and 35, upstream of the calmodulin binding sites, is important for autoinhibition and the activation by calmodulin, and that a conserved Phe32 is essential for autoinhibition. Cryo-EM structure determination at 3.3 [A] resolution of a beryllium fluoride inhibited form shows no autoinhibition, but a low-resolution structure for an E1 state indicates autoinhibitory domain binding consistent with the mutational studies and AlphaFold predicted structures.\nStructural basis for inhibition of βFXIIa by garadacimab\nAuthors: Drulyte, I.; Ghai, R.; Ow, S. Y.; Kapp, E.; Quek, A.; Panousis, C.; Wilson, M. J.; Nash, A. D.; Pelzing, M.\nScore: 11.7, Published: 2023-12-04 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.03.569829\nFXIIa is the principal initiator of the plasma contact system and can activate both procoagulant and proinflammatory pathways. Its activity is important in the pathophysiology of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). Here, we describe a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the beta-chain from FXIIa ({beta}FXIIa) complexed with the Fab fragment of garadacimab. Garadacimab binds to {beta}FXIIa through an unusually long CDR-H3 that inserts into the S1 pocket in a non-canonical way. This atypical structural mechanism is likely the primary contributor in the inhibition of activated FXII proteolytic activity in HAE. Garadacimab Fab-{beta}FXIIa structure also reveals critical determinants of high-affinity binding of garadacimab to activated FXII. Structural analysis with other bonafide FXIIa inhibitors, such as benzamidine and C1-INH, reveals a conserved mechanism of {beta}FXIIa inhibition, a novel finding of this study. In summary, garadacimab Fab-{beta}FXIIa structure provides crucial insights into its mechanism of action and delineates primary and auxiliary paratopes/epitopes. This work reaffirms the benefits of cryo-EM as a primary tool to study antigen-antibody complexes in near native state, particularly where other methods have fallen short.\nCRISPR-Cas12a exhibits metal-dependent specificity switching\nAuthors: Nguyen, G. T.; Schelling, M. A.; Buscher, K. A.; Sritharan, A.; Sashital, D. G.\nScore: 43.9, Published: 2023-11-29 DOI: 10.1101/2023.11.29.569287\nCas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments. However, in vitro studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg2+ concentrations that would be present in cells. By profiling the specificity of Cas12a orthologs at a range of Mg2+ concentrations, we find that Cas12a switches its specificity depending on metal ion concentration. Lowering Mg2+ concentration decreases cleavage defects caused by seed mismatches, while increasing the defects caused by PAM-distal mismatches. We show that Cas12a can unwind and bind seed mutant targets more rapidly at low Mg2+ concentrations, resulting in faster cleavage. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches cause substantial defects in cleavage following formation of the Cas12a-target complex at low Mg2+ concentrations. We observe differences in Cas12a specificity switching between three orthologs that results in variations in the routes of phage escape from Cas12a-mediated immunity. Overall, our results reveal the importance of physiological metal ion conditions on the specificity of Cas effectors that are used in different cellular environments.\nOvothiol is a redundant part of a complex thiol network in promastigote Leishmania mexicana\nAuthors: Bolton, V. L.; Morrison, L. L.; Khanra, S.; Ritchie, R.; Hargrave, K. E.; Burchmore, R. J. S.; MacLeod, M. K. L.; Barrett, M. P.\nScore: 2.8, Published: 2023-12-08 DOI: 10.1101/2023.12.08.570742\nA gene encoding OvoA, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of ovothiol, was excised form the genome of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes using CRISPR/cas mediated gene editing. The role of the enzyme in synthesising ovothiol was confirmed since both ovothiol A and ovothiol B were lost from the metabolome of the modified cells. The OvoA knockout line had similar growth kinetics to wild-type progenitor cells and, moreover, most of the changes in metabolism that accompanied the transition of log stage growth to stationary phase were mirrored in the KO line. Significant differences, however, were observed in the ratio of the reduced and oxidised forms of the other major low molecular weight thiols, glutathione and trypanothione, indicative of a role of these other thiols in maintaining reduced ovothiol and demonstrating an interconnected network of low molecular weight thiols in these cells. The OvoA knockout cells remained infective to macrophages where promastigotes transformed to amastigote forms in a manner similar to wild-type. The knockout line was tested for sensitivity to a range of current anti-leishmanial drugs and oxidative and nitrosative stresses. While generally the absence of ovothiol caused little or no change in sensitivity to these stress-inducing agents, enhanced sensitivity to amphotericin B was noted. Author summaryOvothiol is a low molecular weight histidine-derived thiol first described in sea urchin eggs, and later found in many organisms, including the protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida, that includes human pathogens such as the Leishmania species that cause leishmaniasis. Thiol metabolism in the Kinetoplastidae has been studied in some detail, particularly with regard to an unusual bis-glutathione, spermidine conjugate named trypanothione that takes on many of the roles performed by glutathione in most other organisms. Roles for ovothiol in Leishmania have not been previously defined, although potential roles in defence against oxidative stress have been hypothesised. A gene encoding the first enzyme of the pathway involved in ovothiol production, OvoA, was excised from the Leishmania mexicana genome. Its role in ovothiol synthesis was confirmed as ovothiol was absent from the mutants. Little changed, however, with respect to the phenotype of these cells, including their proliferation rate, their ability to infect macrophages or their sensitivity to a range of stress inducing agents. These included several leishmanicidal drugs, oxidative and nitrosative stresses. For amphotericin B, however, the Ovothiol lacking cells were more sensitive than wild-type indicating some role in defence against the impact of this drug.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are not only powerful regulators of immunosuppression and tumorigenesis, but also represent a dominant cell type, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprising up to 50% of total cell mass in solid tumors. Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) derive their efficacy from this cancer-immune cell interface, however, immune-related adverse events resulting from systemic blockade remain a significant challenge. To address this need for potent, yet highly tumor-specific immunotherapies, we developed Tumor-Immune Cell Targeting Chimeras (TICTACs), antibody conjugates that are capable of selectively depleting immune checkpoint receptors such as SIRP from the surface of TAMs. These chimeric molecules consist of a synthetic glycan ligand that binds the C-type lectin CD206, a well-established TAM marker, conjugated to a non-blocking antibody that binds but does not inhibit the checkpoint receptor. By engaging CD206, which constitutively recycles between the plasma membrane and early endosomes, TICTACs facilitate robust removal of the checkpoint receptors from the surface of CD206high macrophages, while having no effect on CD206low macrophages. By decoupling antibody selectivity from its blocking function, we present a new paradigm for developing highly tumor-specific immunotherapies.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Nitrogenases are the only enzymes able to fix gaseous nitrogen into bioavailable ammonia and, hence, are essential for sustaining life. Catalysis by nitrogenases requires both a large amount of ATP and electrons donated by strongly reducing ferredoxins or flavodoxins. Our knowledge about the mechanisms of electron transfer to nitrogenase enzymes is limited: The electron transport to the iron (Fe)-nitrogenase has hardly been investigated. Here, we characterised the electron transfer pathway to the Fe-nitrogenase in Rhodobacter capsulatus via proteome analyses, genetic deletions, complementation studies and phylogenetics. Proteome analyses revealed an upregulation of four ferredoxins under nitrogen-fixing conditions reliant on the Fe-nitrogenase in a molybdenum nitrogenase knockout strain, compared to non-nitrogen-fixing conditions. Based on these findings, R. capsulatus strains with deletions of ferredoxin (fdx) and flavodoxin (fld, nifF) genes were constructed to investigate their roles in nitrogen fixation by the Fe-nitrogenase. R. capsulatus deletion strains were characterised by monitoring diazotrophic growth and Fe-nitrogenase activity in vivo. Only deletions of fdxC or fdxN resulted in slower growth and reduced Fe-nitrogenase activity, whereas the double-deletion of both fdxC and fdxN abolished diazotrophic growth. Differences in the proteomes of {Delta}fdxC and {Delta}fdxN strains, in conjunction with differing plasmid complementation behaviours of fdxC and fdxN, indicate that the two Fds likely possess different roles and functions. These findings will guide future engineering of the electron transport systems to nitrogenase enzymes, with the aim of increased electron flux and product formation.

ImportanceNitrogenases are essential for biological nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen gas to bioavailable ammonia. Production of ammonia by diazotrophic organisms, harbouring nitrogenases, is essential for sustaining plant growth. Hence, there is a large scientific interest in understanding the cellular mechanisms for nitrogen fixation via nitrogenases. Nitrogenases rely on highly reduced electrons to power catalysis, though we lack knowledge as to which proteins shuttle the electrons to nitrogenases within cells. Here, we characterised the electron transport to the iron (Fe)-nitrogenase in the model diazotroph Rhodobacter capsulatus, showing that two distinct ferredoxins are very important for nitrogen fixation despite having different redox centres. Additionally, our research expands upon the debate on whether ferredoxins have functional redundancy or perform distinct roles within cells. Here, we observe that both essential ferredoxins likely have distinct roles based on differential proteome shifts of deletion strains and different complementation behaviours.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein (IGF2BP1) is a conserved RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA stability, localization, and translation. IGF2BP1 is part of various ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates regulating RNA outputs. However, the mechanism that regulates its assembly into condensates remains unknown. Here we found, using proteomics, that IGF2BP1 phosphorylation at S181 in a disordered linker is regulated in a stress-dependent manner. Phosphomimetic mutations in two disordered linkers, S181E and Y396E, modulated RNP condensate formation by IGF2BP1 without impacting its binding affinity for RNA. Intriguingly, the S181E mutant, which lies in linker 1, impaired IGF2BP1 condensate formation in vitro and in cells, whereas a Y396E mutant in the second linker increased condensate size and dynamics. Structural approaches showed that the first linker binds RNAs nonspecifically through its RGG/RG motif, an interaction weakened in the S181E mutant. Notably, linker 2 interacts with IGF2BP1s folded domains and these interactions were partially impaired in the Y396E mutant. Our data reveal how phosphorylation modulates low affinity interaction networks in disordered linkers to regulate RNP condensate formation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Secondary active membrane transporters use the electrochemical energy of ion gradients to concentrate their substrates. Transporters within the same family often evolve to use different ions, driven by physiological needs or bioavailability. How such functional differences arise despite similar threedimensional protein structures is mostly unknown. We used phylogenetics and ancestral sequence reconstruction on prokaryotic glutamate transporters to recapitulate the evolutionary transition from Na&#43;-coupled (GT-Na) to H&#43;-coupled (GT-H) transport and discovered that it occurred via an intermediate clade (GT-Int). The reconstructed ancestral transporter AncGT-Int contains all residues required for Na&#43; binding but switched from Na&#43;-coupled substrate binding, characteristic of GT-Na transporters, to uncoupled binding. The high-resolution cryo-EM structures of AncGT-Int show that it binds substrate without Na&#43; ions in the same manner as GT-Na transporters, which instead require Na&#43; ions. Unlike GT-Na transporters, remodeled by ions into a high-affinity substrate-binding configuration, apo AncGT-Int is already in this configuration. Our results show how allosteric changes eliminated Na&#43; dependence of Na&#43;-coupled transporters before H&#43; dependence arose, shedding light on ion coupling mechanisms and evolution in this family, and highlighting the power of phylogenetics and ancestral sequence reconstruction in the structure-function studies of membrane transporters.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between two adjacent cells involves direct exchange of cytosolic ions and small molecules via connexin gap junction channels (GJCs). Connexin GJCs have emerged as drug targets, with small molecule connexin inhibitors considered a viable therapeutic strategy in a number of diseases. The molecular mechanisms of GJC inhibition by known small molecule connexin inhibitors remain unknown, preventing the development of more potent and connexin-specific therapeutics. Here we show that two GJC inhibitors, mefloquine (MFQ) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) bind to Cx32 and block dye permeation across Cx32 hemichannels (HCs) and GJCs. Cryo-EM analysis shows that 2APB binds to site A, close to the N-terminal gating helix of Cx32 GJC, restricting the entrance to the channel pore. In contrast, MFQ binds to a distinct site M, deeply buried within the pore. MFQ binding to this site modifies the electrostatic properties of Cx32 pore. Mutagenesis of V37, a key residue located in the site M, renders Cx32 HCs and GJCs insensitive to MFQ-mediated inhibition. Moreover, our cryo-EM analysis, mutagenesis and activity assays show that MFQ targets the M site in Cx43 GJC similarly to Cx32. Taken together, our results point to a conserved inhibitor binding site in connexin channels, opening a new route for development of specific drugs targeting connexins.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus employs a cysteine-histidine dyad in its active site to catalyse hydrolysis of the viral polyproteins. It is well established that binding of the substrate P1-Gln in the S1 subsite of Mpro active site is crucial for catalysis and this interaction has been employed to inform inhibitor design; however, how Mpro dynamically recognises and responds to substrate binding remains difficult to probe by experimental methods. We thus employed the dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) approach to probe the response of Mpro to systematic substrate variations. The results emphasise the importance of P1-Gln for initiating a productive enzymatic reaction. Specifically, substituting P1-Gln with alanine disrupts the conformations of the Cys145 and His41 dyad, causing Cys145 to transition from the productive gauche conformation to the non-productive trans conformation. Importantly, our findings indicate that Mpro exhibits dynamic responses to substrate binding and likely to substrate-mimicking inhibitors within each of the S4-S2&#39; subsites. The results inform on the substrate selectivity requirements and shed light on the observed variations in hydrolytic efficiencies of Mpro towards different substrates. Some interactions between substrate residues and enzyme subsites involve more induced fit than others, implying that differences in functional group flexibility may optimise the binding of a substrate or inhibitor in a particular subsite.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The autoinhibited plasma membrane calcium ATPase, ACA8 from A. thaliana has an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. Calcium-bound calmodulin binding at two sites located at residues 42-62 and 74-96 relieves autoinhibition of ACA8 activity.

We investigated N-terminally truncated ACA8 constructs (WT, {Delta}20, {Delta}30, {Delta}35, {Delta}37, {Delta}40, {Delta}74 and {Delta}100) to explore the role of conserved motifs in the N-terminal segment preceding the calmodulin binding sites. Furthermore, we purified WT, {Delta}20- and {Delta}100-ACA8, tested activity in vitro and performed structural studies of purified {Delta}20-ACA8 stabilized in its native form to explore the mechanism of autoinhibition.

Through activity studies and a yeast complementation assay, we show that an N-terminal segment between residues 20 and 35, upstream of the calmodulin binding sites, is important for autoinhibition and the activation by calmodulin, and that a conserved Phe32 is essential for autoinhibition. Cryo-EM structure determination at 3.3 [A] resolution of a beryllium fluoride inhibited form shows no autoinhibition, but a low-resolution structure for an E1 state indicates autoinhibitory domain binding consistent with the mutational studies and AlphaFold predicted structures.</p>

Garadacimab binds to {beta}FXIIa through an unusually long CDR-H3 that inserts into the S1 pocket in a non-canonical way. This atypical structural mechanism is likely the primary contributor in the inhibition of activated FXII proteolytic activity in HAE. Garadacimab Fab-{beta}FXIIa structure also reveals critical determinants of high-affinity binding of garadacimab to activated FXII. Structural analysis with other bonafide FXIIa inhibitors, such as benzamidine and C1-INH, reveals a conserved mechanism of {beta}FXIIa inhibition, a novel finding of this study. In summary, garadacimab Fab-{beta}FXIIa structure provides crucial insights into its mechanism of action and delineates primary and auxiliary paratopes/epitopes. This work reaffirms the benefits of cryo-EM as a primary tool to study antigen-antibody complexes in near native state, particularly where other methods have fallen short.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cas12a is the immune effector of type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems and has been co-opted for genome editing and other biotechnology tools. The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both in vitro and in genome editing experiments. However, in vitro studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg2&#43; concentrations that would be present in cells. By profiling the specificity of Cas12a orthologs at a range of Mg2&#43; concentrations, we find that Cas12a switches its specificity depending on metal ion concentration. Lowering Mg2&#43; concentration decreases cleavage defects caused by seed mismatches, while increasing the defects caused by PAM-distal mismatches. We show that Cas12a can unwind and bind seed mutant targets more rapidly at low Mg2&#43; concentrations, resulting in faster cleavage. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches cause substantial defects in cleavage following formation of the Cas12a-target complex at low Mg2&#43; concentrations. We observe differences in Cas12a specificity switching between three orthologs that results in variations in the routes of phage escape from Cas12a-mediated immunity. Overall, our results reveal the importance of physiological metal ion conditions on the specificity of Cas effectors that are used in different cellular environments.</p>

        <p class="abstract">A gene encoding OvoA, a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of ovothiol, was excised form the genome of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes using CRISPR/cas mediated gene editing. The role of the enzyme in synthesising ovothiol was confirmed since both ovothiol A and ovothiol B were lost from the metabolome of the modified cells. The OvoA knockout line had similar growth kinetics to wild-type progenitor cells and, moreover, most of the changes in metabolism that accompanied the transition of log stage growth to stationary phase were mirrored in the KO line. Significant differences, however, were observed in the ratio of the reduced and oxidised forms of the other major low molecular weight thiols, glutathione and trypanothione, indicative of a role of these other thiols in maintaining reduced ovothiol and demonstrating an interconnected network of low molecular weight thiols in these cells. The OvoA knockout cells remained infective to macrophages where promastigotes transformed to amastigote forms in a manner similar to wild-type. The knockout line was tested for sensitivity to a range of current anti-leishmanial drugs and oxidative and nitrosative stresses. While generally the absence of ovothiol caused little or no change in sensitivity to these stress-inducing agents, enhanced sensitivity to amphotericin B was noted.

Author summaryOvothiol is a low molecular weight histidine-derived thiol first described in sea urchin eggs, and later found in many organisms, including the protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida, that includes human pathogens such as the Leishmania species that cause leishmaniasis. Thiol metabolism in the Kinetoplastidae has been studied in some detail, particularly with regard to an unusual bis-glutathione, spermidine conjugate named trypanothione that takes on many of the roles performed by glutathione in most other organisms. Roles for ovothiol in Leishmania have not been previously defined, although potential roles in defence against oxidative stress have been hypothesised. A gene encoding the first enzyme of the pathway involved in ovothiol production, OvoA, was excised from the Leishmania mexicana genome. Its role in ovothiol synthesis was confirmed as ovothiol was absent from the mutants. Little changed, however, with respect to the phenotype of these cells, including their proliferation rate, their ability to infect macrophages or their sensitivity to a range of stress inducing agents. These included several leishmanicidal drugs, oxidative and nitrosative stresses. For amphotericin B, however, the Ovothiol lacking cells were more sensitive than wild-type indicating some role in defence against the impact of this drug.</p>
