K.; Eriksson, L.; Grabarics, M.; Fremdling, P.; Konijnenberg, A.; Makarov, A. A.; Botman, A.; Peter, C.; Benesch, J. L. P.; Robinson, C. V.; Gault, J.; Baker, L.; Bharat, T. A. M.; Rauschenbach, S.\nScore: 47.8, Published: 2023-08-17 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.17.553673\nNative mass spectrometry (native MS) is a powerful technique that provides information on stoichiometry, interactions, homogeneity and shape of protein complexes. However, the extent of deviation between protein structures in the mass spectrometer and in solution remains a matter of debate. Here, we uncover the gas-phase structure of {beta}-galactosidase using single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) down to 2.6 A resolution, enabled by soft-landing of mass-selected protein complexes onto cold TEM grids and in-situ ice coating. We find that large parts of the secondary and tertiary structure are retained from solution, with dehydration-driven subunit reorientation leading to consistent compaction in the gas phase. Our work enables visualizing the structure of gas-phase protein complexes from numerous experimental scenarios at side-chain resolution and demonstrates the possibility of more controlled cryo-EM sample preparation.\nDNA end sensing and cleavage by the Shedu anti-phage defense system\nAuthors: Loeff, L.; Walter, A.; Rosalen, G. T.; Jinek, M.\nScore: 40.7, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552762\nThe detection of molecular patterns associated with invading pathogens is a hallmark of innate immune systems. Prokaryotes deploy sophisticated host-defense mechanisms in innate anti-phage immunity. Shedu is a single-component defense system comprising a putative nuclease SduA. Here we report cryo-EM structures of apo- and dsDNA-bound tetrameric SduA assemblies, revealing that the N-terminal domains of SduA form a clamp that recognizes free DNA ends. End binding positions the DNA over the PD/ExK nuclease domain, resulting in dsDNA nicking at a fixed distance from the 5 end. The end-directed DNA nicking activity of Shedu prevents propagation of linear DNA in vivo. Finally, we show that phages escape Shedu immunity by suppressing their recombination-dependent DNA replication pathway. Taken together, these results define the antiviral mechanism of Shedu systems, underlining the paradigm that recognition of pathogen-specific nucleic acid structures is a conserved feature of innate immunity across all domains of life.\nStructure and activation mechanism of the Makes caterpillars floppy 1 toxin\nAuthors: Belyy, A.; Heilen, P.; Hagel, P.; Hofnagel, O.; Raunser, S.\nScore: 18.9, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.553178\nThe bacterial Makes caterpillars floppy 1 (Mcf1) toxin promotes apoptosis in insects, leading to loss of body turgor and death. The molecular mechanism underlying Mcf1 intoxication is poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of Mcf1 from Photorhabdus luminescens, revealing a seahorse-like shape with a head and tail. While the three head domains contain two effectors, an activator-binding domain (ABD) and an autoprotease, the tail consists of two translocation as well as three receptor-binding domains. Rearrangement of the tail moves the C-terminus away from the ABD and allows binding of the host cell ADP-ribosylation factor 3, inducing conformational changes that position the cleavage site closer to the protease. This unique activation mechanism that is based on a hook-loop interaction results in three autocleavage reactions and the release of two toxic effectors. Unexpectedly, the BH3-like domain containing ABD is not an active effector. Our findings allow us to understand key steps of Mcf1 intoxication at the molecular level.\nAn ancestral dual function of OmpM as outer membrane tether and nutrient uptake channel in diderm Firmicutes\nAuthors: Silale, A.; Zhu, Y.; Witwinowski, J.; Smith, R. E.; Newman, K. E.; Bhamidimarri, S. P.; Basle, A.; Khalid, S.; BELOIN, C.; Gribaldo, S.; van den Berg, B.\nScore: 15.8, Published: 2023-08-14 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.14.552755\nThe outer membrane (OM) in diderm, or Gram-negative, bacteria must be tethered to peptidoglycan (PG) for mechanical stability and to maintain cell morphology. Most diderm phyla from the Terrabacteria group lack well-characterised OM attachment systems such as Brauns lipoprotein, Pal and OmpA, but instead have the OmpM protein. OmpM has a periplasmic region containing an S-layer homology domain and a {beta}-barrel region that is embedded in the OM. Here, we have determined the structure of the most abundant OmpM protein from the diderm firmicute Veillonella parvula by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We reveal an OM portion similar to well-characterised trimeric general porins and a mobile periplasmic PG-binding region. Combining the cryo-EM data with crystal structures, structure predictions and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the periplasmic region of OmpM likely adopts multiple conformations. Single-channel electrophysiology demonstrates ion conductance properties similar to E. coli OmpF. Finally, we demonstrate via functional assays that the four OmpM paralogues are likely to be the only general porins in V. parvula. Together, our results show that OM tethering and nutrient acquisition are genetically linked in V. parvula (and other diderm Firmicutes), suggesting that concurrent loss of two key OM-related functions, tethering and nutrient uptake, promoted the multiple OM loss events that have been inferred in the Terrabacteria.\nSHRIMP: Genetically Encoded mScarlet-derived Red Fluorescent Hydrogen Peroxide Sensor with High Brightness and Minimal Photoactivation\nAuthors: Pang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Li, Z.; He, Y.; Wang, Y.; Oberholzer, J.; Ai, H.\nScore: 18.6, Published: 2023-08-09 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.09.552302\nRed fluorescent protein (RFP) derived indicators are popular due to advantages such as increased imaging depth and reduced autofluorescence and cytotoxicity. However, most RFP-based indicators have low brightness and are susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of existing red fluorescent indicators. We utilized mScarlet-I, a highly bright and robust monomeric RFP, to develop a circularly permuted variant called cpmScarlet. We further engineered cpmScarlet into a novel red fluorescent indicator specifically for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signaling and oxidative stress. The resultant indicator, SHRIMP (mScarlet-derived H2O2 Redox Indicator with Minimal Photoactivation), exhibited excitation and emission peaks at [~]570 and 595 nm, respectively, and demonstrated a maximum five-fold fluorescence turn-off response to H2O2. Importantly, SHRIMP was not susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation and showed high brightness both in its purified protein form and when expressed in mammalian cells. We successfully employed SHRIMP to visualize H2O2 dynamics in mammalian cells with exogenously added H2O2 and in activated macrophages. Additionally, we demonstrated its utility for multiparameter imaging by co-expressing SHRIMP with GCaMP6m, a green fluorescent calcium indicator, enabling simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and calcium dynamics in mammalian cells in response to thapsigargin (TG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, we expressed SHRIMP in isolated primary mouse islet tissue, and SHRIMP exhibited excellent brightness and capability for effective detection of H2O2 production during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced {beta}-cell damage. This study successfully transformed mScarlet-I, a bright and robust monomeric RFP, into a circularly permuted variant (cpmScarlet) and developed the first cpmScarlet-based genetically encoded fluorescent indicator called SHRIMP. SHRIMP exhibits high brightness and insensitivity to photoactivation and is a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of H2O2 dynamics in various biological systems. Further research may yield an expanded family of cpmScarlet-based red fluorescent indicators with enhanced photophysical properties.\nThe ER-SURF pathway uses ER-mitochondria contact sites for protein targeting to mitochondria\nAuthors: Koch, C.; Raeschle, M.; Prescianotto-Baschong, C.; Spang, A.; Herrmann, J. M.\nScore: 33.7, Published: 2023-08-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.10.552816\nMost mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria in a post-translational reaction. Mitochondrial precursor proteins which use the ER-SURF pathway employ the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an important sorting platform. How they reach the mitochondrial import machinery from the ER is not known. Here we show that mitochondrial contact sites play a crucial role in the ER-to-mitochondria transfer of precursor proteins. The ER encounter structure (ERMES) and Tom70 are part of two parallel and partially redundant ER-to-mitochondria transfer routes. When ER-to-mitochondria transfer is prevented, many mitochondrial precursor proteins associate with ER membranes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Our observations support an active role of the ER in mitochondrial protein biogenesis.\nTargeted Protein Degradation through Recruitment of the CUL4A Complex Adaptor Protein DDB1\nAuthors: Meyers, M.; Cismoski, S.; Panidapu, A.; Chie-Leon, B.; Nomura, D. K.\nScore: 10.5, Published: 2023-08-12 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.11.553046\nTargeted protein degradation has arisen as a powerful therapeutic modality for eliminating proteins. Thus far, most heterobifunctional Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have utilized recruiters against substrate receptors of Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as cereblon and VHL. However, previous studies have surprisingly uncovered molecular glue degraders that exploit a CUL4A adaptor protein DDB1 to degrade neosubstrate proteins. Here, we sought to investigate whether DDB1 recruiters can be discovered that can be exploited for PROTAC applications. We utilized activity-based protein profiling and cysteine chemoproteomic screening to identify a covalent recruiter that targets C173 on DDB1 and exploited this recruiter to develop PROTACs against BRD4 and androgen receptor (AR). We demonstrated that the BRD4 PROTAC results in selective degradation of the short BRD4 isoform over the long isoform in a proteasome, NEDDylation, and DDB1-dependent manner. We also demonstrated degradation of AR with the AR PROTAC in prostate cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that covalent chemoproteomic approaches can be used to discover recruiters against Cullin RING adapter proteins and that these recruiters can be used for PROTAC applications to degrade neo-substrates.\nFucosylated glycoproteins and fucosylated glycolipids play opposing roles in cholera intoxication\nAuthors: Ghorashi, A. C.; Boucher, A.; Archer-hartmann, S. A.; Murray, N. B.; Konada, R. S. R.; Zhang, X.; Xing, C.; Azadi, P.; Yrlid, U.; Kohler, J. J.\nScore: 9.9, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.02.551727\nCholera toxin (CT) is the etiological agent of cholera. Here we report that multiple classes of fucosylated glycoconjugates function in CT binding and intoxication of intestinal epithelial cells. In Colo205 cells, knockout of B3GNT5, the enzyme required for synthesis of lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs), reduces CT binding but sensitizes cells to intoxication. Overexpressing B3GNT5 to generate more fucosylated GSLs confers protection against intoxication, indicating that fucosylated GSLs act as decoy receptors for CT. Knockout (KO) of B3GALT5 causes increased production of fucosylated O-linked and N-linked glycoproteins, and leads to increased CT binding and intoxication. Knockout of B3GNT5 in B3GALT5 KO cells eliminates production of fucosylated GSLs but increases intoxication, identifying fucosylated glycoproteins as functional receptors for CT. These findings provide insight into molecular determinants regulating CT sensitivity of host cells.\nLiquid-liquid phase separation of alpha-synuclein is highly sensitive to sequence complexity\nAuthors: Mahapatra, A.; Newberry, R. W.\nScore: 13.4, Published: 2023-08-03 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.03.551831\nThe Parkinsons-associated protein -synuclein (-syn) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which typically leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. The coincidence of LLPS and amyloid formation has complicated the identification of the molecular determinants unique to LLPS of -syn. Moreover, the lack of strategies to selectively perturb LLPS makes it difficult to dissect the biological roles specific to -syn LLPS, independent of fibrillation. Herein, using a combination of subtle missense mutations, we show that LLPS of -syn is highly sensitive to its sequence complexity. In fact, we find that even a highly conservative mutation (V16I) that increases sequence complexity without perturbing physicochemical and structural properties, is sufficient to reduce LLPS by 75%; this effect can be reversed by an adjacent V-to-I mutation (V15I) that restores the original sequence complexity. A18T, a complexity-enhancing PD-associated mutation, was likewise found to reduce LLPS, implicating sequence complexity in -syn pathogenicity. Furthermore, leveraging the differences in LLPS propensities among different -syn variants, we demonstrate that fibrillation of -syn does not necessarily correlate with its LLPS. In fact, we identify mutations that selectively perturb LLPS or fibrillation of -syn, unlike previously studied mutations. The variants and design principles reported herein should therefore empower future studies to disentangle these two phenomena and distinguish their (patho)biological roles.\nBacteriophage P22 SieA mediated superinfection exclusion\nAuthors: Leavitt, J. C.; Woodbury, B. M.; Gilcrease, E. B.; Bridges, C. M.; Teschke, C. M.; Casjens, S. R.\nScore: 9.1, Published: 2023-08-16 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.15.553423\nMany temperate phages encode prophage-expressed functions that interfere with superinfection of the host bacterium by external phages. Salmonella phage P22 has four such systems that are expressed from the prophage in a lysogen that are encoded by the c2 (repressor), gtrABC, sieA, and sieB genes. Here we report that the P22-encoded SieA protein is the only phage protein required for exclusion by the SieA system, and that it is an inner membrane protein that blocks DNA injection by P22 and its relatives, but has no effect on infection by other tailed phage types. The P22 virion injects its DNA through the host cell membranes and periplasm via a conduit assembled from three ejection proteins after their release from the virion. Phage P22 mutants were isolated that overcome the SieA block, and they have amino acid changes in the C-terminal regions of the gene 16 and 20 encoded ejection proteins. Three different single amino acid changes in these proteins are required to obtain nearly full resistance to SieA. Hybrid P22 phages that have phage HK620 ejection protein genes are also partially resistant to SieA. There are three sequence types of extant phage-encoded SieA proteins that are less than 30% identical to one another, yet comparison of two of these types found no differences in target specificity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the inner membrane protein SieA interferes with the assembly or function of the periplasmic gp20 and membrane-bound gp16 DNA delivery conduit.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Native mass spectrometry (native MS) is a powerful technique that provides information on stoichiometry, interactions, homogeneity and shape of protein complexes. However, the extent of deviation between protein structures in the mass spectrometer and in solution remains a matter of debate. Here, we uncover the gas-phase structure of {beta}-galactosidase using single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) down to 2.6 A resolution, enabled by soft-landing of mass-selected protein complexes onto cold TEM grids and in-situ ice coating. We find that large parts of the secondary and tertiary structure are retained from solution, with dehydration-driven subunit reorientation leading to consistent compaction in the gas phase. Our work enables visualizing the structure of gas-phase protein complexes from numerous experimental scenarios at side-chain resolution and demonstrates the possibility of more controlled cryo-EM sample preparation.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The detection of molecular patterns associated with invading pathogens is a hallmark of innate immune systems. Prokaryotes deploy sophisticated host-defense mechanisms in innate anti-phage immunity. Shedu is a single-component defense system comprising a putative nuclease SduA. Here we report cryo-EM structures of apo- and dsDNA-bound tetrameric SduA assemblies, revealing that the N-terminal domains of SduA form a clamp that recognizes free DNA ends. End binding positions the DNA over the PD/ExK nuclease domain, resulting in dsDNA nicking at a fixed distance from the 5 end. The end-directed DNA nicking activity of Shedu prevents propagation of linear DNA in vivo. Finally, we show that phages escape Shedu immunity by suppressing their recombination-dependent DNA replication pathway. Taken together, these results define the antiviral mechanism of Shedu systems, underlining the paradigm that recognition of pathogen-specific nucleic acid structures is a conserved feature of innate immunity across all domains of life.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The bacterial Makes caterpillars floppy 1 (Mcf1) toxin promotes apoptosis in insects, leading to loss of body turgor and death. The molecular mechanism underlying Mcf1 intoxication is poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of Mcf1 from Photorhabdus luminescens, revealing a seahorse-like shape with a head and tail. While the three head domains contain two effectors, an activator-binding domain (ABD) and an autoprotease, the tail consists of two translocation as well as three receptor-binding domains. Rearrangement of the tail moves the C-terminus away from the ABD and allows binding of the host cell ADP-ribosylation factor 3, inducing conformational changes that position the cleavage site closer to the protease. This unique activation mechanism that is based on a hook-loop interaction results in three autocleavage reactions and the release of two toxic effectors. Unexpectedly, the BH3-like domain containing ABD is not an active effector. Our findings allow us to understand key steps of Mcf1 intoxication at the molecular level.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The outer membrane (OM) in diderm, or Gram-negative, bacteria must be tethered to peptidoglycan (PG) for mechanical stability and to maintain cell morphology. Most diderm phyla from the Terrabacteria group lack well-characterised OM attachment systems such as Brauns lipoprotein, Pal and OmpA, but instead have the OmpM protein. OmpM has a periplasmic region containing an S-layer homology domain and a {beta}-barrel region that is embedded in the OM. Here, we have determined the structure of the most abundant OmpM protein from the diderm firmicute Veillonella parvula by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We reveal an OM portion similar to well-characterised trimeric general porins and a mobile periplasmic PG-binding region. Combining the cryo-EM data with crystal structures, structure predictions and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the periplasmic region of OmpM likely adopts multiple conformations. Single-channel electrophysiology demonstrates ion conductance properties similar to E. coli OmpF. Finally, we demonstrate via functional assays that the four OmpM paralogues are likely to be the only general porins in V. parvula. Together, our results show that OM tethering and nutrient acquisition are genetically linked in V. parvula (and other diderm Firmicutes), suggesting that concurrent loss of two key OM-related functions, tethering and nutrient uptake, promoted the multiple OM loss events that have been inferred in the Terrabacteria.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Red fluorescent protein (RFP) derived indicators are popular due to advantages such as increased imaging depth and reduced autofluorescence and cytotoxicity. However, most RFP-based indicators have low brightness and are susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation. In this study, we aimed to overcome the limitations of existing red fluorescent indicators. We utilized mScarlet-I, a highly bright and robust monomeric RFP, to develop a circularly permuted variant called cpmScarlet. We further engineered cpmScarlet into a novel red fluorescent indicator specifically for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a crucial reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in redox signaling and oxidative stress. The resultant indicator, SHRIMP (mScarlet-derived H2O2 Redox Indicator with Minimal Photoactivation), exhibited excitation and emission peaks at [~]570 and 595 nm, respectively, and demonstrated a maximum five-fold fluorescence turn-off response to H2O2. Importantly, SHRIMP was not susceptible to blue-light-induced photoactivation and showed high brightness both in its purified protein form and when expressed in mammalian cells. We successfully employed SHRIMP to visualize H2O2 dynamics in mammalian cells with exogenously added H2O2 and in activated macrophages. Additionally, we demonstrated its utility for multiparameter imaging by co-expressing SHRIMP with GCaMP6m, a green fluorescent calcium indicator, enabling simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and calcium dynamics in mammalian cells in response to thapsigargin (TG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, we expressed SHRIMP in isolated primary mouse islet tissue, and SHRIMP exhibited excellent brightness and capability for effective detection of H2O2 production during streptozotocin (STZ)-induced {beta}-cell damage. This study successfully transformed mScarlet-I, a bright and robust monomeric RFP, into a circularly permuted variant (cpmScarlet) and developed the first cpmScarlet-based genetically encoded fluorescent indicator called SHRIMP. SHRIMP exhibits high brightness and insensitivity to photoactivation and is a valuable tool for real-time monitoring of H2O2 dynamics in various biological systems. Further research may yield an expanded family of cpmScarlet-based red fluorescent indicators with enhanced photophysical properties.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria in a post-translational reaction. Mitochondrial precursor proteins which use the ER-SURF pathway employ the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an important sorting platform. How they reach the mitochondrial import machinery from the ER is not known. Here we show that mitochondrial contact sites play a crucial role in the ER-to-mitochondria transfer of precursor proteins. The ER encounter structure (ERMES) and Tom70 are part of two parallel and partially redundant ER-to-mitochondria transfer routes. When ER-to-mitochondria transfer is prevented, many mitochondrial precursor proteins associate with ER membranes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Our observations support an active role of the ER in mitochondrial protein biogenesis.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Targeted protein degradation has arisen as a powerful therapeutic modality for eliminating proteins. Thus far, most heterobifunctional Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have utilized recruiters against substrate receptors of Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as cereblon and VHL. However, previous studies have surprisingly uncovered molecular glue degraders that exploit a CUL4A adaptor protein DDB1 to degrade neosubstrate proteins. Here, we sought to investigate whether DDB1 recruiters can be discovered that can be exploited for PROTAC applications. We utilized activity-based protein profiling and cysteine chemoproteomic screening to identify a covalent recruiter that targets C173 on DDB1 and exploited this recruiter to develop PROTACs against BRD4 and androgen receptor (AR). We demonstrated that the BRD4 PROTAC results in selective degradation of the short BRD4 isoform over the long isoform in a proteasome, NEDDylation, and DDB1-dependent manner. We also demonstrated degradation of AR with the AR PROTAC in prostate cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that covalent chemoproteomic approaches can be used to discover recruiters against Cullin RING adapter proteins and that these recruiters can be used for PROTAC applications to degrade neo-substrates.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Cholera toxin (CT) is the etiological agent of cholera. Here we report that multiple classes of fucosylated glycoconjugates function in CT binding and intoxication of intestinal epithelial cells. In Colo205 cells, knockout of B3GNT5, the enzyme required for synthesis of lacto- and neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (GSLs), reduces CT binding but sensitizes cells to intoxication. Overexpressing B3GNT5 to generate more fucosylated GSLs confers protection against intoxication, indicating that fucosylated GSLs act as decoy receptors for CT. Knockout (KO) of B3GALT5 causes increased production of fucosylated O-linked and N-linked glycoproteins, and leads to increased CT binding and intoxication. Knockout of B3GNT5 in B3GALT5 KO cells eliminates production of fucosylated GSLs but increases intoxication, identifying fucosylated glycoproteins as functional receptors for CT. These findings provide insight into molecular determinants regulating CT sensitivity of host cells.</p>

        <p class="abstract">The Parkinsons-associated protein -synuclein (-syn) can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which typically leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. The coincidence of LLPS and amyloid formation has complicated the identification of the molecular determinants unique to LLPS of -syn. Moreover, the lack of strategies to selectively perturb LLPS makes it difficult to dissect the biological roles specific to -syn LLPS, independent of fibrillation. Herein, using a combination of subtle missense mutations, we show that LLPS of -syn is highly sensitive to its sequence complexity. In fact, we find that even a highly conservative mutation (V16I) that increases sequence complexity without perturbing physicochemical and structural properties, is sufficient to reduce LLPS by 75%; this effect can be reversed by an adjacent V-to-I mutation (V15I) that restores the original sequence complexity. A18T, a complexity-enhancing PD-associated mutation, was likewise found to reduce LLPS, implicating sequence complexity in -syn pathogenicity. Furthermore, leveraging the differences in LLPS propensities among different -syn variants, we demonstrate that fibrillation of -syn does not necessarily correlate with its LLPS. In fact, we identify mutations that selectively perturb LLPS or fibrillation of -syn, unlike previously studied mutations. The variants and design principles reported herein should therefore empower future studies to disentangle these two phenomena and distinguish their (patho)biological roles.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Many temperate phages encode prophage-expressed functions that interfere with superinfection of the host bacterium by external phages. Salmonella phage P22 has four such systems that are expressed from the prophage in a lysogen that are encoded by the c2 (repressor), gtrABC, sieA, and sieB genes. Here we report that the P22-encoded SieA protein is the only phage protein required for exclusion by the SieA system, and that it is an inner membrane protein that blocks DNA injection by P22 and its relatives, but has no effect on infection by other tailed phage types. The P22 virion injects its DNA through the host cell membranes and periplasm via a conduit assembled from three ejection proteins after their release from the virion. Phage P22 mutants were isolated that overcome the SieA block, and they have amino acid changes in the C-terminal regions of the gene 16 and 20 encoded ejection proteins. Three different single amino acid changes in these proteins are required to obtain nearly full resistance to SieA. Hybrid P22 phages that have phage HK620 ejection protein genes are also partially resistant to SieA. There are three sequence types of extant phage-encoded SieA proteins that are less than 30% identical to one another, yet comparison of two of these types found no differences in target specificity. Our data are consistent with a model in which the inner membrane protein SieA interferes with the assembly or function of the periplasmic gp20 and membrane-bound gp16 DNA delivery conduit.</p>
