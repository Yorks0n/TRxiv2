In addition, the molecular mechanisms of peptide- receptor binding are only known for a few examples, primarily owing to the limited availability of structural capabilities to few laboratories worldwide. Plants have evolved a multitude of secreted signaling peptides and corresponding transmembrane receptors. Stress-responsive SERINE RICH ENDOGENOUS PEPTIDES (SCOOPs) were recently identified. Bioactive SCOOPs are proteolytically processed by subtilases and are perceived by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. How SCOOPs and MIK2 have (co-)evolved, and how SCOOPs bind to MIK2 are however still unknown. Using in silico analysis of 350 plant genomes and subsequent functional testing, we revealed the conservation of MIK2 as SCOOP receptor within the plant order Brassicales. We then leveraged AlphaFold-Multimer and comparative genomics to identify two conserved putative SCOOP-MIK2 binding pockets across Brassicales MIK2 homologues predicted to interact with the SxS motif of otherwise sequence-divergent SCOOPs. Notably, mutagenesis of both predicted binding pockets compromised SCOOP binding to MIK2, SCOOP-induced complex formation between MIK2 and its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and SCOOP-induced reactive oxygen species production; thus, confirming our in silico predictions. Collectively, in addition to revealing the elusive SCOOP-MIK2 binding mechanisms, our analytic pipeline combining phylogenomics, AI-based structural predictions, and experimental biochemical and physiological validation provides a blueprint for the elucidation of peptide ligand-receptor perception mechanisms.\nIdentification of extracellular membrane protein ENPP3 as a major cGAMP hydrolase, cementing cGAMP's role as an immunotransmitter\nAuthors: Mardjuki, R.; Wang, S.; Carozza, J.; Abhiraman, G.; Lyu, X.; Li, L.\nScore: 23.6, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575449\ncGAMP is a second messenger that is synthesized in the cytosol upon detection of cytosolic dsDNA and passed between cells to facilitate downstream immune signaling. ENPP1, an extracellular enzyme, was the only metazoan cGAMP hydrolase known to regulate cGAMP levels to dampen anti-cancer immunity. Here, we uncover ENPP3 as the second and only other metazoan cGAMP hydrolase under homeostatic conditions. ENPP3 has a tissue expression pattern distinct from that of ENPP1 and accounts for all remaining cGAMP hydrolysis activity in mice lacking ENPP1. Importantly, we also show that as with ENPP1, selectively abolishing ENPP3s cGAMP hydrolase activity results in diminished cancer growth and metastasis of certain tumor types. Both ENPP1 and ENPP3 are extracellular enzymes, suggesting the dominant role that extracellular cGAMP must play as a mediator of cell-cell innate immune communication. Our work clearly shows that ENPP1 and ENPP3 non-redundantly dampen extracellular cGAMP-STING signaling, pointing to ENPP3 as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.\nMulti-state kinetics of the syringe-like injection mechanism of Tc toxins\nAuthors: Ng`ang`a, P. N.; Folz, J.; Kucher, S.; Roderer, D.; Xu, Y.; Sitsel, O.; Belyy, A.; Prumbaum, D.; Kuehnemuth, R.; Assafa, T. E.; Dong, M.; Seidel, C. A. M.; Bordignon, E.; Raunser, S.\nScore: 22.1, Published: 2024-01-16 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.16.575634\nTc toxins are virulence factors of many insects and human pathogenic bacteria. They attach as soluble prepores to receptors on host cells and following acidification in the late endosome, perforate the cell membrane like a syringe to translocate toxic enzymes into the host cell through their pore-forming channel. Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the functional aspects of this large-scale rearrangement, such as the reaction pathway with possible intermediate states and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. Here, we used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor the prepore-to-pore transition and found that it takes [~]28 h when induced by high pH in the absence of other factors. In the presence of liposomes, an increasingly high pH or receptors, such as heparin or Vsg, the probability to transform prepores to pores increases by a factor of up to 4. This effect can also be mimicked by biotinylation or site-directed mutagenesis of the shell, demonstrating that shell destabilization is a crucial step in prepore-to-pore transition. We show that shell opening is a heterogeneous process with transition times ranging from 60 ms to 1.6 s and resolve three sequential intermediate states: an initial transient intermediate during shell destabilization, a first stable intermediate where the receptor-binding domains on the shell rearrange and a second stable intermediate with an open shell. In contrast, the ejection of the pore-forming channel from the open shell is highly cooperative with a transition time of \u003c 60 ms. This detailed knowledge of the Tc toxin mechanism of action, even in the absence of receptors, is important for the future application of Tc toxins as biomedical devices or biopesticides.\nExpanding the ligandable proteome by paralog hopping with covalent probes\nAuthors: Zhang, Y.; Liu, Z.; Hirschi, M.; Brodsky, O.; Johnson, E.; Won, S. J.; Nagata, A.; Petroski, M. D.; Majmudar, J. D.; Niessen, S.; VanArsdale, T.; Gilbert, A. M.; Hayward, M. M.; Stewart, A. E.; Nager, A. R.; Melillo, B.; Cravatt, B. F.\nScore: 21.4, Published: 2024-01-20 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.18.576274\nMore than half of the ~20,000 protein-encoding human genes have at least one paralog. Chemical proteomics has uncovered many electrophile-sensitive cysteines that are exclusive to a subset of paralogous proteins. Here, we explore whether such covalent compound-cysteine interactions can be used to discover ligandable pockets in paralogs that lack the cysteine. Leveraging the covalent ligandability of C109 in the cyclin CCNE2, we mutated the corresponding residue in paralog CCNE1 to cysteine (N112C) and found through activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) that this mutant reacts stereoselectively and site-specifically with tryptoline acrylamides. We then converted the tryptoline acrylamide-N112C-CCNE1 interaction into a NanoBRET-ABPP assay capable of identifying compounds that reversibly inhibit both N112C- and WT-CCNE1:CDK2 complexes. X-ray crystallography revealed a cryptic allosteric pocket at the CCNE1:CDK2 interface adjacent to N112 that binds the reversible inhibitors. Our findings thus provide a roadmap for leveraging electrophile-cysteine interactions to extend the ligandability of the proteome beyond covalent chemistry.\nCell Cycle Regulation has Shaped Budding Yeast Replication Origin Structure and Function\nAuthors: Diffley, J.; Lim, C. T.; Miller, T. C.; Tan, K. W.; Talele, s.; Early, A.; East, P.; Sanchez, H.; Dekker, N. H.; Costa, A.\nScore: 14.7, Published: 2024-01-10 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.10.575016\nEukaryotic DNA replication initiates from multiple genomic loci known as origins. At budding yeast origins like ARS1, a double hexamer (DH) of the MCM replicative helicase is assembled by Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 via sequential hexamer loading from two opposed ORC binding sites. Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) inhibits DH assembly, which prevents re-replication by restricting helicase loading to G1 phase. Here we show that an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the Orc2 subunit promotes interaction between ORC and the first loaded, closed-ring MCM hexamer (the MO intermediate); CDK phosphorylation of this IDR blocks MO formation and DH assembly. We show that MO functions by stabilising ORC at the lower affinity binding sites required for second hexamer loading. Origins comprising two high affinity ORC sites can assemble DH efficiently without MO by independently loading single hexamers; these origins escape CDK inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our work reveals mechanistic plasticity in MCM loading with implications for understanding how CDK regulation has shaped yeast origin evolution and how natural origins might escape cell cycle regulation. We also identify key steps common to loading pathways, with implications for understanding how MCM is loaded in other eukaryotes.\nDefining a small-molecule stimulator of the human Hsp70-disaggregase system with selectivity for DnaJB proteins\nAuthors: Chuang, E.; Cupo, R. R.; Bevan, J. R.; Rice, M. L.; Mao, S.; Gorenberg, E. L.; Mack, K. L.; Huryn, D. M.; Wipf, P.; Brodsky, J. L.; Shorter, J.\nScore: 9.2, Published: 2024-01-12 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.11.575109\nHsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 form a human protein-disaggregase system that solubilizes and reactivates proteins trapped in aggregated states. However, this system fails to maintain proteostasis in fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we potentiate the human Hsp70-disaggregase system pharmacologically. By scouring a collection of dihydropyrimidines, we disambiguate a small molecule that specifically stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system against disordered aggregates and -synuclein fibrils. The newly identified lead compound stimulates the disaggregase activity of multiple active human Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp110 chaperone sets, with selectivity for combinations that include DnaJB1 or DnaJB4 as the Hsp40. We find that the relative stoichiometry of Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 dictates disaggregase activity. Remarkably, our lead compound shifts the composition of active chaperone stoichiometries by preferentially activating combinations with lower DnaJB1 concentrations. Our findings unveil a small molecule that stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system, even at suboptimal chaperone stoichiometries, which could be developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

E.; Lee, W.-H.; Ward, A. B.\nScore: 6.4, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.03.560740\nThe dimeric two-pore OSCA/TMEM63 family has recently been identified as mechanically activated ion channels. Previously, based on the unique features of the structure of OSCA1.2, we postulated the potential involvement of several structural elements in sensing membrane tension1. Interestingly, while OSCA1, 2, and 3 clades are activated by membrane stretch in cell-attached patches (i.e., they are stretch-activated channels), they differ in their ability to transduce membrane deformation induced by a blunt probe (poking). In an effort to understand the domains contributing to mechanical signal transduction, we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana (At) OSCA3.1, which, unlike AtOSCA1.2, only produced stretch- but not poke-activated currents in our initial characterization2. Mutagenesis and electrophysiological assessment of conserved and divergent putative mechanosensitive features of OSCA1.2 reveal a selective disruption of the macroscopic currents elicited by poking without considerable effects on stretch-activated currents (SAC). Our results support the involvement of the amphipathic helix and lipid-interacting residues in the membrane fenestration in the response to poking. Our findings position these two structural elements as potential sources of functional diversity within the family.\nDroplet microfluidics for time-resolved serial crystallography\nAuthors: Stubbs, J.; Hornsey, T.; Hanrahan, N.; Blay-Esteban, L.; Bolton, R.; Maly, M.; Basu, S.; Orlans, J.; de Sanctis, D.; Shim, J.-u.; Shaw Stewart, P. D.; Orville, A. M.; Tews, I.; West, J.\nScore: 4.8, Published: 2024-01-13 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.12.575388\nSerial crystallography requires large numbers of microcrystals and robust strategies to rapidly apply substrates to initiate reactions in time-resolved studies. Here we report the use of droplet miniaturisation for the controlled production of uniform crystals, providing an avenue for controlled diffusion and synchronous reaction initiation. The approach was evaluated using two enzymatic systems, yielding 3-{micro}m lysozyme crystals and 2-{micro}m crystals of Pdx1, an Arabidopsis enzyme involved in vitamin B6 biosynthesis. A seeding strategy was used to overcome the improbability of Pdx1 nucleation occurring with diminishing droplet volumes. Convection within droplets was exploited for rapid crystal mixing with ligands. Mixing times of \u003c2 milliseconds were achieved. Droplet microfluidics for crystal size engineering and rapid micromixing can be used to advance time-resolved serial crystallography.\nStructure of an open KATP channel reveals tandem PIP2 binding sites mediating the Kir6.2 and SUR1 regulatory interface\nAuthors: Driggers, C. M.; Kuo, Y.-Y.; Zhu, P.; ElSheikh, A.; Shyng, S.-L.\nScore: 9.4, Published: 2024-01-11 DOI: 10.1101/2023.08.01.551546\nATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of four pore-lining Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits, control insulin secretion in pancreatic {beta}-cells. KATP channel opening is stimulated by PIP2 and inhibited by ATP. Mutations that increase channel opening by PIP2 reduce ATP inhibition and cause neonatal diabetes. Although considerable evidence has implicated a role for PIP2 in KATP channel function, previously solved open-channel structures have lacked bound PIP2, and mechanisms by which PIP2 regulates KATP channels remain unresolved. Here, we report cryoEM structure of a KATP channel harboring the neonatal diabetes mutation Kir6.2-Q52R, bound to natural C18:0/C20:4 long-chain PI(4,5)P2 in open conformation. The structure reveals two adjacent PIP2 molecules between SUR1 and Kir6.2. The first PIP2 binding site is conserved among PIP2-gated Kir channels. The second site forms uniquely in KATP at the interface of Kir6.2 and SUR1. Functional studies demonstrate both binding sites determine channel activity. Kir6.2 pore opening is associated with a twist of the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain and a rotation of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1, which widens the inhibitory ATP binding pocket to disfavor ATP binding. The open conformation is particularly stabilized by the Kir6.2-Q52R residue through cation-{pi} bonding with SUR1 - W51. Together, these results uncover the cooperation between SUR1 and Kir6.2 in PIP2 binding and gating, explain the antagonistic regulation of KATP channels by PIP2 and ATP, and provide the mechanism by which Kir6.2-Q52R stabilizes an open channel to cause neonatal diabetes.\nFunctional diversity in the Hsp60 of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius: mosaic of Group I and Group II chaperonin\nAuthors: Bhakta, K.; Roy, M.; Samanta, S.; Ghosh, A.\nScore: 4.3, Published: 2024-01-15 DOI: 10.1101/2024.01.14.575554\nExternal stress can disrupt protein homeostasis in organisms, necessitating the involvement of heat shock proteins (Hsps) to restore equilibrium and ensure survival. Unlike other organisms, the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius lacks Hsp100, Hsp90, and Hsp70, possessing only two small heat shock proteins (Hsp14 and Hsp20) and one group II chaperonin, Hsp60. This raises questions about how protein substrates are protected and transferred to Hsp60 for refolding without other chaperones. Our study focused on ATP-dependent Hsp60 in S. acidocaldarius, revealing its formation of oligomeric structures in the presence of ATP. While ATP hydrolysis is not essential for oligomer formation and lid closure, it is crucial for Hsp60s chaperone activity, effectively folding stress-denatured substrate proteins by stabilizing their folded conformations. The mechanism involves hydrophobic recognition of unfolded substrates, encapsulating and releasing them in a more folded state. Negatively charged inner surface of the ring seems to be responsible for driving the folding of the substrate. Importantly, Hsp14 was found to transfer substrate proteins to Hsp60{beta}, orchestrating their refolding into an active state. Beyond protein folding, Hsp60{beta} protects the membrane under stress, contributing to maintaining membrane rigidity. Hsp60 exhibits nested cooperativity in ATPase activity, adapting to ATP concentration changes and interestingly Hsp60{beta} and Hsp60{beta} complex shows a mosaic behaviour during ATP hydrolysis belonging to both group I and group II chaperonin respectively. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the intricate mechanisms employed by Hsp60 in S. acidocaldarius to maintain protein homeostasis. It offers a comprehensive understanding of Hsp60s role in the heat shock response pathway, shedding light on fundamental cellular processes in extremophilic archaea.\n",

        <p class="abstract">Secreted signaling peptides are central regulators of growth, development, and stress responses, but specific steps in the evolution of these peptides and their receptors are not well understood. In addition, the molecular mechanisms of peptide- receptor binding are only known for a few examples, primarily owing to the limited availability of structural capabilities to few laboratories worldwide. Plants have evolved a multitude of secreted signaling peptides and corresponding transmembrane receptors. Stress-responsive SERINE RICH ENDOGENOUS PEPTIDES (SCOOPs) were recently identified. Bioactive SCOOPs are proteolytically processed by subtilases and are perceived by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. How SCOOPs and MIK2 have (co-)evolved, and how SCOOPs bind to MIK2 are however still unknown. Using in silico analysis of 350 plant genomes and subsequent functional testing, we revealed the conservation of MIK2 as SCOOP receptor within the plant order Brassicales. We then leveraged AlphaFold-Multimer and comparative genomics to identify two conserved putative SCOOP-MIK2 binding pockets across Brassicales MIK2 homologues predicted to interact with the SxS motif of otherwise sequence-divergent SCOOPs. Notably, mutagenesis of both predicted binding pockets compromised SCOOP binding to MIK2, SCOOP-induced complex formation between MIK2 and its co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1), and SCOOP-induced reactive oxygen species production; thus, confirming our in silico predictions. Collectively, in addition to revealing the elusive SCOOP-MIK2 binding mechanisms, our analytic pipeline combining phylogenomics, AI-based structural predictions, and experimental biochemical and physiological validation provides a blueprint for the elucidation of peptide ligand-receptor perception mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="abstract">cGAMP is a second messenger that is synthesized in the cytosol upon detection of cytosolic dsDNA and passed between cells to facilitate downstream immune signaling. ENPP1, an extracellular enzyme, was the only metazoan cGAMP hydrolase known to regulate cGAMP levels to dampen anti-cancer immunity. Here, we uncover ENPP3 as the second and only other metazoan cGAMP hydrolase under homeostatic conditions. ENPP3 has a tissue expression pattern distinct from that of ENPP1 and accounts for all remaining cGAMP hydrolysis activity in mice lacking ENPP1. Importantly, we also show that as with ENPP1, selectively abolishing ENPP3s cGAMP hydrolase activity results in diminished cancer growth and metastasis of certain tumor types. Both ENPP1 and ENPP3 are extracellular enzymes, suggesting the dominant role that extracellular cGAMP must play as a mediator of cell-cell innate immune communication. Our work clearly shows that ENPP1 and ENPP3 non-redundantly dampen extracellular cGAMP-STING signaling, pointing to ENPP3 as a new target for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Tc toxins are virulence factors of many insects and human pathogenic bacteria. They attach as soluble prepores to receptors on host cells and following acidification in the late endosome, perforate the cell membrane like a syringe to translocate toxic enzymes into the host cell through their pore-forming channel. Although this complex transformation has been structurally well studied, the functional aspects of this large-scale rearrangement, such as the reaction pathway with possible intermediate states and the resulting temporal evolution have remained elusive. Here, we used an integrated biophysical approach to monitor the prepore-to-pore transition and found that it takes [~]28 h when induced by high pH in the absence of other factors. In the presence of liposomes, an increasingly high pH or receptors, such as heparin or Vsg, the probability to transform prepores to pores increases by a factor of up to 4. This effect can also be mimicked by biotinylation or site-directed mutagenesis of the shell, demonstrating that shell destabilization is a crucial step in prepore-to-pore transition. We show that shell opening is a heterogeneous process with transition times ranging from 60 ms to 1.6 s and resolve three sequential intermediate states: an initial transient intermediate during shell destabilization, a first stable intermediate where the receptor-binding domains on the shell rearrange and a second stable intermediate with an open shell. In contrast, the ejection of the pore-forming channel from the open shell is highly cooperative with a transition time of &lt; 60 ms. This detailed knowledge of the Tc toxin mechanism of action, even in the absence of receptors, is important for the future application of Tc toxins as biomedical devices or biopesticides.</p>

        <p class="abstract">More than half of the ~20,000 protein-encoding human genes have at least one paralog. Chemical proteomics has uncovered many electrophile-sensitive cysteines that are exclusive to a subset of paralogous proteins. Here, we explore whether such covalent compound-cysteine interactions can be used to discover ligandable pockets in paralogs that lack the cysteine. Leveraging the covalent ligandability of C109 in the cyclin CCNE2, we mutated the corresponding residue in paralog CCNE1 to cysteine (N112C) and found through activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) that this mutant reacts stereoselectively and site-specifically with tryptoline acrylamides. We then converted the tryptoline acrylamide-N112C-CCNE1 interaction into a NanoBRET-ABPP assay capable of identifying compounds that reversibly inhibit both N112C- and WT-CCNE1:CDK2 complexes. X-ray crystallography revealed a cryptic allosteric pocket at the CCNE1:CDK2 interface adjacent to N112 that binds the reversible inhibitors. Our findings thus provide a roadmap for leveraging electrophile-cysteine interactions to extend the ligandability of the proteome beyond covalent chemistry.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Eukaryotic DNA replication initiates from multiple genomic loci known as origins. At budding yeast origins like ARS1, a double hexamer (DH) of the MCM replicative helicase is assembled by Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 via sequential hexamer loading from two opposed ORC binding sites. Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) inhibits DH assembly, which prevents re-replication by restricting helicase loading to G1 phase. Here we show that an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the Orc2 subunit promotes interaction between ORC and the first loaded, closed-ring MCM hexamer (the MO intermediate); CDK phosphorylation of this IDR blocks MO formation and DH assembly. We show that MO functions by stabilising ORC at the lower affinity binding sites required for second hexamer loading. Origins comprising two high affinity ORC sites can assemble DH efficiently without MO by independently loading single hexamers; these origins escape CDK inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Our work reveals mechanistic plasticity in MCM loading with implications for understanding how CDK regulation has shaped yeast origin evolution and how natural origins might escape cell cycle regulation. We also identify key steps common to loading pathways, with implications for understanding how MCM is loaded in other eukaryotes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 form a human protein-disaggregase system that solubilizes and reactivates proteins trapped in aggregated states. However, this system fails to maintain proteostasis in fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we potentiate the human Hsp70-disaggregase system pharmacologically. By scouring a collection of dihydropyrimidines, we disambiguate a small molecule that specifically stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system against disordered aggregates and -synuclein fibrils. The newly identified lead compound stimulates the disaggregase activity of multiple active human Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp110 chaperone sets, with selectivity for combinations that include DnaJB1 or DnaJB4 as the Hsp40. We find that the relative stoichiometry of Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp110 dictates disaggregase activity. Remarkably, our lead compound shifts the composition of active chaperone stoichiometries by preferentially activating combinations with lower DnaJB1 concentrations. Our findings unveil a small molecule that stimulates the Hsp70-disaggregase system, even at suboptimal chaperone stoichiometries, which could be developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

        <p class="abstract">The dimeric two-pore OSCA/TMEM63 family has recently been identified as mechanically activated ion channels. Previously, based on the unique features of the structure of OSCA1.2, we postulated the potential involvement of several structural elements in sensing membrane tension1. Interestingly, while OSCA1, 2, and 3 clades are activated by membrane stretch in cell-attached patches (i.e., they are stretch-activated channels), they differ in their ability to transduce membrane deformation induced by a blunt probe (poking). In an effort to understand the domains contributing to mechanical signal transduction, we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana (At) OSCA3.1, which, unlike AtOSCA1.2, only produced stretch- but not poke-activated currents in our initial characterization2. Mutagenesis and electrophysiological assessment of conserved and divergent putative mechanosensitive features of OSCA1.2 reveal a selective disruption of the macroscopic currents elicited by poking without considerable effects on stretch-activated currents (SAC). Our results support the involvement of the amphipathic helix and lipid-interacting residues in the membrane fenestration in the response to poking. Our findings position these two structural elements as potential sources of functional diversity within the family.</p>

        <p class="abstract">Serial crystallography requires large numbers of microcrystals and robust strategies to rapidly apply substrates to initiate reactions in time-resolved studies. Here we report the use of droplet miniaturisation for the controlled production of uniform crystals, providing an avenue for controlled diffusion and synchronous reaction initiation. The approach was evaluated using two enzymatic systems, yielding 3-{micro}m lysozyme crystals and 2-{micro}m crystals of Pdx1, an Arabidopsis enzyme involved in vitamin B6 biosynthesis. A seeding strategy was used to overcome the improbability of Pdx1 nucleation occurring with diminishing droplet volumes. Convection within droplets was exploited for rapid crystal mixing with ligands. Mixing times of &lt;2 milliseconds were achieved. Droplet microfluidics for crystal size engineering and rapid micromixing can be used to advance time-resolved serial crystallography.</p>

        <p class="abstract">ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, composed of four pore-lining Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits, control insulin secretion in pancreatic {beta}-cells. KATP channel opening is stimulated by PIP2 and inhibited by ATP. Mutations that increase channel opening by PIP2 reduce ATP inhibition and cause neonatal diabetes. Although considerable evidence has implicated a role for PIP2 in KATP channel function, previously solved open-channel structures have lacked bound PIP2, and mechanisms by which PIP2 regulates KATP channels remain unresolved. Here, we report cryoEM structure of a KATP channel harboring the neonatal diabetes mutation Kir6.2-Q52R, bound to natural C18:0/C20:4 long-chain PI(4,5)P2 in open conformation. The structure reveals two adjacent PIP2 molecules between SUR1 and Kir6.2. The first PIP2 binding site is conserved among PIP2-gated Kir channels. The second site forms uniquely in KATP at the interface of Kir6.2 and SUR1. Functional studies demonstrate both binding sites determine channel activity. Kir6.2 pore opening is associated with a twist of the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain and a rotation of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1, which widens the inhibitory ATP binding pocket to disfavor ATP binding. The open conformation is particularly stabilized by the Kir6.2-Q52R residue through cation-{pi} bonding with SUR1 - W51. Together, these results uncover the cooperation between SUR1 and Kir6.2 in PIP2 binding and gating, explain the antagonistic regulation of KATP channels by PIP2 and ATP, and provide the mechanism by which Kir6.2-Q52R stabilizes an open channel to cause neonatal diabetes.</p>

        <p class="abstract">External stress can disrupt protein homeostasis in organisms, necessitating the involvement of heat shock proteins (Hsps) to restore equilibrium and ensure survival. Unlike other organisms, the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius lacks Hsp100, Hsp90, and Hsp70, possessing only two small heat shock proteins (Hsp14 and Hsp20) and one group II chaperonin, Hsp60. This raises questions about how protein substrates are protected and transferred to Hsp60 for refolding without other chaperones. Our study focused on ATP-dependent Hsp60 in S. acidocaldarius, revealing its formation of oligomeric structures in the presence of ATP. While ATP hydrolysis is not essential for oligomer formation and lid closure, it is crucial for Hsp60s chaperone activity, effectively folding stress-denatured substrate proteins by stabilizing their folded conformations. The mechanism involves hydrophobic recognition of unfolded substrates, encapsulating and releasing them in a more folded state. Negatively charged inner surface of the ring seems to be responsible for driving the folding of the substrate. Importantly, Hsp14 was found to transfer substrate proteins to Hsp60{beta}, orchestrating their refolding into an active state. Beyond protein folding, Hsp60{beta} protects the membrane under stress, contributing to maintaining membrane rigidity. Hsp60 exhibits nested cooperativity in ATPase activity, adapting to ATP concentration changes and interestingly Hsp60{beta} and Hsp60{beta} complex shows a mosaic behaviour during ATP hydrolysis belonging to both group I and group II chaperonin respectively. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the intricate mechanisms employed by Hsp60 in S. acidocaldarius to maintain protein homeostasis. It offers a comprehensive understanding of Hsp60s role in the heat shock response pathway, shedding light on fundamental cellular processes in extremophilic archaea.</p>
